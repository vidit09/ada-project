null,null,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"I'm not calling Pochettino terrible for failing to get 4th place, but I am calling him out for what was a pretty underwhelming season.  I'm more than happy to trust the manager on a lot of things, but that doesn't mean turning a blind eye to areas that could use obvious improvement.  And unfortunately from Poch's first season, I personally saw more things that eroded my trust than built it.

His first season was worse than AVB's first season, and both were built on an over-reliance on one world class player to get more than a third of our points single-handedly.  Should Kane fail to fire anywhere near the same to last season, it would honestly not surprise me to see Poch defending his job come January.  That's not me calling for his head... it's simply based on Levy's previous form with managers.

I am giving the manager a chance, but I'm also assessing him on the basis on what's in front of us.  And it is, despite finishing 5th (not 6th by the way), a pretty poor season of underwhelming football, bad rotation, dubious squad management, poor substitutions, and no tactical plan B.

It's not the sum total of his contribution to the club, but honestly, we were a Harry Kane hamstring away from finishing 8th - 10th last season (and, unless a miracle happens in the last vestiges of this transfer window, still are).

I'm sure Capoue fucked up to get what happened to him, but what would you rather... an unyielding disciplinarian who puts principles before points, or someone who's willing to work on a more personal level with the hand he's actually been dealt, working on the psychology of the needier players in the squad until he gets something useful out of them?

Obviously management isn't as binary as that, but I'm a film/TV director, and the job is pretty similar to football management.  I don't get in front of the camera, just as managers don't get on the pitch.  Both jobs involve us having to encourage and inspire people to do our bidding to get the best possible result.  And some days I get shit cast or crew members.

And yet I've found from my 13 years in the industry, that rejecting them yields far worse results than taking the time to figure out what actually makes them tick, and playing to their strengths.

The thing is, we can't get world class players in the prime of their career at the moment.  We aren't the attractive, upwardly mobile club knocking on the door of the top 4 any more.  We are a Europa-league mainstay, financially hobbled in the short-term by our stadium commitment.

A few years ago under Redknapp, Delph would've come to us this window.  Now, he's goes to City.  A FWA Footballer of the Year like Parker wouldn't join us right now... we're just not in the same place.

And so our lot in life is to play moneyball - chancing our arm on talented youngsters, and buying misfits and slightly over-the-hill players who are good but limited in their capacities.

I'm not specifically arguing for Jedinak, but he has qualities that no one else in our side currently does.  He's not some top 4 monster like Matic or Toure, but we're never in the running for players like that anyway.  He's probably not the best option available, but he's not the worst either.

And yeah, Pochettino seems to put a lot of emphasis on training performance.  Hence he puts in Ryan Mason out of nowhere and Mason turns our season around (yes, I think the win against Forest was that important).  

I like Pochettino, I think he has a lot of good qualities and is a good coach for us for where we are right now.  But he does not run a meritocracy based on match performance.  I totally disagree with you that the players I mentioned ""had their chances.""  Dribs and drabs do not give a fair chance to a player, and certainly not one with as long a track record as Aaron Lennon.  Not once last season did Lennon start two matches in a row for us.  And Soldado?  Never started two Prem matches in a row, and every time he actually started and scored (in any competition), he was back on the bench the next match.  Pochettino never gave these guys a chance to round into any sort of form.

As for Adebayor, as I said, he had a run of games at the start of the season but was never fit.  Honestly, Pochettino mismanaged him, and our whole striker situation, badly at the beginning of the season.  He never should have been playing against West Ham in week 1 ... it was obvious from looking at him that he was unfit, not fully recovered from the malaria, and well off the pace.  In the week before that match, I believe I had a lengthy debate with Smokey over whether Soldado or Kane should start against West Ham (for the record, I was pushing for Kane).  That Ade might actually start didn't even seem remotely possible, until match day when -- voila! -- there he was.

As I said, I like our coach, I like where the team is at the moment, I like what he's building, and feel good about the future.  And for a young team especially, emphasizing training and attitude is a good thing.  But I absolutely do not think he has given every player a fair opportunity in matches.

I don't think any of it should be 'legal' in the traditional sense that you get off Scott free for doing it. Selling should be illegal full stop but it's clear prison is neither harsh enough to equal actual punishment (ie, it's not a strong enough deterrent to those who are already criminals. One of the reasons I don't punch someone being ignorant in public is because I'd likely lose my job etc. to criminals, that doesn't matter so much). Buying for personal use, whatever. Buying for others or buying enough to indicate further sale should be dealt with in the same way as selling. The 'war' on drugs could be dealt with a million ways but they're all unpredictable. It isn't as simple as legalise this or decriminalise that. Drug use and particularly sale by organised criminals is a problem that needs to be solved. Is prison doing that? Clearly not. We need to investigate why that is, not blindly shooting in the dark hoping to solve a problem by making it worse.

However, I don't think we should just ignore buyers either. They have a problem, clearly. Whether they or others want to admit it; addiction of any description is a problem. Buying should be met with an offer of some sort of educational course of some sort but it's all case by case. If someone refuses education or aid to stop then that should go on record perhaps two offers or a three strikes an out system. After that, they are out of society's hands. I believe strongly in second chances, we err. We're all human. But if one consistently makes poor choices in light of aid being offered and refused then society shouldn't waste it's time.  Money is a finite resource after all. 

The problem comes when we put this in the hands of a government who's sole intention currently appears to be 'cutting the deficit'. That's cool but it doesn't solve the rampant problems this country is actually facing. If imposed, addiction management would be mismanaged to the nth degree by inept public officials, a minister who knows nothing and ignores advice and unwilling participants who turn up just to get a legal hit after they learn all the loopholes.",null,0,null,1440048353,null,null,1440051942,0,cu96wmd,null,t3_3hkj64,null,null,null,t1_cu8ve3i,null,null,null,1441359068,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Second, if by ""breaking into the top 4"" you meant becoming an *established* top 4 team, then my point still stands.  The resources of the consistent top 4 teams are much greater than ours, and are precisely why we've been able to reach the top 4 merely occasionally, but not stay there.  And that will continue to be the case until we open up substantial new flows of revenue.  Levy has basically said as much.  I'm annoyed that we signed a Pienaar or Saha and but didn't sign someone like Coutinho, and I think Levy has been penny-wise and pound-foolish in these and other cases, but signing one or another of them would not have been enough to make us a *consistent* top 4 club.

Third, if you are going to include Parker in the ""near world class"" category, then maybe you should be clearer about what your criteria are for what players we should or should not be looking at.

Fourth, if you accept our former RAF captain as a good signing, than how exactly do you disagree with /u/yourfriendkyle?  He said 

&gt;He's an experienced international who has performed very well in the premier league and at the world cup. Our young midfield would learn lots from his professionalism and hard working attitude. 

And you said that such a mindset is why we haven't been able to break into the top 4, but actually that mindset got us Parker, who was a big part of what *did* get us into the top 4 in 2011/12 (and should have gotten us into the top 3, had Harry Redknapp been focusing on his actual job rather than his prospective job).

* ""The Runaway Bride"" stands as ""the new Tennant's Doctor"" to me. The episode explains very well the new ""statement"": he's lost, and he just runs without purpose. He just ""keep existing"", and that's it. Also, he starts to be darker about the fact that, well, he's probably the most powerful guy in the universe but he still couldn't prevent what happened with Rose.
* in ""Daleks in Manhattan"", you can also see that this Doctor is almost becoming suicidal: he just runs in front of the Daleks without any plan or anything, just like ""shoot me"" or I don't remember what he says, but basically I think this is an important point in Tennant's Doctor development. 
* to me, the Master gives him back some purpose, because the doctor has a glimpse at ""what could happen if he lost his mind""; but seeing that, he goes a step further in what will bring him to...
* Waters of Mars! That's the step where he knows that he shouldn't keep going that way, that he's going *wrong*.

Theres bound to be some errors in here and i did ramble  in some areas but its late and i will reread tomorrow morn



&gt; I'm not calling Pochettino terrible for failing to get 4th place, but I am calling him out for what was a pretty underwhelming season. 

I really dont see how last season was underwhelming. Our club was basically in shambles when he took over. The atmosphere was horrid, the players and the team felt soulless compared to now. Pochettino put a stiffer backbone in the squad and made the team work hard every game. Not to mention getting to a cup final which AVB failed to do.  Sure the first couple months of the season were tough and required some late heroics but better we still came away with those results as opposed to losing those games. However, the performance leading up the new years thrashing of chelsea were anything short of underwhelming. They were not simply Harry Kane scoring the goals, although he did, but it was a cohesive tactical and overall team domination. The performances against chelsea and arsenal were down to the execution of pochs pressing system not only Harry Kane being the player he is. Of course there were stumbling blocks along the way as there is with any mew manager. On the note of no plan b, you could  argue that it is more important in the long term, to sacrifice some results in his first season when he has more leeway and stick to his plan A so the player can learn it, instead of changing his tactics mid game, thus not allowing the players to experience different situations under his system. 

&gt; His first season was worse than AVB's first season, and both were built on an over-reliance on one world class player to get more than a third of our points single-handedly. Should Kane fail to fire anywhere near the same to last season, it would honestly not surprise me to see Poch defending his job come January. That's not me calling for his head... it's simply based on Levy's previous form with managers.

I cant really see the argument that pochettino's first season was  worse than AVBs.  As good as Kane's goal scoring numbers are, he does not have the individual skill that bale possesses. Bale won games single handedly. Kane doesnt have the ability to score the goals bale scored against West ham, southhampton, and sunderland. Alhough Kane's goals were decisive, the games were still excellent team performances. point being, if Poch had Bale, im sure he would have done just as good as AVBs first year. 

&gt; despite finishing 5th (not 6th by the way)

When i said we finished 6th i was referring to the 2013-14 season, the season before poch took over. Everton finished above us. So poch took us from 6th to 5th in his first season.

&gt; I'm sure Capoue fucked up to get what happened to him, but what would you rather... an unyielding disciplinarian who puts principles before points, or someone who's willing to work on a more personal level with the hand he's actually been dealt, working on the psychology of the needier players in the squad until he gets something useful out of them?


Poch is known to work his players hard. He builds a meritocracy around his squad. You work hard, you perform, you play. How do you think all these young players flew into the first team? Surely, pochettino's ability to work with them one on one was an integral part to their success. All the players in the squad have always said positive things about what the manager does for them and the ideas he wants to instill in the club. Ryan Mason has said something along the lines that, ""the manager beleived in me and gave me a chance"" Thats good man management to me. Believing in your younger players. Like you mentioned, management isnt binary, and to say, poch hasnt worked out any differences with players who are within the squad isnt fair either. There is really no way of knowing. IM sure it took some man management to get eriksen to run all those miles every game. So to say that he froze out capoue does not  mean he has no man management skills. Just because a manager has to fire one employee, it doesnt mean they are bad at man management. Sometimes things dont work out. Also its one thing to rate Capoue but after not getting a look in with three separate managers, i think there is an issue with the player there.  On the note of having strict principles, thats the whole point of starting to back a manager and allowing for a cohesive side. Im sure Capoue was fine on a personal level, He probably just didnt want to run 12km every match. A player can still not suit a system and still be emotionally stable if thats what your were getting at. 

Here is an article explaining poch's training methods and how the players actually like him and talk about how pochettino gave them self belief (see Jay Rodriguez;s quotes). Again, good man management. 
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2722193/Mauricio-Pochettino-Tottenham-stars-triple-training-walk-hot-coals-His-methods-pay-players-say-He-works-like-dog-You-want-kill-him.html

As I dont have 13 years in the film industry I cant shed light upon the comparisons. However, i will say you mention finding out a players strengths and therefore knowing their weaknesses. If capoue's weaknesses are not running and not pressing as instructed, he wont play because he will ruin the whole system and the other player's effort. If you had a co-worker who was continually not performing the instructions he was given and therefore causing your entire team to suffer, you would slowly look to remove him from your team in the long run if his behavior didnt change. With Capoue, after 3 seasons, it looks like there was an issue that meant he was never going to stay as a squad member consistently in a top 6 side.

With a Defined Contribution pension - which most people have - your contributions are invested. The value of that investment can fall. 

With defined benefit, you know *exactly* what you're getting. 

After one year of work, you will have a guaranteed pension of £473 per year from the day you retire until the day you die. The sum will increase with inflation.

If you work 20 years at £30k per year,  that's a guaranteed pension of £9,500 per year. 

Two important things to look at. 

1. Can you buy extra years? This is usually called AVC (Additional Voluntary Contributions) and can boost the pension by a fair bit. 

2. What other benefits do you get? For example many defined benefits schemes have a death in service payout, will you be able to take some of the pension as a lump sum, can you transfer it to other pension schemes? 

So, yes, it's still a *really* good deal. If you decided not to participate you would not be able to get anywhere close to that rate of return with the extra money in your paycheque.

Graduated in 2010 and started to work part-time in my old primary school while waiting for next year's intake on a PGCE course.  Whilst at the primary school and reading more about the PGCE decided that teaching children in a state school definitely wasn't for me. But I liked the teaching side.

Swapped the PGCE for a CELTA course and finished that in the summer of 2011. Autumn 2011 went to China to teach at a university for 2 years and loved it. Returned to the UK in 2013 and did an MA in English language teaching.  Finished that in summer of 2014 and went back to China in the autumn. 

I can't say a history degree specifically helped me to get where I am now, but it didn't hurt.  I never knew about the 'English language teaching' profession until I was handing in my history dissertation and saw a poster on the wall from some company in China.  

Now I work 2 days a week, get a rent-free apartment, return flights twice a year, and 20 weeks of holiday (paid) per year.  I also work in the UK during the summer on pre-sessional courses (teaching English to international students who haven't quite got the English language skills necessary for studying in the UK) and net around 6k for 6 weeks of work.

null,null,benefitsthrowaway123,null,null,null,"Hmm. I think most people involved with benefits would agree that UC is a good idea. It makes sense for people to only have one port of call. It also makes it infinitely easier for people to get part time work - they don't have to be signing on/off constantly, just need to tell UC and their requirements will be adjusted to reflect their current work. Plus, people's wages are automatically taken into account vs UC from 99% of employers, as almost all are required by law to report to HMRC's real time information system, which passes the info directly to UC, so people don't have the hassle of reporting every 20 quid they earn. 

The only question is implementation, and it certainly more complex to administer the benefit, given that it's replaces JSA, ESA. Housing benefit, Working tax, child tax, etc. As with any large project there are teething problems, but it's generally agreed that the government is too far along to consider anything but full steam ahead with UC. 

In terms of applying its fairly simple I suppose. Go online, fill a form in, get a phone call within 2 working days with an appointment. Attend appointment with evidence of ID/any other relevant stuff, and your claim is up and running. Only problem there though is that it's such a long wait to get payment started. It's 5 weeks at minimum, and 6 in the majority of new claims. So that's up 6 weeks people are expected to go without money. People can have an advance of UC (advance is not means tested) up to 50% of their initial monthly amount (repaid over up to 6 months) but it's still a very long time to wait on not much money.

On terms of UC sanctions, they are less harsh than JSA sanctions in that the first ""fixed penalty"" for missing an appointment is 7 days not a month, 2nd missed appt is 14, 3rd 28, so it's a bit more lenient in that regard. Anything past the low level sanctions though it's the same.

All in all it's a more advanced and on balance a better system, but it is very difficult to get right given the balance between this massive rollout, demands on IT and staff,.

For me, Neville seemed spot on a suited for the job really well, whereas you listen to Carragher and you can tell he knows his shit, he just has trouble converting the thoughts into the touch system. He's not suited for the role of technology in modern commentary. Would've made a lot more sense to put a host of filler type person there controlling a larger screen they all stood in front of which he could then point and describe, more similar to a film session. 

Just my two cents, you have great analysts, play to Carragher knowledge like you do to Neville's. 

And as far as their actual discussion, my personal opinion is that the way in which Fabregas is used opens up Magic and thus Terry and the backline to those counters. It's taboo to talk about how Cesc has been playing, but in everything I've seen his last 15 games as a blue have been awful, the clear cut passing isn't there, and if he doesn't offer anything tracking back except for a yellow or hard foul to stop a break, Mou is wasting his talent and place out there.

Adding Pedro really opens up potentially dropping back Willian into Cescs role and allowing him to get forward like he does, but with the comfort of knowing he will create and have the ability to track back on the ball if its turned over.

But then that's marred by the 150%-or-so increase in thicker, heavier 'bags for life'.

For the £3.5m/year raised, the Welsh Government has managed to reduce the consumption of carrier bag by just 2,000 tonnes. So for *all* of Wales, they've managed to reduce their waste by three bin-lorries a week - or around 0.1% of the waste generated.

But it's still a good start though, right? No, it's not. If they were going for *litter* reduction, all the stats pointed at cigarette boxes, takeaway/food boxes and cans as the biggest culprits (bags make up a tiny share of litter found by Keep Wales Tidy by item).

Sorry, I misspoke too ... now edited.  I didn't mean to compare Saha/Pienaar to Parker or Rafa.   Quite the opposite in fact!  As I said, Levy can be penny-wise and pound-foolish at times.

Fair enough, you don't want to bring in an experienced player as a stop-gap or to plug a hole.  I don't know that I totally agree, but that's fine.  I think you might be overstating Parker's quality -- he was good, but he wasn't in Rafa's class.  But it's a different equation in central midfield than in attacking midfield or striker (a la Pienaar or Saha).  At CM, especially CDM, simply being solid is a quality of its own.

I used to be a band C and acting band D at times and had over a year working as a sanctions specialist and what you did is covered by regulations that allow you to treat such cases as straightforward. 
There is a space on one of the es567 (or similar) form that is the same size as an LMU, that covers each of those situations. 
Some managers in my office were trying to make it so that only a band C could make that call in the office when I left dwp but there is nothing in regulations that supports that and any band B can and should be making those decisions as they are employment officers as defined by the acts and regulations and that is clearly in guidance part of your job as a band B. 

Your general point about most dwp staff being decent people and not looking to stop people's money though is true and definitely ties with my experience. 
I took the sanctions specialist role specifically cos I knew regs well enough to both make sure innocent people were not getting screwed by ignorance, manager greed for stats, and customers not knowing how to deal with the system. 

I spent as much time helping people avoid sanctions who didn't deserve them or overturning them when it was a bad call as I did actually stopping the money of people who had repeatedly demonstrated they took the piss (about 3 percent of all dwp customers tops.) 

I must say though that /u/fuck_the_dwp looks to me suspicious as fuck from my experience of literally thousands of sanctions situations and people should not be donating money to him/her. 
They might be legit, they might not, but there are enough holes and omissions and shaky responses that make me skeptical as to how innocent they are and I've known a lot of people who will play any trick for sympathy or guilt or manipulation in sanction situations too. 

The vast majority of people are genuine, don't deserve sanctions and mostly don't get them. 

There are a whole set of innocently sanctioned people too due to various crap factors, but for most job centres and most sanctions there is a degree of justification. 

As you have pointed out most staff hate giving sanctions so purely on the balance of odds if this kid has been they are more likely to be guilty than innocent even before you see the particulars of the case. 
The system as written is fair, in terms of determining guilt, even if the understaffed under trained  implementation is sometimes not. 
I don't agree with the length of the punishments, but I know that the determination of guilt has a system behind it that when applied properly any normal redditor would think is fair. 

It is massively complex unfortunately because there are so many special cases and a mess of legislation behind it,and that can make it hard to administer fairly, but my experience across many hundred of staff members including training them and dealing with stats at regional level makes me confident that **mostly** dwp is fair in who it sanctions even if I disagree with the sentencing length politics that came in I'm 2012. 

Add on top of that all the stuff they have said and my alarm bells are massively going off about this person.

Did you not make them aware of your presence when you first showed up for the appointment? I remember when I was on the dole I had to show my little id slip when I first showed up.

Have you tried applying for an emergency loan from the job centre? I know it sounds counterintuitive but they might give you some money if the situation is that bad.

Have you gone to the citizens advice bureau? They might be able to offer you some advice.

Also, instead of stealing from private citizens, you could go and take a look in the bins round the back of your local supermarket. Often a supermarket will simply throw away good food because it is getting close to its sell by date.

- divided (and directly conflicting) accounts and narratives of the past (We should be able to recognise the tragedies and hurt in both communities' accounts of the past, instead of trying to diminish it)
- directly conflicting identities (British, Irish, and Northern Irish identities should not be felt to conflict with each other, but for too many they do)

Then consider that the law also allows you to agree with you Jon centre advisor that you have a permitted period of up to 6 months where you *only* have to look for your old job area before you have to widen your search and you can have up to 12 months where you are permitted to only look at jobs of a similar agreed salary level to what you were on. 
These apply if you have been working in a given job for most of the last two years. 

If there are not enough graduate jobs to give every graduate one in their field, then do you think it is good for the graduate to be allowed a permitted period of 6 to 12 months where they don't have to look for anything else except what they studied? Even if that is something there is very little demand for? 
Is it good economic policy to basically subsidise a few million graduates to make their cv have a massive gap in it? 

Who would an employer at IBM rather employ? The kid who lived on the dole for 6 months trying just to find their job in IT systems or the kid who went out and took a job doing something crap for that same six months and has the same degree as the first one? 

I hate the dwp myself, and I worked for them for 4 years but the amount of response that is ill thought out and reactionary on this thread is amazing.

Lallana was really good in preseason when he had time but what I'm kinda trying to say is against Arsenal we won't HAVE time, which is why I feel a more rapid player like Ibe would be a better fit.

My XI would be more like this, although it won't be this.

------------------Mignolet-------------------

------Clyne---Skrtel---Lovren---Gomez------

----------------Milner----Can-----------------

----Ibe-----------Coutinho---------Moreno----------

-------------------Benteke-------------------

I wouldn't start Lucas. I'm a MASSIVE fan of his, but he'll just give a way 'tactical' fouls allowing Ozil, Sanchez etc to put balls in the box. Milner is a more dynamic player who will fight harder to win the ball without drawing the foul. 

This would be a great game to play Coutinho in his favoured attacking mid spot as, assuming we will be countering, he bursts at pace and can play through the widemen or Bentekkers.

You'll think I'm ridiculous for putting Moreno in as wing , but hear me out. He had a great cameo on Monday and looked twice the player he has been, actually threatening Joe Gomez's spot. However, due to his attacking prowess, I feel he should be higher up the field especially against good opposition like Arsenal. due to the fact Ibe and Moreno are both defensively competent, strong fast lads, we would probably stand a better chance of winning the ball back before it even enters our half.

Predicting a 1-1 or a 1-0 either way. Arsenal haven't been great thus far having lost to West Ham, but make no mistake, The Emirates is arguably our hardest ground to play at, and if we've learnt anything it's that a good defensive set up should allow the attackers to do their thing. We're well capable of a win, but whether or not we get one is a different story.

Be aware though, South-East England is a very crowded area. There are some 12-14 million people living in an area not much bigger than the state of Delaware making much same sort of trade-off you're trying, and there aren't any secret hidden areas known only to a few. 

The way to optimize is to look at things that might matter to other people but not to you, for example some people care about good schools, if you don't have kids that's not a factor. (That said, the factors of ""nice place to live"" tend to correlate, so it's still not a very big win).

If you can tolerate longer commute times, then looking further out from the immediate ring of ""commuter towns"" is becoming a bit more popular. For example, there are trains from Northampton and Huntingdon to London that take about an hour. Obviously you've got the time to get to the station, and then the time to commute across London to where you want to be on top of that. That sort of life means three hours or more commuting per day, and isn't for everybody, but at least you stand a chance of getting a seat on the train and being able to work, read or sleep.

Also, [factor in commuting costs](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/seasonticket/search). Peak time trains into London are extremely expensive, and very crowded. To arbitrarily pick one typical ""commuter town"", Guildford to London is £4,204 for an annual season ticket. The further-out options I mentioned are a little more, Northampton to London is £6,180. (Those include tube travel, it's a bit cheaper as well as less time if you work near a station you can get straight to.)

Each year every council sets the Council Tax for their area. These can generally be found on the relevant council's website.  All properties in the same band in the same council area pay the same basic amount before any discounts or other modifications.  Property listings will typically mentions the banding of the property (e.g. ""Council Tax band B"") so if you know which council it's in you can work out how much you'll pay.

If you are the only eligible adult in the property you can claim a single person discount of 25%.  There are also various other discounts and exemptions available; e.g. full time students are exempt, and people on low incomes can receive discounts.

In respect of segregated education however, it is us the taxpayer that funds it. We, collectively, do actually have the ability to rip up the rules books on how we educate our kids, and start again. Its our money and we have the power to decide how it should be spent.

So orange order and segregated education are not directly comparable entitities. One is a sub contracted agency of Government responsibility. The other is an organisation that people join and partake in during their individual leisure time.

More directly to your question though, yes I hope the GAA will change too. Actually clamp down on clubs naming medals, tournaments and themselves after sectarian terrorists and consider whether it really is necessary to play the Irish national anthem and fly the Irish tricolour at games in Northern Ireland (or even just momentarily ponder whether these things make the game less or more attractive to under-represented communities in the sport - is it a sport or a political organisation?)

I hope loyalist flute bands will wise up their behaviour (and the orange order ban those that don't from parades) and equally stop naming themselves after paramilitaries. I hope the courage can summoned by the police, politicians and the community themselves to stop the burning of tricolours and effigies on loyalist bonfires (and internment bonfires for that matter too).

I hope community leadership can bring down peace walls. I hope an environment can be produced that will return us to some of the mixed housing areas we had before the late 60s, and better.

But on all these things, I can merely hope. Its the politicians we elect who can actually give the leadership to make the change happen.

null,null,BreakingAverage,null,null,null,"The two things you're trying to compare are notoriously difficult due to:  
• assumptions you'll need to make about investment returns, life expectancy, wage inflation and your own circumstances (married? Dependants?)  
• competitive cost of securing equivalent benefits on retirement (namely the cost of an equivalent annuity which will depend on financial markets - such as the yields available on government bonds, prevailing legislation and market forces like competition)  
• the actual specifics of the scheme defined in the governing documentation (scheme rules) and pensions legislation

To this properly (but even then not conclusively) you'll need an actuarial model. You have my sympathy for not being able to see which offers a best return for your contributions!

In addition, as the benefit nature is defined up front, what might offer the best return in terms of value might not be the best individual option for you. Simple example: if you're not married and don't expect to live for a long period after retirement due to a known medical condition - you might be significantly better off opting for a defined contribution arrangement.

However I echo what others have suggested. This is a defined benefit arrangement which will give a great deal of certainty for your retirement benefit provision - all the risks such as investment and longevity (living longer than anticipated) will be with the pension plan and not you. The cost of such provision (in my experience) is substantially more than 6% PA - and more like 20+%pa overall. They are not common arrangements for employees any more because of the cost and the risk. Those that do exist tend to have complicated rules (like those described for career average earnings and retirement age) in an attempt to make them more affordable and reduce the risk to the sponsor. However in my opinion they are still good value.

One last point (noting I don't have the specific details) is that the spouses pension is highly unlikely to be ""half the value"" of the pension (with half being lost). If you die a pension might be payable to a spouse which is half of the amount you had accrued to the point you died - but this is by no means half the value. This is a pension payable to them until they die. If you die at a relatively young age, this pension could be in payment for 50+ years! Think about that - 50 years of payments rather than your life expectancy from retirement (25?)",null,0,null,1440058743,null,null,false,0,cu9a1nd,null,t3_3hmwx6,null,null,null,t3_3hmwx6,null,null,null,1441360549,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

One last nugget of advise that may be useful is try to ride in all weather, often. The day when you start your ride on a lovely clear, sunny vista and then by the end visibility is nil and the rain has managed to pool in your boots is the day you wish you had more wet weather experience. It's something that catches out riders *a lot* - not many riders ride all year round, in all weather. That's fair enough, I can completely understand why, but they do limit their exposure to adverse conditions by doing that.

I rode through the winter last year, through ice/snow/sleet and my Mod2 test was would you believe it - in February, in the snow! I passed with 4 minors. I don't think for a minute I would have done if I hadn't ridden on my 125 in those conditions beforehand - it gave me a huge confidence boost and a lot of valuable feathers to my proverbial cap!

Riding in bad weather can be a huge confidence boost. If you can ride safely and to a good, safe standard in the wet then you can almost certainly ride well in the dry. Test yourself, constantly strive to improve your riding and you'll be a sterling rider before you know it.

null,null,DaveChild,null,null,null,"&gt; You said that its not ok that he was incorrectly sanctioned, but your post basically said its ok that we punish legitimate people in pursuit of fraudulent claims

No, it didn't. It *explicitly* said the opposite. I believe it is inevitable that in a system that is designed to prevent fraud, that you will have false positives. I didn't say we should just say ""oh well, never mind"", give the finger to those false positives and move on - I think we should keep trying to improve systems like that to reduce those false positives, to reduce the cost of fraud prevention. 

&gt; Of course there is a balance

It is entirely a balance - that's what I'm saying. That is my entire point. On one hand is a need for trying to reduce fraudulent claiming and to keep costs down, on the other is a large number of people in need of financial support. If you want a system where what happened to /u/Fuck_the_DWP never happens to anyone, that costs more than what we have now. 

Are you up for paying more in to the system for that? What level of false positive are you OK with? Can you live with one person a year being unfairly sanctioned? Ten? 0.1% of claimants? 1%? What's an unacceptable number to you? Is the current system performing better or worse than that number?

&gt;  someone who is blatantly abusing the system should be kicked off it

Spoken like someone with only a distant connection to reality. People who are abusing the system aren't wandering around with a neon sign over their heads saying ""har har, I got your moneys"". The *only* point at which the DWP actually interacts with claimants is the appointments, at which they have limited time and information. 

&gt; Missing an appointment is a very poor metric for this, and the punishment for it is very ridiculous.

Well, no, not really. If you're unemployed and looking for work, an appointment every two weeks is not hard to make it to. The appointments serve several purposes - to check people are actually looking for work, which is a condition on which they are given the jobseeker's allowance, and to make it more difficult for people who are actually in work to claim.

null,null,AmbiguousP,null,null,null,"I have several issues with your assertions in that comment.

&gt; Equality is by definition inclusive of all groups, there are of course issues that just affect women where they suffer from inequality, but equally there are issues that affect men where women are given preferential treatment (i.e. child custody, divorce settlements, severity of convictions for the same crime etc.)

&gt;Calling it ""Women's Equality"" is disingenuous as you can't have women equal to men without men being equal to women, even if all women were given equal treatment in places where they experience inequality, that still wouldn't achieve women's equality because they'd still get preferential treatment in other areas.

While it's true that equality as a whole can include all groups, in this context the word is not being used to refer to the totality of the concept that is ""Equality"". Instead, it refers only to those issues which adversely affect women. (Similarly, the Equal Rights movement in the USA did not seek general equality of rights, but certain specific equalities of rights regarding race. This doesn't mean that their name is ""incorrect"", just that there is more than one sense of ""equal rights""). 

Also, with regards to your comments on the disadvantages unique to men in our society, I am personally of the view that they are generally a product of broader discrimination and inequality for women (but that's a discussion for another time probably).

&gt; Also calling it women's equality leaves out the most vulnerable group which is the transgendered community who experience way more prejudice and discrimination than either of the other two.

I'm particularly uncomfortable with this statement, as it assumes that ""women"" excludes transgender individuals. This is not the case. Transwomen are women, and intersectionality is a huge part of modern feminism and other equality movements. While there are a huge number of issues unique to transpeople, there's nothing at all in ""Women's Equality"" which implies an exclusion of transwomen. Obviously we then have the issue that transmen are left outside of that label, but the issues addressed by women's equality regarding transwomen are also likely to help transmen (just as the issues addressed regarding women in general are likely to help men in general). 

Also, again, there is nothing about women (or more specifically transwomen) receiving support which reduces the support available to men or transmen. A reduction in discrimination against women, or an improvement in the acceptance of transwomen, *does not take anything away from transmen or men in general*.

&gt; To summarise, there's nothing inherently wrong with making a political group advocating for women's rights or trying to make progress with women's issues, I just find the naming ""women's equality"" a little sexist. By all means call it the ""Women's Issues Party"" or something of that kin.

I'm not sure how ""women's equality"" could be considered sexist, even given what you have said above. I know I'm saying it again and again, but *improving things for women does not mean making things worse for anyone else*. 

Also, the fundamental point behind this movement and the party is that women in our society are *not* equal to men - they are seriously disadvantaged. While there may be individual issues where men are at a disadvantage (and again, I consider most of the possible cases of this to be a product of sexism against women), looking at society as a whole women *are less equal*. Why should we shy away from calling a movement to correct this ""Women's Equality""? To call the party ""Women's Issues"" would immediately diminish the importance of the work to be done by implying that there is no specific disadvantage faced by women, only ""issues"".

Firstly, if your example is meant as a comparator to the north belfast situation, I suppose a pro pope march starting from the short strand and running to the centre of Belfast via the lower newtownards road would be the fairer analogy. Its not like the Orange Order are demanding to march the length of the Falls Road are they? Rather they're going near (not even through) a politicised nationalist area on the way back to their lodge, or wherever it is they're trying to get to (If you're super insistent on debating the rights and wrongs of the orange order you'd really be better finding someone else to debate with. I'm not in it, nor any particular fervent apologist for them).

So anyway, with that new analogy in place, would I support it?

As an atheist, I can't say I think the Pope is the greatest person in the world (nor should anyone else who cares about Aids and HIV infection and over-population in the developing world, gay rights equality, or the protection of children from sexual abuse), so I can't say I'd be joining the march myself.

Would I support their right to free and lawful assembly though?

As a libertarian, yes, absolutely.

What we should be building is a society where people are comfortable with their neighbours having differing identities and beliefs to their own, and noone feels any particular need to rush out and provoke their neighbours on these issues. 

What we shouldn't be building is a society where the police and legal authorities are mandated to crack down on the slightest event that a residents group or paramilitary commander might decide is 'offensive' to them.

SHIT, do something now!

&gt; No other developed economy in the world is seeing a similar social trend as they typically see rural to urban migration, the ministers say. 

Notice how the telegraph is *literally* incapable of giving figures regarding rural to urban migration as if it never happens. No numbers, just a vague notion that something needs to be done. No notion of statistical significance or natural variation in numbers. No discussion of geographical data. Just parroting the governments line like a fucking mouth piece for the conservative party.

And that something is....

Another state subsidised mortgage scheme, to keep the property bubble going with lots and lots of affordable housing.
Hooray!

&gt; The ministers attack Labour’s failure to prioritise rural areas when in office, saying that the party “has never understood the millions of people who live in the countryside, or even pretended to be interested in them”.

There has been a culture change in management priorities, and there is a lot more time spent pushing for more sanctions generally, however targets do not exist.
DWP front line staff are massively unionised (like more than 80 percent in most job centres are union members) and mostly quite left wing, so as well as *most* staff pushing back against this culture change a lot, if there was something deeply legally unfair going on, there would be whistleblowers all over the place.
Every time someone signs on they are reminded about the rules and the consequences for breaking them and 94% of customers are never expected to get a sanction. 
It is actually quite hard for a sanction to stick, so the idea that people are getting punished who don't deserve it en masse is actually left wing propaganda (and I say this as a left wing minded person myself.)

Sure there are cases of injustice in the DWP, the way they have gone about the health benefits reform is scandalous. 

I also agree that 13 weeks is unreasonable for a second offence and 4 weeks is too much for a first offence, but thats the only substantial change the tories have actually made to the JSA rules, most of the sanctions rules have been around a long time before they got into power, they are just actually trying to make the left wing majority of their staff actually apply them as designed.
The fact that job centres are massively understaffed and undertrained to do their jobs and obviously a small minority of petty bullying advisors who exist purely as a power trip to their own egos does mean there will be some people unfairly stopped, and that is absolutely unfair, but it is also not the majority of people who get sanctions by a long way.

Most people who get a second offence sanction and it sticks, have usually done exactly what they should not have done, promised repeatedly they would not do, signed a contract when they made a claim that says in comprehensible english that they would not to, received an information booklet that explains the consequences if they do it, have signed on every two weeks and been reminded at dozens of face to face meetings that they should not do this, and have been given multiple chances to justify and explain when they do break the rules, and get as well as an initial defence, 2 chances to appeal for every single infraction, have the right to a full verbal explanation or written explanation, and a metric shit tonne of information on this stuff given to them at every stage of the process.

The Tories WANT the left wing to be preoccupied fighting the bullshit narrative about benefit claimants and sanctions levels and numbers and shit like this, whilst they laugh about how the rich continuously steal the vast majority of the economy from the masses.

I hate the DWP, I hate sanctions and I have had friends that have had to suffer these things and it is just shit.  However:

1) My first issue is that I think that we are not being told the whole story.  Missing 1 meeting, with a plausible excuse, rarely results in a 13 week sanction.  Maybe a 2 week sanction if you are unlucky.  So I am thinking that the OP is not telling 100% of all that went down that day.

2) You say you appealed and that is fine and dandy, it was rejected... but why did you not then take this further?  Here is a link to a service which outlines the appeals process:

http://z2k.org/free-help-advice/appealing-benefit-sanctions/

If you appealed to the DWP and they rejected you then you go forward to an independent Tribunal.  Your sanction is put on hold pending this appeal.  If you went to the Tribunals Service (again INDEPENDENT) and they upheld the DWP stance it then feeds into the idea that maybe this was about more than simply missing one appointment.  If you have not been to the Tribunals Service then you should go. If the circumstances are as you say they are you will win and your benefits will be back paid.

3) ""Im quickly approaching my fourth week and rather than begging which I'm not cut out for I'm trying to build up the courage to go out stealing.""

What?  

In a three week period you have arrived at here.  Maybe if this were a less caring society I would be appalled in the sense that I would think that the government were bastards.  Except you are surrounded by organisations that are here to help you that you have not accessed... here are a few:

1) Food banks.

http://www.trusselltrust.org/foodbank-projects

http://gingerbread.org.uk/content/2116/How-to-get-financial-help-in-an-emergency?gclid=CLnSktClt8cCFUFmGwod95QNOA

Surely being given food is better than begging or stealing?  You can access a food bank directly or you can be referred.

2) Emergency funding.

Every local authority will have a crisis fund that they will be able to make cash payments directly to you or your bank account.  For example here is the information for Barnet's emergency fund (I do not live in Barnet and I do not know where OP lives).

https://www.barnet.gov.uk/citizen-home/council-tax-and-benefits/grants-and-funding/barnet-crisis-fund.html

Beyond your local council crisis fund there will also be funding available through private charities and organisations... Organisations like Turn2us, there will be others as well... Google is your friend and I recommend, before you go stealing, maybe a trip to your local CAB:

https://www.turn2us.org.uk/

In addition to the crisis funding route the DWP will give you money, it will be in the form of a loan and it will be repaid through future benefit payments (which is shite, but at least it gets you through this moment).

I am sorry that you have been sanctioned, and I am sorry that you are having a tough time.  But you are tech savvy enough to come to Reddit and write this article... you should also be savvy enough to know that you are far from the last resort.  You can fight the appeal, you will even be supported by local government and charitible organisations, enough so that you do not have to be sent money by other people, beg or, even, go stealing.",null,0,null,1440061648,null,null,false,0,cu9aqec,null,t3_3hk8r5,null,null,null,t1_cu85pkk,null,null,null,1441360871,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Aside from his technique, his value is on the speed of his play - he can anticipate two or three passes ahead, like that Schurrle goal against Burnley.

When he's not mentally sharp, his game really suffers. He's always been slow, but he looks a little jaded these days. He's lacking a little bit of sharpness, I would hope that can be remedied soon. 

Let's not forget Fabregas was so good as a false 9 in the Euro 2012 he kept Torres out of the starting side.

null,null,DaveChild,null,null,null,"&gt; And if that means paying something to people even when they’re fucking up, no matter how hard they try? Yes, I’m OK with that; I think it’s worth it.

I tend to agree. I'm a big fan of basic income or guaranteed minimum income systems for that reason. Also because those systems don't have to worry about fraud prevention, which means more taxpayer money can be spent better.

&gt; If large portions of society were deliberately and comfortably living on the dole, and others were suffering economically because of it — then, yes, that would be too much “something for nothing”. But we’re nowhere near that situation at the moment.

That's true. It wasn't long ago people would go and claim unemployment on a friday, then stop claiming monday morning. The system has improved over a long time, and now fraudulent claiming is harder than ever. But with all those new rules come more opportunities for genuine claimants to be wrongly treated as fraudulent.

I suspect you might have it backwards a little - we don't have large portions of society deliberately and comfortably living on the dole *because* there is a system in place to try to ensure only those in genuine need are able to claim. I don't know figures, so I could be wrong, but what you said sounds a lot like ""we don't need this shark cage because nobody in here has been bitten by a shark"".

&gt;  I don’t think the people in charge are deliberately out to get the poor. But they are being pretty callous about the suffering it causes directly among the poor, and also very short-sighted about the long-term effects on society.

I don't know what else you'd want from the government. They're not individually going in to job centres and going ""fuck that guy over there"", they're setting broad rules to try to make the system better. I don't think they should be attacked as much as they are for that effort. 

&gt; very short-sighted about the long-term effects on society.

I think you're right. It's unfortunate that our system is so susceptible to short-term thinking. Politicians are probably in a difficult spot. I'd imagine many of them have radical, maybe even brilliant, ideas for improving the system.

null,null,calculusprime,null,null,null,"&gt; Do state sector schools teach Irish language, Irish culture, Irish history, Irish geography or play Gaelic games? 

Again this is somewhat the point. Our current divided education system, surprise surprise, every year churns out thousands of individuals with divided identities. Some with a keen sense of their Irishness (the history, culture, language and sports you mention above), others with a stronger sense of British and Northern Irish identities. Like a sick reality tv gameshow, lets see how that all works out as the two sets of differently programmed kids interact (or don't, more to the point) wth each other through the rest of their adult lives.

Is it really in the dimensions of unearthly radicalism to suggest Irish history, British history and Northern Irish history could be taught in a single education system? That kids might be allowed to choose between playing GAA, cricket, or rugby? That kids could learn Irish and/or Ulster-Scots depending on personal preference (or, heaven forfend, maybe even a language that's useful in the global labour market).

This is a false argument to suggest that without education controlled by the catholic church somehow Irish culture will die on the vine. It wouldn't be a very strong culture if that were the case.

Before the most recent classification by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the practices of Female Genital Cutting were divided into harmless and harmful.  The harmless version was what was known as the “ritual nick”, or “sunna circumcision” (khitān in Arabic).  This is when a small incision is made in the prepuce, the female equivalent of the male’s foreskin.  Medical experts call this as harmless as ear piercing[6], and generally attach no medical benefit or harm to it.  Ironically this is said to be much lighter than the male circumcision[7].  The harmful type of cutting—which the Prophet (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wasallam) incidentally forbade, as well as the consensus of all Islamic jurists—involves removal of parts of the genitals, and is of varying degrees, which leads to a plethora of medical problems especially since they are not normally done in hygienic environments.

null,null,redkitebartek,null,null,null,"Okay so this is a relatively easy thing to do, all you need is some courage when you are planning the move and some persistent  mindset. It really is all about how badly you need or want to move.


First of all, you need to choose your destination, considering your language base any German speaking or English speaking country would be good, as long as you are willing to improve on your english.
Your next step should be going to indeed or reed, to check what possible jobs are there in the area that you might fit with your skill set. Now be honest with yourself, if you really want to get out of Germany, you are willing to move to a place which offers any form of employment that will help you cover the initial living costs.
This means working in a restaurant, cleaning or any other form of employment that in Germany you wouldn't even think about. Even local supermarkets in most of the British towns employ people with just a communicative english as long as they are willing to work. 
Lets sum up, you know where you are going, you got a job prospect or possible places you want to apply when you will be moving. Now make sure you evaluate your budget, how much money you have to spend on rent, how much on food, and what steps you need to follow to make sure you are ""ok"" to cover your initial rent if you don't get a job for a month or longer. There is plenty of work agencies in Europe who contract people to do some short term jobs, look into this as well.

This is sort of your starting plan to get a place abroad then depending on your experience and how well you can sell yourself on interviews and what skills you have you can try to go for a proper job hunt after getting to know the area where you will be living.Oh and I nearly forgot but this is pretty important you should check the living costs of the area you are planning to go to for example living costs in London are very high, but the further from London you go the costs of rent are falling down (but so is the job market, but there are jobs there if you are willing to go below your skill level).
Hope this helped a bit, ask if you need more details etc.  I moved to UK 7 years ago from Poland and I have been working here on the contract ever since 2007.

Both of them have scandals in their past but these have been spread out over many years. Corbyn's equivalent 'mistakes' are now all being racked over at once.

I don't remember Cameron's past being raked over by investigative journalists of the mainstream press in a similar way when he magically rose to rule the roost in the Tory Party?  I'm sure he has plenty of skeletons in his closet and evil people in politics, business and beyond that he honobbed with on his way up the greasy pole.

No you're getting downvoted because you just want to continue the status quo which feeds those human right abusers like the Taliban and cartels. Legalisation of certain drugs based on scientific evidence and produce to set regulated formulas could help reduce and eliminate negative side effects. It would also take money out of organised crime on our streets and abroad.  Reducing the effects of organised crime.

But you'd rather continue with it being illegal due to your moral views towards drugs, thus continue allow money to be funnelled to the very groups you find abhorrent. The war on drugs is lost.

So we got two options:

We continue as we are and keep drugs illegal,  create criminals out of users, have drugs on our streets with no sort of quality control potentially killing people, allow fund to go to organised crime here and abroad and all the negative things that help fuels.

You'd have to make a manual payment each month, adjusting the amount as appropriate, in order to use a SO. With a DD it can take the variable amount out automatically to clear the CC balance.

&gt;As for your example, sure, if you have money in the bank, it won't be available on the credit card

I suspect you don't quite understand the concept I was proposing, as that is the opposite of what I said - the cash balance _would_ be available on the card, in addition to the lending balance, and the overdraft balance. Presently you have a debit and credit system, sometimes with the same bank, sometimes with two banks. I was proposing a product (jokingly) that combines these two features into a single product. The main point being that, your Cash Balance comes before your Lending Limit - making it all the easier to get screwed, but giving real benefits to those with low lending limits but high cash liquidity.

For example (and the numbers are illustrative only);

- [£10 overdraft] [£15 cash balance] [£20 credit limit] = £45 available.

- All your card spending would diminish the cash balance first

- Once exhausted (£15), it would start eating into the Credit balance - this £20 would be due in 30 days

- Once cash+credit exhausted, it eats into your overdraft

- Failing to pay the Credit balance in 30 days, and use of the Overdraft are both perfect opportunities for a bank to charge a fee/interest

- However if in this example you can't get a credit limit beyond £20... the [£15 cash balance + £10 overdraft] lets you use the card longer (by £25) than a normal Credit Card by itself [£20].

&gt;But you're using an unrealistic example.

...lol? You're picking apart the numbers in an example which was used to illustrate the only the functionality? The numbers are completely irrelevant. It could be a £5000 balance with a £30000 lending limit, or a £5 balance and and £50 limit, doesn't matter.

'Ooh, I thought, 'that looks interesting. I didn't realise the Guardian had published an article about the possible winning coalitions. Let me ignore the obvious strawman that no-one's claimed that there is, in fact, only one winning coalition and click on it'.

But no. Seumas has opted for the shittiest internet trick in the world: Make something into a link so that it looks like you have some reason for making this statement even though the link in no way bears out the statement you've made. Like how it's totally official that [Ringo Starr is the greatest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_the_Greatest).

The linked article, in fact, merely discusses the fact that there's no obvious winning coalition at all (although its author still, for some reason, felt the need to cherrypick and misrepresent the evidence to make it seem like Labour has as much of a problem with votes leaking to the left as it does to the right -- it doesn't) not, as Seumas seems to imply, that there are several possibilities of which Corbyn's approach represents one.

In fact, reading the article makes it seem even less likely that Corbyn can win anything as, by all accounts (other than the anecdotal), he appeals mainly to young people and, as the article puts it:

&gt;Even if you were to assume that turnout among young people was nearer to that of the voting population as a whole, and that the new young voters supported Labour in significant numbers, the party would still – all else remaining equal – fall short. That’s because there are only a dozen or so constituencies, such as such as Canterbury and Plymouth Sutton &amp; Devonport, where there are young people in sufficient numbers to make a difference to the outcome.

Great journalism there, Seumas.

North Sea oil is a significant but small proportion of UK GDP. North Sea oil would be a large and significant proportion of Scottish GDP.

North Sea oil is the difference between Scotland being less productive than Yorkshire to being the most productive region outside of London.

That's what its there for. Because these issues are *currently* tricky.

In the society we should be working towards though, it absolutely should go ahead because everyone would be a grown up, and either not be offended and potentially amused (because the Pope's a made up position of authority, like a Grand Dragon or Chief Wizard), or even if they were offended, would show the maturity not to feel this in anyway permitted them to engage in violence.

Sadly we don't live in that world. People in North, East and West Belfast, of both religious backgrounds, weirdly believe that if you're offended, licence is automatically issued upon you to hurl bottles, bricks and worse at your fellow human beings.

That's the shit state of affairs we live in.

If we actually started handing out proper sentences against rioters, did the whole midnight court thing, like London did in 2011, and collectively became adults, then, yeah, why not a pope parade through East Belfast. It shouldn't be seen as anymore provocative than a Monster Raving Looney Party Parade. It makes as much sense.

In short, I'll run with you on this one. I want a Northern Ireland where there's uncontroversial pope parades through East Belfast.

I'll even turn out to have a friendly laugh at the marchers (wave a giant rubber dildo at them or something) if it comes to pass.

But your argument - which appears to be, ""if people find something offensive, ban it"", gives in to the hoody brigade. The hoody brigade are the assholes in this debate. Choosing to be offended does NOT give you licence to violence.

Should gay pride be banned from going past churches because it offends the Ministers and Priests?

 - the Swedish radio public service (especially the 'P3' channel) is on my opinion really high quality. It's aimed at 'young people' but incorporates really good investigatory documentaries as well as pop culture podcasts and comedy. Think radio 1 meets radio 4 - but much more daring. I feel like they are A LOT less sensitive to controversy than the UK equivalents (there's no watershed so you can talk about sex on air without moral outrage). Also, the quality of the music is far better and not segregated into different channels ( you can get everything from 1xtra to radio 6 on the same channel)


- In terms of television I think the BBC is better, as it has better and more high quality content. There's no equivalent to BBC3 in Sweden which I think would make it a bit more approachable. Although the Swedish equivalent of BBC1 &amp; 2 produce a lot of 'high quality content' a lot of people don't watch it as it's considered a bit 'stuffy and serious' and prefer commercial media.  

TL DR; in my very subjective opinion, public service TV is better in Britain, public service radio is better in Sweden.

null,null,Magneto88,TorquayUnited,Torquay United,null,"Bowman played for us last year in the worst team in Torquay's 100 odd year history (well until possibly this year) and managed to get 17 goals. He'll do very well this season. A lot of our fans were quite disappointed he left but with our serious budget cuts this season, we had to sell him to free up salary space to rebuild our team. 

As an aside, although we're one of the traditionally larger sides in the Conference still season, don't expect us to mount much of a challenge, we're going through some pretty bad financial issues at the moment and our playing squad was put together on a shoestring budget. Probably doesn't help we're still paying about £2.5k a week to our old management team, who were signed up on obscenely large contracts by our old incompetent chairwoman, refused to take a wage cut and had to be put on gardening leave. At this level that's about 3/4 quality players that could have made the difference between us challenging for the play-off spots and a boring mid table finish.

I'd be surprised if Kiddie or Aldershot go down, they're fairly decent clubs just going through tough periods atm. Kiddie in particular had a massive cut in their playing budget causing a lot of disruption. You'd want to look more towards the poorly supported semi-pro teams like Bromley, Boreham Wood, Braintree, Welling etc to find the relegation candidates. Only very rarely and usually due to extreme financial issues do the larger clubs tumble out of the Conference Premier. The semi-pro teams tend to flag as the season goes on, they can start well with fresh legs but the disadvantages of not being full time pros, all the travelling, their normal work life often weighs heavy by the time the winter kicks in.

If you're at all familiar with League Two, you'll see a lot to recognise in top of the table Conference matches. There's little difference in quality between the lower half of L2 and the upper third of the Conference. This is why you'll often see the promoted teams doing very well in League Two the following season. Very rarely do they struggle.

null,null,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"Hey, I appreciate the thoughtful response.

I think ultimately we see things differently at this point in time, but that's cool.  I wasn't an enormous fan of Poch's appointment at the time because I didn't particularly want a manager for whom finishing 5th or 6th with Spurs would represent his biggest achievement to date.  de Boer seemingly was a legitimate candidate, and I liked the idea of a guy who had won a shitload as a player and a coach, plus managed a side in the Champions League and played at the very highest tier with Barcelona.  I thought that kind of winning mindset is what the club really needs to kick it up a notch, not drafting in a guy who's done moderately well at little clubs.  But time will tell I guess.

I was completely happy to give Poch the benefit of the doubt, but I just haven't liked the football we've played since he arrived.  The Arsenal and Chelsea wins (which were legitimately great) notwithstanding, I can't say we've looked like a side worthy of 5th place in the EPL, and feel it's far more to do with Liverpool shitting the bed and Everton struggling with Europa than us genuinely looking good.  Southampton played far better football than us for pretty much the entire campaign, and that was also with a new manager and after losing lots of their best players!

In regards to Capoue, we obviously don't know what went down behind closed doors, so probably no point in speculating about who was in the right there.  Although I will say, he didn't piss off three managers... he was actually one of the first names on the team sheet under AVB, then broke his leg.  By the time he was match fit again, Tim ""What's a DM?"" Sherwood was in charge, and so not featuring much in his first season wasn't really his fault.

It's a shame, because to me, Capoue brings all the good points of Mason, with few of the bad.  He gets about the pitch a lot, and had better passing, average length of pass, tackling and interceptions stats than Mason.  He's a different player ultimately, but one I felt the team really needed last year when we were coughing up goals.  With him in the side and functioning at full capacity, I dare say we wouldn't gotten a lot closer to 4th place.

I take your points about him maybe not working hard enough, but again it's one of those situations where I say what's more important - sticking to a strict regime that excludes half your squad, or working out the best way to play with the men at your disposal?  I don't feel Poch has gotten the best out of anyone except Kane, and his supposedly high-press, rigid 4-2-3-1 has only looked the goods in a handful of games up to now.  If his tactics were really paying dividends but only workable with a select few players on the pitch, I'd buy his stance.  But if he's alienating players and not really getting much good football... what then?

Unless we have an unlikely nosedive towards the relegation zone, I don't want him gone this season.  I think two years is enough time to see if his plans are baring fruit however.  I don't particularly mind if we finish 6th this season... I just want a sense that there's some forward momentum with the side.  I'm not particularly feeling it right now.",null,0,null,1440064807,null,null,false,0,cu9bgs3,null,t3_3hl2i6,null,null,null,t1_cu97r93,null,null,null,1441361217,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Not about Mangala and not about Denayer. Apparently we had been talking for quite a few months well under the radar while Utd were openly heavily linked to Otamendi. And when Vinnie performed badly against Stuttgart, it was looking as though Pellers was right to take a tough decision about signing a new centre back. However our captain has had a great start to the season and I don't believe anyone wants Vinnie to go. Lets hope he can keep it up. I haven't been able to find out anything else about recent Mangala and Denayer speculation and what Pellers now thinks about Vinnie but I will in time and I'll let you all know.

I was in a village that's on the edge of a fairly small town by British standards, but actually one of the bigger towns in my county. There were 2-3 buses an hour into the town centre. And another bus an hour which went through the town centre and up to the next town along. 

In my village there was a couple of corner shops, couple of takeaways, couple of pubs and a butchers. |But that's pretty good resources for a village, my boyfriends village has a pub and a butchers. Even if you want some milk and bread, you have to get the car to the nearest town unless you want to be walking all day just for those items! If you like walking and/or cycling in the countryside or activities such as bird watching, then you could cope in the countryside. But there usually isn't much to do. Also, with trains from my home town/village, there's 1 train an hour going north to the nearest city and one train an hour going south the the biggest town in the county. 

But then I moved the a city for university. The supermarket is a 5 minute walk away, buses are every 5 minutes. I can even walk to the high street or beach. There's so much to do in the evenings and there seems to always be some kind of event or festival on during nicer weather. In the city there's trains probably every 5 minutes at least going out of the city, my city is the end of the line but there's another stop in the city that's the very end stop. These are going to two London stations (5 an hour in total going to London) plus Brighton, Southampton, Cardiff and a couple of other places too.

null,null,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),null,"&gt;The reason I say it's unrealistic is because the system you are proposing would only be of any use to people who have cashflow issues

Not precisely. The primary use case is for those with high cash liquidity (for whatever reason) but low lending limits relative to their cash (again, for whatever reason). For example someone on £12k a year salary may struggle to get a Credit Card with a limit of £30k, despite having income from other means or a high cash balance. Such a product would of great use to them.

&gt;That much discetionary spending in a month would suggest you're a relatively wealthy person and would be able to cover the credit anyway.

It isn't about whether something is coverable or not. It is about convenience, opportunities for charging, and solving an issue which doesn't need to exist. 

&gt;If we use your example, and my solution of the DD to cover the credit card, it wouldn't matter if the card withdrew the cash in the account first because all the money would just go on the card and at the end of the month you would go into your overdraft to clear it.

No. It would matter.

If you have a £10k limit on credit, and you exhaust it... that's it. You cannot use anymore than 10k unless you make a manual payment or wait until the Direct Debit does it for you. This is an inconvenience. Attempting to raise the credit limit is another exercise in frustration involving checks, assessment, waiting periods, etc. Combining the credit with the cash removes this problem.

The only way to emulate my idea is to have a program which monitors CC payments and makes equivalent SO payments on each purchase.

The difference between the two is marginal. 

As I said elsewhere, Coutinho is clearly a better player but more importantly cost a fraction of both Lallana and Downing and is far younger and on an upward trajectory. 

Lallana and Downing came at a similar age and for a similar fee having both apparently peaked at the previous clubs and play like just playing for Liverpool is having 'made it' rather than understanding that they also need to 'perform' for Liverpool. 

Coutinho plays with fire and it's clear that he feels he hasn't 'made it' yet.

It could not be proven that he was carry it with the intent to use it for protection (not valid under UK law) or to threaten anyone. He was jailed for having it in his car, and since he owned it legally a two year sentence seems excessive.

null,null,Death_Star_,null,null,null,"I never said that. And the original point was that it was the size of six countries, which it is. It's why I said that there were 300+ million people and still plenty of room. 

But yea, there's also cultural diversity. We have states that want to secede and become their own country. We have regions that consider themselves entirely different from the rest of the country, like ""south of the Mason Dixon line."" Canada and the U.S. have plenty in common but are different countries, and if you blended them together as one country not much would change; only a border separates the two. Yes, there are French speaking parts there, but the same goes for the French Cajun parts in Louisiana. 

You really, really don't know how big and diverse the U.S. is, and again, size was my initial point anyway. It sure as fuck doesn't feel like one country the way that 95% of countries feel like (at least of those I've spent more than a week traveling to different places and talking to different people). It's diverse enough that there are literally genres of art and literature defined by the location of America, like ""Southern Gothic"" or even ""east coast vs west coast rap.""  Just about most things you associate with ""culture"" -- aside from language -- are firmly established in many different regions and differ in very large ways, including food, dress, customs, and even sayings/colloquialisms and other linguistic differences aside from accents. Philadelphia is different from New York, whose citizens would absolutely say it's different from Boston, which is different from the South, different from the Midwest, different from the West Coast.  

Hell, I'm Chinese-American and China is insanely huge with an unthinkable population density, but it certainly feels like one large homogeneous country in culture no matter where you go; the food differs slightly from north and south, but the culture is absolutely the same. It's the large reason why Chinese international students easily get along when abroad and don't have cultural differences. I went abroad to Hong Kong and found more cultural diversity among all the different university students from all over the U.S. than people and places in China. 

You're not only being pedantic but making straw man arguments. I never said ""the U.S. Has countries as diverse as X and Y.""  I just said it can feel like 6+ countries, and if you've lived in 2 or more of these places you'd agree. Other than language, almost everything else -- including laws, food, culture -- is different.  Ignoring language, Wales is as different from England as the South is from the Pacific Northwest. Plenty of people get culture shock all the time. 

England has a variety of accents according to region, but would someone genuinely have culture shock moving, say, 500 miles? You move 500 miles in the US and you can go from New York to South Carolina -- you know, the state that was still living in the 1840s with the confederate flag still flying in public offices. You have no idea.

 I got myself a new (what i thought was promising) job as a deputy manager for a large retailer. On my very first day, I was told by the manager that she wasn't allowed to train me as it was her last day cause she had quit... Anyhow, after 5-6 weeks of being totally untrained/inducted and having tempory managment coming in from different stores, they all eventually got fed up with the extra travel and so the store keys came my way.

The area manager comes to me and tells me that normally there would be a night team with a night manager (something with our clusterfuck of staff situation I had never even heard about) who would stay in the store after closing till 3am. She also told me that because I was the only keyholder for the store that I would have to do it. I complained naturally, but they kept waving the fact that I was still in probation and could, I quote ""get rid of me when they please"" so I had the option of working 6am-3am or leaving. I almost made it another week before on the spot quitting.

At the job centre, I had my interview and it came to ""why did you last job end?"" So I told them that I quit after being told that I would have to work 19 hour days, and she cut me off with 
""you quit your job?""
""Yes, but...""

There's Bake Off, Come Dine With Me, and other things like that that ends up on non-public service - and I believe they actually show the British Top Gear. 

The public service TV tends to be a bit more 'high brow' and educational, so it serves a good purpose as American sitcoms tends to drown out the airwaves on commercial stations. There is of course loads of entertainment but not as much (or as good) as BBC. 

Something I remember really well from Swedish public service TV was the high quality films they used to show (and probably still do). There were of course some American blockbusters every now and then, but also loads of high quality French, Italian, and other non-Swedish and non-English speaking films that I wouldn't have had exposure to otherwise. 

Yes, indeed, I listen to the SR radio almost daily, the documentaries they produce are particularly good. There's a different approach to radio than here, and music is either taken very seriously in some programs or not very seriously at all when it's just there to intersect other content. 

There's no real equivalent to the 3 hours with Trevor Nelson, Fern Cotton, Scott Mills, that you get here. The regular weekday shows tends to have around 2-5 people who are regular presenters, and there's a lot more 'dicking around' really.

null,null,stax_n_stax,null,null,null,"&gt;This season QPR have played with fluidity...Our single biggest concern should be what happens to Austin and ~~Simpson~~ Phillips

I know some people don't put a lot of stock in statistics, and even for those that do three games surely isn't enough data to work from. However as of now, QPR are getting a 42.5% on-target rate for their shots, which is the third best in the division. We've also had the third highest number of shots. We're joint second on number of corners. We're also second in number of fouls (not necessarily a bad thing - I recall early last season we weren't getting stuck into games and it was reflected in that stat).

(In case anyone wants it thrown in, we had a 46.2% on-target rate against Yeovil, keeping it consistent).

[Here's a short doc on Brentford/Midtylylylayljalalalnd and their stats approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6UcNGzE8sU), with one of the opening themes being that goals are not always the key statistic in indicating success. If they can maintain those statistics going forward (and address the obvious mitigating statistic of shipping 2 goals a game) then maybe we can exceed expectations. However as you say...if our two main men do walk back into the Premier League, we have to hope that the next guys in line can maintain those stats, and that it is as much Ramsey's system that produces them as the players.

There were some good chances against Charlton and on another day QPR could have taken those 3 points against Cardiff. The midfield engine with the likes Chery, Luongo and Mackie should hopefully improve as they develop familiarity (and there's still the prospect of Sandro and Fer returning). We should be able to populate the Ramsey/Ferdinand philosophy with some good players even without Phillips and Austin, and in doing that continue to display some really entertaining football. [I posted a while back that I thought this season will produce some high scoring games](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/3em4k6/lfw_write_up_of_the_dundee_match_and_preseason_as/ctgjps1) due to the strange balance of strong midfield and weak defense.

null,null,benowillock,null,null,null,"Wow, that's certainly a response and a half!

&gt;While it's true that equality as a whole can include all groups, in this context the word is not being used to refer to the totality of the concept that is ""Equality"". Instead, it refers only to those issues which adversely affect women. (Similarly, the Equal Rights movement in the USA did not seek general equality of rights, but certain specific equalities of rights regarding race. This doesn't mean that their name is ""incorrect"", just that there is more than one sense of ""equal rights""). 

I think this is the crux of the discussion - I see what you're saying here, but again, I disagree the context of the word ""equality"" can be changed to suit any one particular group without it inherently invalidating the meaning of the word. Equality is not a term that should be used to benefit any one group, regardless of whether or not said benefit does or does not affect other groups negatively, equality is by definition about achieving equal rights and treatment for all people no matter race, gender, religion or whatever. 
&gt; Also, with regards to your comments on the disadvantages unique to men in our society, I am personally of the view that they are generally a product of broader discrimination and inequality for women (but that's a discussion for another time probably).

Not exclusively so, but I get the point you're making; positive discrimination against women in some of the examples I made earlier is definitely a result of sexism towards women, but that's not always the case.

&gt;I'm particularly uncomfortable with this statement, as it assumes that ""women"" excludes transgender individuals.

That wasn't what I was getting at, of course transwomen are women, its just that specifying ""women"" implies that transmen, who are born biologically women, do not experience inequality in places that women and transwomen do, and vice versa, transwomen might experience issues some men do (as an example a transwoman who has previously lived as a man and had children not getting custody of them because of whatever legal definitions.) I'm not a transgendered person so I wouldn't presume to understand fully the kinds of complex issues they face but I think transmen and transwomen would experience some of the same kinds of issues and specifying one over the other is perhaps a little insensitive.
&gt;... A reduction in discrimination against women, or an improvement in the acceptance of transwomen, ***does not take anything away from transmen or men in general.***

&gt;... I know I'm saying it again and again, ***but improving things for women does not mean making things worse for anyone else***. 

I'll address this part directly since it seems to be an important part of the statement you're making; even if this was 100% true it still isn't equality. I'm not arguing with regards to that statement or the spirit of the group in question, trying to achieve fairer treatment for any group is a noble goal, all I'm saying is that equality can't be a pick and choose thing, its universal.

&gt;Why should we shy away from calling a movement to correct this ""Women's Equality""? To call the party ""Women's Issues"" would immediately diminish the importance of the work to be done by implying that there is no specific disadvantage faced by women, only ""issues"". 

I don't think the word ""issues"" is particularly disparaging or inaccurate to the goals you've stated the group is trying to achieve, you yourself said

&gt; ...it refers only to those ***issues*** *which adversely affect women*.

&gt; Of the four gospels Mark is thought to be the earliest to be written

http://www.bc.edu/schools/stm/c21online/resources/birthofjesus/intro/the_dating_of_thegospels.html

&gt; the earliest known versions of Mark end before anybody actually witnesses his resurrection
&gt;The tales of people actually seeing a resurrected Jesus are present in later copies of the text but in a style that's sufficiently different scholars debate that it was authored by Mark at all or tacked on by someone else

A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament - Metzger goes into this ""Clement of Alexandria and Origen [early third century] show no knowledge of the existence of these verses; furthermore Eusebius and Jerome attest that the passage was absent from almost all Greek copies of Mark known to them""

&gt; The canonical bible was still being worked out hundreds of years AD, with books being added and removed


(I'm getting lazy now) http://www.gotquestions.org/canon-Bible.html


&gt; the council of Nicea was in the 300s when they were still trying to agree what Jesus actually was in terms of whether he was created, born or always existed in some form - a pretty important detail.

You are correct, that people aren't spread evenly. However, The migrants would all crowd the south East and London, which are pretty full at the moment and can't even handle its own population.

Secondly, the land which isn't used is normally woodland, farms etc. Which is vehemently protected from urbanisation. You can call it NIMBYism or protecting the environment, but people don't want the land to turn into a concrete jungle. Especially when an environmental crisis is pretty much on the horizon.

&gt; The more people who come across to us, from all different continents/countries/religions/cultures, us as brits can pick up some of what they do, and become better people because of it.

That would work if they also assimilate. However, when I look in London, the different people don't mingle, they keep to themselves, in their own little world. Which doesn't help anyone as it breeds distrust not only from the natives, but also brings over all the stuff that cannot work in British culture,Sharia Law for example. 

It has to be a two way street. The migrants would be expected to pick up British culture, and this will inevitably mean the Natives will be more accepting of the other cultures.

British culture won't change if the others don't change.

&gt; Why not, what are they gonna do to us.

Please bear in mind, waterproof gear is only as good as its treatment and maintenance though!

Even the fanciest teflon bonded goretex will get soggy and heavy over time unless it is correctly maintained.

Correct maintenance for waterproof gear means keeping them clean (goretex items may have the micro-pores clogged even if they seem clean to the eye) and renewing the DWR coating regularly.

Using a regular soap or detergent on a waterproof item will deteriorate the DWR coating and cause it to absorb water faster.

Make sure to use a specifically designed waterproof cleaner and either do it by hand or rinse your washer thoroughly before and after use. When renewing the DWR you can either spray, rub, or wash in the coating depending on the type of renewal you get. Some require waiting until the item is dry. Read the instructions carefully for whatever you choose to use.

I use Nixwax wash-in cleaning and renewal stuff, because you don't have to wait, just rinse out the cleaner and then bang in the waterproofer in another wash. There are lots out there though that are just as good, so use whatever you like.


What I'm saying is, don't chuck that gear out just yet unless it has holes in it, spend 20 quid and a couple hours washing and renewing your old kit first.

You can't, they do.  There could be some sort of non-share based bonus scheme based on company profits but that should be paid through payroll and subjected to tax and NI.

&gt; There are no deductions from the 'dividend' payment. (tax, NI etc)

If it were a true dividend it wouldn't be subject to NI.  Dividends are also not currently taxed if you are a basic rate taxpayer.

So *if* this were a true dividend then you probably shouldn't be taxed on it.

I'm increasingly resigned to the idea that Corbyn will become Labour leader. But there are some myths being repeated over and over again here, that I want to address. I'm not expecting to convince anyone, so this is more about being able to smugly say 'I told you so' when it all goes to shit.  

1) Corbyn can win a general election by reaching out to the 35% of non-voters There's zero evidence that non-voters are any more left-wing than voters. There just isn't an army of secret socialists waiting for a truly left-wing party to vote for. It there was, it begs the question as to why they didn't vote Green or TUSC, or some other fringe left-wing party. In fact, if turnout did go up, it would either be people voting for the first time because they would be worried about Corbyn being PM and so vote Tory. Also, the lowest turnouts are mostly in Labour safe-seats, so yeah. 

2) Corbyn can win an election by gaining UKIP voters. Demographically UKIP voters are small c conservatives, older white working class traditionalist folks, who like patriotism, the army, being tough on crime and dislike immigration. A metropolitan hard-left MP, who is pro-immigration, 'multi-culturalism' from Islington? Yeah no.   

3) Corbyn can win an election by gaining Green voters If Labour had won every single green vote in the country, it would have gained 12 seats. And that's assuming that Corbyn wouldn't put off a single centrist voter, which he would.  

4) Corbyn can win back Scotland This isn't entirely false - he may make a little improvement to Labour's dire performance, but he's not going to put the SNP back in it's box. Labour's troubles are caused by 30 years of neglect, while the SNP have played it brilliantly in pretending that only they can stand up for Scotland. They are so popular, that Nicola Sturgeon could kick a puppy and they'd still win a landslide in the Holyrood elections next year. And anyway, even if the SNP hadn't gained any seats, Labour still would have lost the election 4) Just generally that Corbyn's economic plans are popular and credible 'Renationalising the railways is popular with everyone.' I hear this all the time. So is 'sending all the immigrants home' and 'stopping all benefits.' So was the Mansion tax and the energy cap. Doesn't mean people will vote for it. Labour needs people to trust it with the economy, and Corbyn's plans for a radical new economic plan? To essentially print money, and destroy the Bank of England's independence? Swing voters are not revolutionaries. People want stability. He may appeal to the choir, but that's not very helpful.   

5)Even if he doesn't win, Corbyn will shift the political debate left. As everyone knows, Michael Foot really forced Thatcher to moderate her tone and policies. Making yourself unelectable gives the Tories a free hand to do everything they've always wanted to do, and more. They won't even look over their shoulders. It allows to do things to the NHS, BBC, Welfare state etc. that they would never otherwise dare, if Labour looked like the government in waiting.   

6) He packs out halls, there's clearly wide-spread enthusiasm for him 600,000 are eligible to vote in the leadership election. That's a big number. A bigger number is 9 million votes that Labour got in the election. An even bigger number is the 11 million that the Tories got.

7) Corbyn's foreign policy policies and friends don't matter They don't matter to Corbynites, and are brushed off whenever they are mentioned here. But connections to terrorist groups, foreign despots and various other unpleasant individuals? I'm sure the Sun and the Mail will be eager to tell the British public, and I don't think that the electorate will want a Prime Minister with such unsavoury connections. Imagine the first PMQs where Cameron can go 'Inflation here is at 1%, unlike the leader of the opposition's favourite country, Venezuela, where it's 75%' People didn't like Ed because they thought he was useless. They won't like Corbyn because they'll see him as dangerous   

8) Why don't you go join the Tory party you scum? Because I'm Labour. And treating Tory voters are scum and evil, and everyone who's a member of the Tory party as scum, is unlikely to get them to vote for you.  

 9) Labour only lost because it was sabotaged by the right-wing press/ Tories/ false consciousness/ right of the Labour party/ Neolizards / electorate You don't get to choose your opponents, the press or the electorate. Simple fact.  

10) Various other patronising facts /rant over  


TLDR: Labour needs to be more Conservative! Because what Conservative voters really want is to vote for a Conservative Labour instead of the actual Conservatives and what Labour voters want is for Labour to be more like the Conservatives.

You're literally visiting one area per day, seeing maybe 4 places in 4 days after spending 2+ hours in LA's public transit system.  You are NOT going to be using taxis unless you want to spend literally hundreds of dollars a day on fare, and I'm not joking. Landmarks are 15-30 miles apart and easily an hour away, and a cab would cost $60-75 just one way. 

Then, you take public transit to the train from there to San Francisco and end up spending a lot of time doing the same, albeit in a smaller geographical span.

You can look after 3 kids on your own and earn £2,400 a month, possibly more depending on area.

If you set up your own centre you have to have admin skills and deal with a lot of other issues such as employing others, making sure standards are met, etc.

Most people I know didn't want to deal with that. A friend of mine doesn't even provide food for the kids as that means she doesn't have to get her kitchen regularly inspected. All the kid's lunches are packed by their parents. The parents drop them off in the morning, she takes them to half day nursery at noon, then picks them up after nursery. Parents pick them up between 5 and 6pm. £2,400 a month for 3 kids. Works out at around £40 per day, per kid. And she's the cheapest person in her area, most others charge £50+ per child per day; sometimes more for toddlers not yet at nursery.

You don't mess with a back four keeping clean sheets.

For me Sakho is our best CB and should at least be on the bench to replace Skrtel/Lovren if they get a knock or need to be subbed for whatever reason. BR is stubbornly choosing Toure for reasons known only to him. We all know Kolo is the ultimate professional but is this reason enough?

If we move Sakho (and Lucas) on before the window shuts we will be making a huge mistake purely because Rogers wants to do things 'his way'.

I struggle to see why people would spend all that money just to stay in Britain, when unless you're at a Russel Group university you can find something comparable for much less money; it's your right as an EU citizen to be treated the same as the locals, after all. Even if you are looking at some of the top universities, [Berlin Humboldt](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en), [Munich](http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/), [Tübingen](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en/university.html) and of course [Heidelberg](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html) are comparable.

Where a degree may appear to be worthless is that there is still an expectation, albeit a waning one, for some graduates to leave uni thinking ‘I have a degree please give me a good job now’. But because of the sheer number of people attaining degrees this is obviously not the case unless it is a very specific or in demand position. 


What more and more people are realising (or having to realise) is that the competitive nature of the job market means you need to work and work before during and after your degree to gain relevant experience. The guy in the article says 'Who is going to hire someone with no experience when they can get someone who has it?' I'm sure a Town Planning Masters is very attractive qualification to a Town Planning Company. But you can't just say 'look at all my good grades in Town Planning' because the graduate you are up against in the interview process probably spent 3 months doing grunt work for a local road safety charity over the summer or making coffee for a local law firm that works on planning issues. Lots of companies prefer employing graduates too. You're cheaper to employ for one, you haven't picked up potentially bad habits from other roles, you've just come out of uni so you're (in theory) up-to-date on all the latest town planning rules and regs and keen to get involved.

Where the degree will ultimately come in useful is you’re still likely to progress noticeably quicker than someone who hasn’t got one. Your ceiling for progression will also be much much higher and of course with that your salary will be exponentially bigger. Its all about putting that initial hard work in to get on the job ladder in the first place.

null,null,Death_Star_,null,null,null,"Distance isn't a factor. You have no idea. 

Does London have a shitty or good public transit system? Do you actually know how big LA is and how far away places are? You literally can't visit LA unless you can drive, and you're not renting a car if you're European. And if you're using LA's public transit system, you're visiting ONE place per day.  And you're absolutely not taking taxis unless you can afford to spend HUNDREDS of dollars a day. 

The transit system from SF to LA is just as bad and expensive. Hell, true detective had a whole storyline based on creating a public transit system to/from those areas because it's literally that bad that fiction is able to use the awfulness or lack of a good transit system as a believable plot point. 

This isn't Europe. You can't just take trains everywhere. Trains are maybe 10% capacity. I used to take a train from San Diego to Los Angeles -- 110 miles -- to visit my girlfriend when I didn't want to spend 3 hours in traffic, and it would cost $50 and maybe 10% of the train was occupied. 

You have no clue what Los Angeles is like, or San Francisco. I doubt you've been to America. I'll reimburse you if you can visit Los Angeles and San Francisco -- visiting at least two landmarks at least *only* 10 miles apart a day -- in one week using only the public transit systems, AND the trip from LA to SF has to cost less than the trip from Edinburgh to London....which should be easy, right? I mean, after all, ""they're closer together thus it should be easier and cheaper"" according to what you're implying. 

But continue with your literal ignorance. Not even calling you stupid, but just clueless about America.  Well, actually the ""Durrr distance is farther that means it must be harder to travel"" is a stupid argument. There are many places in the US where traveling 20 miles takes 16 minutes; in LA, it takes 45 minutes to an hour to travel 18 miles -- but they're the same distance! Just because Edinburgh and London are farther doesn't mean it's literally harder to travel.  If you believe that traveling from LA to SF is EASIER than traveling from Edinburgh to London, you are wrong. And an asshole for assuming that you're correct with that amount of confidence without any knowledge of what you're arguing. 

Go onto the California or USA subreddits and ask if you can visit LA and SF and visit ""enough sites"" in one week without a car AND accounting for the need to travel back to England. Do it. I'll give you gold if someone actually recommends you to do it in good faith.  No one who actually lives in CA would recommend a foreigner to visit SF and LA in 6-7 days without a car, but I really wish you would, and I'd be willing to pay for it if you can prove me wrong that it IS as easy as visiting London and Edinburgh in a week, provided that you pay for your own travel once you realize how idiotic that plan is when you get there. No, you can't just go to LA and then straight to SF; you have to visit at least 2 places a day using LA's magnificent transit system, and then find a way to get to the train to take you to San Francisco and further take their (much better) transit system, and then go back to LA and take a cab or whatever you'd like to fly your ignorant ass back to England.

Because thanks to Blair and a constant leaning towards more conservative policies, Any left wing/socialist elements of the party are either beaten into submission when something raises their ire, or they've just left out of frustration that Labour no longer has vies that are truly representative of people that we're educated at Eton, sent to Cambridge and sent out into the big wild world of captitalism to do wage illegal wars, sell off initiatives that are there for the common good and be a voice for the people - whether that be a union voice or gertrude lansby of bottlemore road, grimsby. I don't expect Corbyn to win any general elections - I *do* expect him to wake those vestiges of Labour roots to wake up and remember the identity this party had before New Labour got their hands on it.

Here's another myth for you - Labour cannot win using socialist principles.

&gt;2) Corbyn can win an election by gaining UKIP voters. Demographically UKIP voters are small c conservatives, older white working class traditionalist folks, who like patriotism, the army, being tough on crime and dislike immigration. A metropolitan hard-left MP, who is pro-immigration, 'multi-culturalism' from Islington? Yeah no. 

No they're not. UKIP is a Libertarian party that has members ranging from socialist to right wing conservative. For all their sins, they appear to at least be right across the political spectrum; it's just that the conservatives have the loudest voice in their party.

&gt;3) Corbyn can win an election by gaining Green voters If Labour had won every single green vote in the country, it would have gained 12 seats. And that's assuming that Corbyn wouldn't put off a single centrist voter, which he would. 

So you're willing to admit that Corbyn could potentially be a viable candidate to bring in new blood, and even bring back old blood?

&gt;4) Corbyn can win back Scotland This isn't entirely false - he may make a little improvement to Labour's dire performance, but he's not going to put the SNP back in it's box. Labour's troubles are caused by 30 years of neglect, while the SNP have played it brilliantly in pretending that only they can stand up for Scotland. They are so popular, that Nicola Sturgeon could kick a puppy and they'd still win a landslide in the Holyrood elections next year. And anyway, even if the SNP hadn't gained any seats, Labour still would have lost the election 

You know who hasn't got a chance of winning back Scotland? The other three candidates. All smiles, no principles. Labour lost the election because of the points I raise in response to point one; why are you not grasping this?

&gt;4) Just generally that Corbyn's economic plans are popular and credible 'Renationalising the railways is popular with everyone.' I hear this all the time. So is 'sending all the immigrants home' and 'stopping all benefits.' So was the Mansion tax and the energy cap. Doesn't mean people will vote for it. Labour needs people to trust it with the economy, and Corbyn's plans for a radical new economic plan? To essentially print money, and destroy the Bank of England's independence? Swing voters are not revolutionaries. People want stability. He may appeal to the choir, but that's not very helpful. 

The difference is that choosing not to extend the licences for rail operators and even utilities companies wouldn't really be detrimental for anyone but capitalism; when they were privatised, they were told that the cost to the public purse would go reduce dramatically or disappear; yet here we are, talking about investing billions in a rail infrastructure that will benefit the privileged view at public expense, and fares rising constantly to the point that commuting is fast becoming a non option, and thanks to rising prices in the city (for example), renting is *also* a non-option. We have a similar situation with the utilities companies; profits are constantly put before public and worker welfare, and no one's better off for it. Better to bring it back under public scrutiny, set reasonable pricing structures and let everyone benefit from something that *should* be affordable.

&gt;5)Even if he doesn't win, Corbyn will shift the political debate left. As everyone knows, Michael Foot really forced Thatcher to moderate her tone and policies. Making yourself unelectable gives the Tories a free hand to do everything they've always wanted to do, and more. They won't even look over their shoulders. It allows to do things to the NHS, BBC, Welfare state etc. that they would never otherwise dare, if Labour looked like the government in waiting. 

And what in the name of Sanity did Blair do? The reason we have the abject bastards that we *do* in office right now is *entirely* because of Nerw labour mis management. Their policies do not work. Current labour does not work. Why are you not getting this? People are not voting for Labour, because Labour turned their backs on them - period; And why should they? Why vote for amateur tories, when we already have the real thing available?

&gt;6) He packs out halls, there's clearly wide-spread enthusiasm for him 600,000 are eligible to vote in the leadership election. That's a big number. A bigger number is 9 million votes that Labour got in the election. An even bigger number is the 11 million that the Tories got. This place, and the labour members voting, are not representative of real voters See also; social media. 

Ask Ed how he feels about those numbers next time you see him in Parliament. They certainly worked a lot of magic for him. You're also *completely* disregarding the notion that the North tends to vote Labour because that's what they've traditionally done, and that reliance *certainly* backfired for the party north of Carlisle, didn't it?

&gt;7) Corbyn's foreign policy policies and friends don't matter They don't matter to Corbynites, and are brushed off whenever they are mentioned here. But connections to terrorist groups, foreign despots and various other unpleasant individuals? I'm sure the Sun and the Mail will be eager to tell the British public, and I don't think that the electorate will want a Prime Minister with such unsavoury connections. Imagine the first PMQs where Cameron can go 'Inflation here is at 1%, unlike the leader of the opposition's favourite country, Venezuela, where it's 75%' People didn't like Ed because they thought he was useless. They won't like Corbyn because they'll see him as dangerous 

Oh give me a break. This current government *clearly* shows a bias towards Israel, despite clear and *constant* violations towards the Palestinians, has frightening views on personal liberties and privacy, and will think nothing about making shady deals that seek to further subvert the ideals of democracy, and *Corbyn* is the bad guy? Give me a break.


&gt;8) Why don't you go join the Tory party you scum? Because I'm Labour. And treating Tory voters are scum and evil, and everyone who's a member of the Tory party as scum, is unlikely to get them to vote for you. 

Spoken like a true Blairite. I suppose you approve of IDS's heavy handed ideals where the sick and disabled are concerned?

Back to that above point you made. It's been labelled as 'you can't shame people into voting for you' and I think that sums it up perfectly.

Centre left parties are prone to attempting to 'shame' people into voting for them. No one is going to vote for you if you're only argument is 'you're evil if you don't vote for us'. It's divisive and unhelpful to the entire debate.

Further what I am really worried about is something that you mention regarding the Tories. If Corbyn wins then they will be free to do whatever they want.

He committed an offence by tooling around with a loaded shotgun:

[Firearms Act 1968, Section 19](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/19)
&gt; **19 Carrying firearm in a public place.**
&gt;
&gt; A person commits an offence if, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse (the proof whereof lies on him) he has with him in a public place
&gt;
&gt; (a) a loaded shot gun,
&gt;
&gt; (b) an air weapon (whether loaded or not),
&gt;
&gt; (c) any other firearm (whether loaded or not) together with ammunition suitable for use in that firearm, or
&gt;
&gt; (d) an imitation firearm.

Self defence is NOT a reasonable excuse under UK law. He may indeed have had it for hunting, but only over private land where he had permission to be. You can use a gun to defend yourself - if someone breaks in for instance, and it ""comes to hand"" as an improvised weapon. You may not ""go out equipped"" however. If you are travelling to or from somewhere that you shoot legally, the gun *must* be unloaded and in a safe state.

I'm going on memory but when this story broke last month I seem to recall they also searched the house and found he wasn't storing his firearms securely either, so he was in breach of the terms of his license, which is an offence in and of itself.

Custodial sentence was way excessive (and only imposed as a result of a clerical error where they thought it fell under a mandatory minimum sentence).

However, he's clearly either unable or unwilling to store and hold his firearms in compliance with the law, and therefore not fit to possess. When it broke I thought ""surely a suspended sentence and revocation of certificate/seizure of guns"".

null,null,vanishinglex,null,null,null,"Some context for you:
I worked in a jobcentre for 4 years, know the legislation back to front and was even a sanctions specialist for over a year (took that role to protect the vulnerable from sanctions, and to make the standard for a sanction application much more scientific and fair than what was being applied in the jobcentre I worked in at the time, managed both in spades.)

I am far far far more of an expert on the system being discussed than nearly everyone in this entire conversation.

I am also quite left wing, and massively pro rationality vs emotive decision making. 
I am waaaay better informed on politics than the average UK citizen because I find it fascinating. 
I hate the Tories. (in fact most politicians in general, although I do know of a few good eggs.)
I hate the DWP because they fired me for having a disability and then senior managers lied on the stand in an employment tribunal I took them to and got away with it (firing me unfairly) because I couldn't prove the lies. 

With those credentials in context in mind please consider the following perspective. 

1) The conspiracy thing... 
Nope that ascribes waaaaay more power and control to change to the system made by politicians than they actually have. What you describe may be a **few** Tories wet dream... However it is not the reality of it. As well as the vast majority just being very misguided about what is important and will help, most of them are actually people with hearts underneath it all, who just have some very muddled thinking and emotive based irrational biased decision making that informs their politics. They are human beings too, albeit misguided and selfish ones. IDS has become notably more and more affected by the plight of vulnerable people as he has tried to increase the level of the Stick that the jobcentres use to motivate people into work. 
Chris Grayling (ex employment minister) actually is rumoured to have broken down in tears when he was chewed out by front line staff for being too heavy handed and hearing about some of the vulnerable people their initial policies had hurt. 
I cant stand spin, and I see a lot of it from all sides, but whilst there was indeed when the current tories came into power a noticeble ""hit the bad ones harder"" culture shift, there also then followed a big and seeing through the spin genuine caveat that also followed soon after with the benefit of more knowledge inclusion of ""but dont hit the people that dont deserve it ffs!"" as well. This comes from internal memos, policy announcements and a whole range of documents I have seen that are legally (albeit lowly) classified documents I read as an employee of DWP. 


2) Actual changes made to the benefit system. 
The length of the sanctions has been extended by the current Tory government. 
However, what you can be sanctioned for, the burden of evidence, the decision making process, the level of support, the right to appeals etc etc is all the same as before they came into power. 
I personally disagree with the extension of the length of these sanctions, I think the previous levels were plenty adequate as a deterrent. 
Universal credit is a big change, but unless the govt actually passes the new welfare act it wants to pass and it contains bad things (I haven't read it as I moved to Japan recently) the new benefit wont change any rights of jobseekers or change the balance of fairness. 
Most of what JSA is in terms of sticks, has been in place since the 1996 jobseekers act. 
The other big change the government has made was Labours abolishing of Incapacity benefit and introduction of ESA, and reassessing everyone on IB for ESA. I'm sure we are all aware of the horrors that have resulted because of ATOS healthcare and the new health assessment that was done, but actually since 2010, the **tories** have made that less horrible, although nowhere near enough so in my opinion. This badness is more than anything a result of trying to deal with the changes cheaply. 
By assessing hundreds of thousands of people with a private company in short poorly trained interviews, the results are clearly a massive fuckup, again though, labour made that situation and the tories actually implemented some of the reccommended changes to make it fairer than what labour made. 

3) Sanctions are grossly unfair and unreasonable. 
See in principle I actually agree with you, just as by the same logic, I think prison is grossly unfair and unreasonable. Most of the time when people steal things they are doing so out of desparation, ignorance, mental illness, lack of opportunity, these are societal problems, not problems of individuals being evil and deserving punishment. 
But lets be realistic here for the current world we live in. 
I would like a perfect world to have a system where criminals are not sent to jail as a punishment, but instead where crime is tackled by fair opportunity to have a decent quality of life for everyone, and people with behavioural problems are dealt with medically, with restraint of liberty only needed in the most extreme cases and always done to protect someone, or others and never as punishment. 

But practically speaking, as well as not being quite there with the utopian egalitarian society we probably both want to build, even the stopgaps on the way are massively expensive. 
Until we can massively change our econopolitical systems, there are going to be issues with systems which can be exploited having no punishments. 

If we didn't have punishments for breaking the law in our current econo-political systems, we would have a big big big crime problem indeed, because we have an unfair society, and anarchy would quickly take over and cause more people unfair suffering than prisons currently do.
Likewise, if benefits systems had no punishment for breaking the rules, then there would be widescale abuse, and the cost to society would also skyrocket in terms of the state funding, and the huge mass of people who would take up benefit fraud that is now easy and consequence free, rather than doing low paid hard work.  Do I think that justifies the political fuss about benefit fraud, and the amount of time the new sanctions last for? No, and I think the system was reasonable before where the most you could ever get docked for failing to attend an interview was 2 weeks, and other more serious infractions got higher levels or even complete claim closure if someone was literally claiming but not available to work like the case of a few people i encountered.

 
4) ""homelessness and starvation and extended unemployment""
Well a couple of facts here, housing benefit is separate from Jobseekers allowance, and a sanction does not prevent you getting housing benefit, (the more serious disallowance does, but that is not so easy to get for long periods.)
So his rent (if he has any) is still covered, either directly to his council if he is in social housing, or into his bank account if he is private rented. But yeah, he cant both be homeless and starve from a sanction alone. Also most people who struggle to pay their rent because of a jobcentre stopping of payment make as much of a point of that as their food (remember I have dealt with hundred and hundreds of these cases here,) Our OP hasnt mentioned that at all, which is very unusual, and leads me to question if they in fact live with their parents. 
Next up, being able to feed himself more generally. I have sanctioned a lot of people who repeatedly lied to jobcentre staff and were caught in provable situations where they broke the rules. Nearly every single one of those people, applied to the hardship fund, and after the initial 2 weeks which you cant get paid hardship for, they got about two thirds of their jobseekers back for the remaining period of the punishment. 
Every jobcentre is full of staff that don't want to literally make people starve, and the idea that the system is set up or that the staff actually regularly cause this situation is a complete myth. The Jobcentre system is fair enough, and the people who administer it fair enough that it is exceptionally unlikely that this person is actually forced to starve from missing an appointment. 
Staff know about hardship, they know about food banks and they know about appeals and they frequently support customers in getting all of these even if they are customers that have repeatedly lied to their faces and the staff are well aware the customer is trying to take the piss. This part of his story is very very likely to be an attempt to get sympathy from reddit, because it by and large does not happen. Jobcentres and their staff do not force their customers into starvation with no options to avoid it and deal with it, even if they are sanctioned.

Of course there ARE some really toxic jobcentre staff, there are also some vindictive people in the organisation and there are some jobcentres where managers don't know their arse from their elbow, so it is possible that they are actually one of the rarer victims of chaos that do happen. If that is the case, an application for hardship should sort them out, and several people have mentioned that. It does seem a bit weird to me that they have not responded to any of the mentions of hardship funds at all, as in my experience someone who is genuinely financially docked will massively light up and grab hold of any suggestion of extra money they may qualify for.... Or in the rarer case of for example the 19 year old whose parents will feed them whilst they live at home and thus dont qualify for hardship funds, they will nearly always bitch about how its not fair they don't get hardship funds just because they live with their parents. 

6) I had an 87% ""conviction"" rate of the cases I sent up, that is because of a couple of things. I knew the system very well, I always had plenty of evidence that an infraction was occuring, and I only sent up people I was able to prove to myself at least that there was an exceptional high chance that a rule had not just been broken, but deliberately so and that there was evidence the customer knew the rule, knew the consequences for breaking it and then broke it anyway. Many cases I sent up were where i had documented proof the customer was a liar. I also went out of my way to protect from being sent up a large amount of people who were sat in front of me, and gave huge huge huge amounts of benefit of the doubt out wherever i could, because I saw that as my moral responsibility, and protecting vulnerable people from a hard to navigate system again is why i took that job. So again hopefully it is clear I know something about what would get sanctioned and what would not. 
With that in mind I can assure you that the reason OP gave, unless evidence supported something that proved it was not true, or not the whole picture, would have been sent back by my legal decision makers with no sanction every time. 
The idea that any jobcentre decision maker I ever encountered would sanction and then a different decision maker would reject the appeal of someone who didn't know there was a reorganisation of seating and was actually 15 mins early for their appointment and just could not hear the call out at their desk is utterly laughable. 
The very worst case on first referral if our OP had claimed that when they were sent up is a decision maker writes to the adviser to hear any convincing reasons why they shouldn't reject the jobseekers valid reason of not hearing and not knowing about the reorganisation. 
If the adviser had for example a (customer signed to confirm receipt) copy of a letter issued 2 weeks prior saying ""the appointment will be in a new part of the building X"" then the decision maker might say the customer could have reasonably been expected to know, but even then thats shaky grounds for most decision makers. 
If the OP put their reason as listed above on their appeal, and there was no other evidence to contradict their story, then that would have been accepted and they would have got their money back. Simple as. 

7) Some stats for you.
DWP believes internally the amount of people who claim JSA who should be referred for a sanction or disallowance decision, based on their studies on how many people they can actually show break the rules is about 6% of all customers.
of those 6% 50% of them are expected to be **not** sanctioned or disallowed. so effectively a 3% rate of all claimants. 
The vast majority of people (I would estimate about 80%) who get a sanction never get more than one. 
so already OP is within the 0.3% of all DWP customers.
When you consider the fact that the vast majority of people dont break the rules, those who do only half get a punishment, and those that do, most only get one....
Is it so hard to believe that the odds might not be in favour of OP being an honest victim?

In conclusion:
If I had OP in front of me, with this story, and this circumstance, and if i still worked for DWP, you can be certain they would have had from me a fair hearing, they would have been able to explain themselves fully, and I would have asked all the relevant questions that could both completely exonerate them of fault, or condemn them as a liar. I would check all the documentation on file, and read all their past statements, the decision maker decisions and so forth. I would read back in their file (there is a section on the computer) for the full history of sanctions and disallowances, and I would give them every benefit of the doubt. I would tell them about hardship funds and appeals and if they couldnt read or write I would dictate the form to them and write what they want to say. I would go as far as I can legally with help in their application, I cannot legally tell them **what to say that gives them the best chance,** as i could inadvertantly assist a fraud, but I can walk them through a situation and remind them of things that they have a right to know such as decision maker rationale and the circumstances of the sanction. 
If they were innocent you can be damn sure they would have the decision overturned if they sat in front of me, and they would get a fair hearing. 
But I also have my experience, and whilst I would also reserve judgement until i had the full evidence to look at, from what evidence and experience I have from my previous career, this case looks suspicious to me, and if i was forced to bet on it I would say 2:1 odds are that this one is probably a case where OP is missing out some vital stuff or where they may not even realise he previously did stuff on record that proves they are taking the piss and haven't been given a sanction unfairly with reasonable justification. 
Your chewing out other people who are less experienced than me, but who came to the same ""be cautious"" advice to the many redditors whose heart strings OP pulled on and got charity donations from, could well have been harmless if OP was innocent.
Or you could be enabling someone to fleece random redditors out of their money with a sob story. 

Support mechanisms for people who are down on their luck, unemployed, homeless, and even sanctioned are WAY WAY More extensive in the UK than most people realise, I literally had hundred of things I could do for pretty much every problem you can imagine working in a UK job centre that might affect people. 
OP truly did not need anybody here's charity, even if they were guilty of the sanctionable offence.
By trying to guilt trip those who go against the hyper idealised pedestal reddit circle jerk and suggest maybe OP isnt so innocent, all you really achieve is continuing to polarise opinions, feed the groupthink ""tories bad, sanctions bad"" oversimplification and thus continue to push all considered reason out of politics and make it more tribalistic.
Do you want Politics in the UK to continue to devolve in the way the USA political scene has?
If so, keep on trying to shut down legitimate other opinions with your ""othering"" of people who say ""wait a minute there may be more to this.""
If on the other hand you actually want a democracy that values evidence, reason and intelligent debate, please desist from posts like this in the future, even if they do win you lots of karma and popularity on reddit.

The traditional semi that you're probably look at.. they really took off in the 1900s (mainly inter-war period and beyond), though the concept of a semi-detached goes back all the way to the 1700s. The 1900s though is when the idea of a suburb really was invented and semi's really took off. 

Workers housing (small, cramped, terrace housing) was becoming unsuitable for the growing middle classes, so the new paradigm shift towards moving out of the city centre and into newly created villages and towns was born. The idea was an escape to the ""countryside"" whilst still keeping the culture and amenities that urban life brought. Privacy was a big thing, so these new houses had (comparatively to the city) big gardens and a gap on one side of each home, whilst also keeping the sense of community by not having houses spread out.

This movement was called the[ Garden City Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement) and really did define the look and feel of British towns for the next fifty years. 

So it's not a money-saving measure at all really. It was a proper aspirational ideal that took Britain by hold.

As for your second question: you may be talking about the 1960s movement of semi-detached housing where the houses got bigger and so the kitchen was brought into the house proper instead of on an extension jutting out from the back. This was a modernisation of the traditional semi-detached design. There's probably not a very good answer as to why the ones you've seen are placed lounge-to-lounge: most old terraces and semis that I have seen have been about split between the two layouts.

I simply cannot understand this statement. What you're saying is that the opposition needs to be more like their counterparts? How does that make any sense? There's a reason Labour are the opposition because they hold completely different values!

It's undeniable fact that Labour was founded by the unions and the working class, and the Tories were founded by the rich and upper classes.

The MEDIA is telling people that Labour need to be more right wing because they're terrified of what Corbyn might do if he was leader.

For too long now the rich and famous, who own large stakes in media coverage, have been allowed to exploit and manipulate the tax system for their own benefit. One of the big shots at Vodafone, who themselves haven't paid a penny in corporation tax, was recruited into George Osborne's business team!

This is what comes of giving people with money too much influence on how the nation is run.

3-4 years is also a good enough chunk of time to just get in the requisite practice. It's one thing to know/understand something, and another to be able to do it in a timely fashion, without having to go back to your textbook and refresh yourself on it. 

People, especially in IT, joke about how people just google everything - but that's only true to a certain extent, and only of the people who aren't really practiced in what they are doing. If you spend your 3-4 years wisely, and actually put in the time to get good at what you want to do, you'll be extremely valuable as an employee, because there's no shortage of people who can do a thing, but there is a massive shortage of people who can do things fast, and to a high standard, without have to re-learn anything or revise anything.",null,0,null,1440070628,null,null,1440070856,0,cu9d15x,null,t3_3hp7xa,null,null,null,t1_cu9borz,null,null,null,1441361954,null,-2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

The easier deductions for working etc. sound especially helpful though. When I was on ESA I was advised by my doctor that volunteering might help me in a lot of ways, but the process for disclosing that stuff on JSA even when you're not earning was so nuts it was out of the question and I assumed it would be even worse for ESA (leaving the house? get a job!!). So relaxing that stuff and making the monetary side easier is a big step IMO. It would actually go some way to encouraging me to pick up a couple of shifts somewhere if at all possible.

null,null,vanishinglex,null,null,null,"Although Sikhs are one of the more groovy faiths there are still the general issues that apply to any religion. 

1) YMMV effect, there are a whole range of people and politics within a religion, as well as having methodists christians, we have the westboro baptist church types. Even within any individual small group of worship like a church there will be more right wing and more left wing types. 

2) By virtue of being a religion there will be some stupid unverifiable stuff you are expected to believe, and some pointless hoop jumping to get the approval of your peers. 

3) Expectations on you to accept some dogma/teachings without too many difficult questions, and ultimately with little evidence and often contrary to actual scientific evidence. Some places will have more of this stuff explained away as metaphors, but pretty much all of them have some things that are objectively stupid that they expect you to accept unquestionably. 

4) The negative effect 3) has on your critical reasoning skills. The more your community and peers convince you to be willing to accept some arbitrary things despite the cognitive dissonance or lack of evidence or even evidence contrary to the ideas, the more manipulable you become as a person, and the less clearly you are able to make accurate decisions that benefit you and the people you care about in situations where things are outside of the fixed framework you have been given by your religion. 
This for example leads to parents disowning gay children when they have done nothing wrong. 

5) In group/Out group issues. Most religions have some degree of ""we are right and everyone else is wrong"" about the world, this is a fundemental aspect of any religion. When combined with the fact that superstitious beliefs form a large part of most religious systems and they are as such arbitrary, you can end up with a stronger need to form an identity based around your arbitrarily chosen deity, customs, traditions and superstitious tripe. This often leads to religious people being less tolerant of other groups, and more likely to view their own group as better, superior and generally more right than other groups, faiths or perspectives. 
This ingroup/outgroup tendency that religious thinking amplifies is a major cause of conflict, violence and even war throughout the world and throughout its history. 
Sikhism for example is heavily mired in the Casteism of Indian subcontinent society and also has considerable sexist views in its cultural core and this still has a substantial effect on many (obviously though not all) Sikhs today. I once had a female Sikh friend (in the UK) who was told off by her relatives for hanging out with me talking at a bus stop outside of work just as friends, because I wasnt married so it wasnt appropriate for me to be a good friend of hers. in response to their words she then ended the friendship, took me off her facebook, and about a year later she even ended up in arranged marriage. I had never made any advances on her or flirted with her, was quite happily in a relationship with someone at the time and never did anything that would justify such a response from a standard secular western perspective or even most christians perspectives. 

Although not all bad comes from religion of course, and not all of these things apply in huge amounts to every religious person, as a system, these are the fundamental flaws that any religion shares to some extent.

There are plenty of good religious people, and there are plenty of bad atheists of course, but as a trend, it is quite clear that generally religiosity is a negative set of systems for humanity to follow. 

As a species we need to make more of the good part of religious effects in secular ways such as charity, compassion, community etc. A great deal of effort going into secular works of these nature, or atheistic organisations who have these sorts of benefits will go a long way to getting humanity to a point where it can have the benefits of the community unification effect of religions, without the extensive bad stuff that comes from basing this on supernatural bullshit that clouds our capabilities to think clearly and be the best human beings we can be for ourselves and others. 

If you are genuinely considering joining a religion for the community and beneficial parts of it, I would encourage you to look into secular, humanist, atheist organisations near you too, [Sunday assembly](https://sundayassembly.com/) would be a good example.

A degree in business is broad, though. You need to have realistic expectations about how quickly you can get a job, and what sort of jobs you can self-censor yourself out of.

I have friends with business degrees who thought they'd be in the City working for major international businesses on prestigious graduate programmes who now work for Tesco Bank. They're still regarded as a graduate, but they've had to lower their expectations quite drastically.

As long as you're prepared to apply for a wide range of jobs and, importantly, are willing to be mobile (internationally if necessary) I don't think you'll be forever without a job.

Most of these people who can't get anywhere are in that position because they've got a sense of entitlement based solely on their degree. A degree's just a bit of paper that shows you're reasonably smart, not a ticket to a good salary.

Work on your soft skills and on your CV. Join clubs, do extra-curricular activities, do summer placements, attend things like business dinners that the Universities often do. **Stand out**.

Politicians don't want any of these pesky youngsters asking questions like ""why is this illegal?"" and ""Why are you having dinner with a company's CEO?"".  So they constantly demonise intelligence and take pride in stupidity.

Seriously, watch american politicians, they are literally falling over themselves to demonise *any* science, even the beneficial stuff.

Oh, and how do we get rid of all these smart kids?  Well that's easy, we just massively cut funding to educational establishments and then legally require them to teach our preferred religion alongside science.

""Hey kids, science is hard and only for stuck up kids.  Come down to church where we forgive your mistakes and make you feel welcome!"".

And this is where it leads.  A country that is, the world over, known as ""fat, stupid and violent"", which cannot afford to feed its citizens, in which racial tensions are so high people are actually scared to go outside, in which all your communications are being monitored, citizen, and why aren't you waving that flag like a true patriot would?

Your best bet is to find a 'hub' (http://www.eok.jp/restaurants-bars/group/chain/hub) and ask them to switch the tv's to the game (it will be on Jsports 4) before it starts. There are a lot of hubs around different parts of Tokyo.

There's also the 'hob goblin', a pub in shibuya which has a flat screen tv and English speaking staff who will be able to help you out.

As someone who's come out the other side, got a job, and has since had a chance to have a chat with the interviewers from the other side of the curtain, I've learned an awful lot about what actually goes into the decision.

All a degree does is prevent you being disqualified at the first hurdle. After that it's all you: is your CV attractive; do you sound like a motivated, well rounded person; do you have past experience in relevant areas; do you have examples to show you're a good team player, team leader, flexible, adaptable, good under pressure...

I was in the Officer's Training Corps in University and I credit that for getting me a lot of my interviews. Military training stands out.

I don't advocate you go join the OTC (though I will say I enjoyed my time in it), but I strongly advocate that for your remaining time as a student give a lot of thought to building an attractive CV.  ""Is he qualified"" and ""is he suitable"" are two totally different questions, and the degree only answers one of them: the other is up to you to flesh out.

Modern interviews are all competency based. You'll spend an hour being asked to illustrate, with examples, how you're a *suitable person* for the role. Can you work under pressure, deal with shifting objectives, work as part of and in charge of a team, so on. A degree answers **none** of that.

A lot of the people spouting the anti-degree rhetoric are doing it because they think a degree is a golden ticket. They've got this idea that, with a degree, the world is your oyster: they've *hugely* over-estimated what a degree actually means to an employer.

If you avoid that trap, you'll be in a better position to land a job. 

Edit: Also, qwopzilla makes a fair point as well. Well-picked modules will make your interview performance stronger because you can discuss the detail of something complex, try to avoid very fuzzy modules that are overly generic in your later years of study.

Politicians tend to be ambitious people; they want power, they want to be important, they want to have a trail of people kissing their arse and calling them 'minister', (or better yet *'prime minister'*!) So a run at the leadership and therefore a shot at becoming PM is a once-in-a-lifetime chance at the Big Job, the one they've been dreaming of since they got elected president of their Oxbridge college JCR. And to this end they plan their careers, build their power bases and polish their images.

Some politicians don't care about that and are happy to be backbenchers. They can concentrate on representing their constituents, arguing for what they believe and they *don't* have to toe the party line because they don't care about being rewarded with government positions. That's Corbyn; he was not on the ""leadership career track"", not only was he a principled backbencher, but one who's held his principles for so long that they've gone out of and come back into fashion. Speaking of fashion... Well lets just say that he's the antithesis of a clean-cut, ambitious politician. To someone like Chuka Umunna who (and I don't mean this disparagingly) looks like he would be just as comfortable on some trading floor in Canary Wharf as in the House of Commons, this sort of thing is not supposed to happen - it's the world turned upside down. It's like your old, embarassingly excentric uncle who somehow managed to get out of his room and shows up while you're trying to entertain and impress some Very Important People and sits himself down at the head of the table. It's not supposed to happen and it's *ruining everything*!

I think that's why some people in the party are in a panic - and it is panic.

Its not about throwing a 'hissy fit' or any of that bullshit, players have short careers, if he's on the bench and he feels that he doesn't deserve to be there due to bad performances or other players playing better, then this is justified.

The issue with players getting upset has more to do with BR's man management skills, when Agger left he said that he was dropped and Rodgers hasn't spoken to him at all about his future. It is up to the manager to manage the expectations of players and to motivate them. You don't motivate a player by dropping him and not saying anything to justify the decision, especially our best defender. 

People that talk about 'Lovren proabably trains better', I don't care about that, I care about how they play in games that matter. Lovren already committed a series of errors that went unpunished, was extremely lucky to not give away a goal in the first 10 minutes due to a soft foul. The worry is that if we face a team that can finish their chances, we won't be able to get by on luck.

Also, it seems like certain players have to 'fight for their place' while other players start even if they perform poorly, Lovren and Lallana are an example so far. I have no problem with Lallana because he is quality when he's fit, but Lovren still looks suspect and we only have Kolo on the bench.

This is a top Premier League club, though, and we need to have players sitting on the bench who deserve to start games so that we have enough depth to get us through the campaign. Some players can have their expectations managed, but other players just won't accept it for any long period of time and we can't bend over backwards for them or it opens the door for any reasonably talented player to do it.

Keeping players happy by having good 'man management' skills is a bit of a handwavey way to explain whether players are happy to sit on the bench or not. I'd much rather a manager who treats his players like Fergie (""I'm in charge here. If you want to get back in the team, you'll have to earn it"") than a manager who says ""Oh well I guess I can play you a bit more..."" when a player starts getting agitated.

Even more likely, BR doesn't like him and is still bitter about the transfers the committee pushed on him. For all his positive attributes, BR is incredibly stubborn and has shown he will persist with poor decisions (in player selection and tactics especially) for the sake of doing things his way.

There are only a few degree fields that you should do at a good university if you want job security - most of which require academic aptitude and is broadly accepted by most industries as transferable or relevant to almost any field.

* **Tier one - well regarded by almost any industry** (5 points)

Economics, maths, computer science, any natural sciences subject, engineering

* **Tier one - vocational subcategory** (4 points)

Medicine, law, psychology, commerce subjects such as accounting, finance, marketing

* **Tier two - somewhat specialised knowledge, widely seen as academically acceptable and mostly transferable** (3 points)

Foreign languages, history, english, geography

* **Tier three - extremely specialised and/or only relevant to some fields** (2 points)

Classics, politics, art/art history, theology, philosophy, geology, linguistics, music

* **Tier four - almost worthless (unless it's a top school such as Central St Martin's) if you want a secure, high paying job. Most often located in ex-poly's which compounds the issue** (1 point)

Things like media studies, fashion, cookery, communications etc 

**Uni type**

* Oxbridge - 15 points
* Non-Oxbridge top 5 uni - 10 points
* Top 10 uni - 8 points
* Any RG uni - 7 points
* Within national top 20 but non RG - 6.5 points
* Below top 20 university &gt;100 years old - 5 points
* Ex-poly - 3 points

Remarks: Pretty much always shows the Liverpool games. Dingy-ish bar but very cheap drink - 1 euro for bottles of Stella and Maes. Mixed crowd of people just happy to watch any game with the odd sprinkling of reds for the smaller games, livelier for the bigger games. Near the tourist areas so Brits pop in who are here for the weekend.

Remarks: A good place for a pint or several, 10 tvs, 1 big screen, several sat dishes which means they can show all liverpool games even if sky arent showing it (but ring them up to be 100%, you can check the website but they dont always put down all the games they are showing), good mix of supporters creates a lively atmosphere, shows most Premier League matches aswell so you can keep an eye on whats going on elsewhere, mostly expats, very good food for soaking up hangovers from the night before.

Looking at wikipedia his goalscoring hasn't been amazingly good but is at least consistent, 10 goals in 22 appearances in the league 2 years in a row, 8 goals so far this year.   
  
Transfermarkt says he can play up front, a little further back as a no.10 / 2nd striker or on the left wing. They currently rate him as worth £7m (although they always seem to highly underrate values imo). Transfermarkt's comparable players list features: Ings, Pato, Ben Yedder, Muriel, Zaza, Valencia and Sakho. Which do all fit the profile of strikers we've been after (pacey, can play out wide if needed).  
  
Whoscored list his strengths as: key passes, holds on to the ball, aerial duels, gets fouled often and likes to do layoffs. Don't know how good WhoScored are for the Russian league though.

I just find your stance on the matter morally reprehensible. I also attribute the economic growth (minimised as it is by austerity) to the bounce back of the global economic crisis, not to the punishment of the poor.

The Thatcherite economics we've seen over the past 30 years by both conservative and new labour governments has caused economic instability, personal suffering for many and a terrible deterioration of the whole concept of society. I want an end to that failed theory.

Your position only serves to support that damaging theory.

Why continue to grow and support an economy that so few benefit from? Just because the crumbs you get thrown are enough for you, while other people literally starve and die?

My stance is based on the whole of society, from top to bottom. I want a better country for everyone here and for all of our kids.

The only reason to support the current plan is self interest and personal gain.

My generation is paying for the greed of our parents, I don't want my kids to have to suffer because of my generation.

Admitting there is a problem is the first step to recovery.

You cannot give me a real reason for that to happen except that you don't like them near your car.

What about score lines? I had the preconception that the lower you go in the leagues the more unpredictable the matches are and crazy the score lines. I saw Lincoln beat Macclesfield 5-3. So those high score lines, plenty of goals are they common? The reason I ask is, I do like to see plenty of action in games. As a Manchester United fan, I was used to seeing plenty of action under Sir Alex Ferguson. But then when Louis Van Gaal took over, last season, there were so many boring games I actually fell asleep!

I now know what part time team means, but I do keep hearing “Gardening leave” what does this mean?

That’s quite interesting you mentioned that because I was looking at who got relegated from League Two to the Conference.

What do the people voting SNP/Green/TUSC do?

So they don't vote Labour. Which makes them hypocrites when they talk about Labour values.

No I totally thought you just wanted to give us a hug.

Take up the suggestion of riding a bike, see if you still think it unfathomable that someone would wish death upon you. People blare their horn at me trying to turn right off a main road to get to the street *where I fucking live* because the right hand lane ""isn't for cyclists"". When is the last time you had a check in your right hand blindspot when making a right turn because someone might decide to overtake you even though you are clearly sitting stationary and waiting to turn right while driving?

null,null,sonicmouse347,null,null,null,"Hello, 

Want to start out by saying I hope someone who is more intelligent can give you a very firm and learned answer rather than mine but here are a few quick pieces of information which has helped me. 

Firstly Tax is terrible good thing is this year your entitled to earn more before you actually have to get taxed. So the tax code you have is 1060L mine is something pretty similiar 1060 something the L basically indicates where you are in life visa view L ""Student"" or T ""Full Time worker"" (I believe) 

Secondly here is a link to some information regarding the tax code:-
http://taxaid.org.uk/paye-tax-codes-what-to-watch-out-for-in-2015-16

This is a great site and very user friendly I advise you to take a skim through and read and re read information that applies to you. 

Now as for why it hasn't been paid yet this is normally from my understanding companies have some sort of legal obligation to issue your payslip before they actually make a payment to your account this is for your own personal records and also so you can review and question your employer before it gets deposited to your account. E.G I get a payslip 8 working days before my pay day (the final working day of the month this month is 31st as it is a Monday. 

So it may not be deposited until this time. From what I can see the tax man has taxed your full pay cheaque leaving nothing to be deposited, DON'T WORRY! That sounds a bit ominous but it isn't the end of the world. 

April a few months ago my tax code was changed during the end of the tax year and it got confused because I worked some over time and it freaked everything out, I was taxed 200% what i should have been for 2 months, so I called HMRC (HM Revenue &amp; Customs) and basically asked what is going on, i'm on the wrong code can you please sort this out. 

Waited on hold to the company for about 15 minutes but within about 5 minutes of talking to the operator who was very pleasent understood the problem and stated ""Yes your on the wrong tax code, that will be fixed within 10 working days and the amount you have been taxed wrong will automatically be given back in your next pay cheque"" thankfully I was which was nice as I got a larger lump in my pay cheque. 

Moral of that story is I would call HMRC and simply ask them to review you, you'll need your NI number and they will hopefully say yes this is an issue we will issue you a tax rebate via cheque to get that money, that is worst case scenario most likely they'll say ""Yes this is fine you'll get the money deposited as expected"". 

Sorry if this doesn't help but long story short, don't freak out! It'll get sorted even if it does take a wee bit of chasing also in closing I believe you can earn up to about 10k tax free so I believe you should be entitled that before your really taxed. 

Good luck!

This sort of echo-chamber thinking is exactly what I've been trying to point out to people on this sub for the last week. There is **not** clear indication from the *electorate*. If anything, the lack of success from the two dozen or so left-wing parties over the last three decades tells you that the public do *not* want a left-wing party.

What's happened here is that Corbyn has energised the left-wing. Unfortunately that left-wing has encased themselves in an echo-chamber so now, by design, all they hear is pro-Corbyn soundbites and everyone else agreeing with their views. It's now got to the point where they've forgotten they're in an echo-chamber and seemingly genuinely believe everyone else in the echo-chamber is the rest of the public.

Physio for lower back pain is finally complete, between the exercises and improved lifting form I am no longer in pain, so happy days.

On top of this, I finally got back to up to the weights I was lifting prior to this injury, having had to lower the weight three times and work back up.

Also good news is I've run about 25 miles in the last week just for giggles, *and* I finally opened up myfitnesspal again after a few weeks of ignoring its existence. Decided I'm not putting on as much muscle or increasing my lifts enough so I've chucked an extra 600 calories onto my daily intake and we'll see if getting fat works for me.

Only downside is I went on a total bender on Tuesday night and so Tuesday night and Wednesday were a total diet and workout failure.

Good job on cycling the 4 miles, everything is better than sitting down after all. If she doesn't mind slowing down she might be a good person to run with, 4 miles is totally doable for just about anyone if you go slow enough.

Even with our poor financial situation at the moment we still have a larger fanbase than a good deal of the league and budget than the lower third of the league. If our finances were in better shape, we'd be playoff/league contenders almost by default.

This alone would put us in good shape to easily survive but we now have Paul Cox as manager, who won the Conference with Mansfield two seasons ago and knows the league like the back of his hand. Last season we had a really bad manager (although former playing legend) who squandered a top 7ish budget to finish 13th in the league. It may take a season of rebuilding but Cox will get us back up there.

Gardening leave is when you put an employee on forced leave with full pay. It's for when you don't want someone any more but can't afford to pay up their contract. In our case our doddery old chair lady put Chris Hargeaves on a £2k p/w contract (which is good even for L2) and he refused to take a pay cut this summer. So we put him on gardening leave and brought in Paul Cox. However this means that £2k a week of our playing budget is being used for someone who contributes nothing. This could pay for 3/4 quality conference players. If he doesn't get another offer of employment we have to pay this until June. On the plus side it means we'll have £2k a week to play with in wages next season, hopefully to put the finishing touches to the core of a good team that Cox can put together this season. So most of our fans look at this season as a rebuilding one, to lay down the foundations of a good team but taking a crack at promotion next season.

This is one thing you'll notice in the conference, money is much scarcer and teams have to wheel and deal a lot more than rich EPL teams.

Yeah high score lines are not unusual, especially when dealing with the semi pro teams who have a habit of collapsing. Tranmere should do well this season but not sure about Cheltenham, they're not really that big a club, perhaps even smaller than Torquay. Also teams falling down from L2 tend to shed a lot of their players due to finances so they quite often have to rebuild extensively. Only one team in the last decade or so, Bristol Rovers last season, has returned to the football league after only one season in the Conference.

Economically do you think that the rising unemployment in Wales, the lack of jobs available would not have be subsidized from the rest of the UK?

I would say transport links but its a mixed tale as (I think it was you before) said, the only line being worked on is Swansea to London. If that is the extent of the benefit of being as part of the UK you'd probably be better off trying to keep Wales investing within itself. 

It is definitely a difficult one, but I think the one thing for its flaws we have to accept is the massive amount of revenue London brings into the UK. Without it areas like the West Midlands, further north and so on would not be able to have the public spending they require. 
I think thats part of the decision, personally I think that if parts of the UK ditched London that source of income would dry up and a bailout of the financial sector is not significant enough to change the fact that the large amounts of wealth do bring in massive government revenue. It is definitely a contentious point but I feel that if areas were outside the UK but relied on the banks, that bailout would still have been necessary and as such, you would just get all the negatives having to bail out the banks (since Wales would not have its own financial sector overnight and it is questionable whether people would invest there rather than London) but you would not get the regular source of income from London.
People would still have relied on those banks and as such, the governments would have had to bail them out.

Parks? Of course! You're expected to keep it under control even if off the lead, and to clean up after it, but dogs in parks is a totally normal thing. We don't generally have designated 'dog exercise' fenced pens or anything like that.

Socialising with other dogs and owners tends to be an ad-hoc thing rather than a planned event, but if you get into a routine you'll start to bump into the same characters in the same places each time.

Dogs are allowed on trains and on the London Underground, although you're suppose to carry them on escalators, so the practicality of it will depend on the breed!

Once I got back, I started an MA in English Language and Linguistics while I researched CELTA and TEFL courses, and to save up some money in part-time work, and found a CELTA course in Madrid that I start in September. Finish my MA at the end of this month.

Really can't say how much the History BA helped in getting on to the course, nor how much this English MA will help in finding future employment, and I only chose history because I was passionate about it and I knew that I'd like to be a teacher in some capacity. Humanities degrees are fairly flexible, so why not go for something I'm really interested in? Hopefully will be in a decent position in a few years time, although I think I'll have to find work outside of Madrid if I want to make any serious income (I really only choose Spain for the chance to learn the language and for the culture, and as a suitable place to gain my CELTA).

Likewise, if I had the chance to do it all again, knowing what I know now, I'd probably want to concentrate more on maths and engineering, just because I've since developed a major appreciation for people working in those jobs.

I’ve noticed about the money situation, I’ve seen a lot of transfers have been “free” transfers and players - I’m assuming - have been swapped for other players. Which makes it more interesting, you can’t just go out and buy the best player, you have to work with what you’ve got and get money from the game and the financial board. 
It’s a bit of a surprise because I’m used to seeing players being bought for 12 million - which is considered a small fee these days!

Would you say Torquay are a dark horse for the season? I do like dark horse teams like (in the Premiership) Stoke, Spurs, Southampton, Leicester. Whilst they’re not title contenders, they give teams a tough time when they play against them. I had Lincoln City as a dark horse team as well as Eastleigh.

What’s going on with Grimsby though? A lot of people I’ve spoken with have said they might finish in the top 4 again this season but so far, they’re off to a rough start. What kind of team do they have? Is it a tough team? Good manager? Big fan base / crowd?

What’s the hardest teams to play against? In terms of manager, crowd, pitch, team. Do teams tend to win more at home than they do away?

The ""Advance"" payment in the deduction column means that you are going to be paid a sum of money before your designated pay-day, which in this case would seem to be August 31, and so they've deducted this from what you will be getting on pay-day. In your case, your Advance is your whole salary, so you get no salary on pay-day.

What I would guess has happened is that you only working their for a week is just a little bit awkward for the people in payroll because it's not very often you only have to pay someone for one week's work. Whilst really they should have paid you before sending you your pay slip with an advance deduction, the slip being dated to August 31 should mean that any payment they make to you before then is still a deduction, not a salary payment. You should expect your pay any-time between now and August 30, really. (EDIT: And you should expect it by cheque, in the post, unless they ask you to come in and pick it up)

Lovren conceded more errors leading directly to a goal last season than any starting CB for the other top 6 teams. It's a matter of when, not if, in terms of him imploding.

I'm afraid this isn't right. Tax code L just means that you're eligible for the full personal allowance of tax-free earnings; tax code T means you're earning too much money to qualify for a full personal allowance. The numbers before the letter tell you how much money you can earn before you pay income tax, divided by 10 - so 1060L means you can earn up to £10,600 in a year without paying a penny in income tax.

Add in the bombscare that is Lovren and whether it's Walcott or Sanchez on their right wing we'll be exploited completely down the left side. 

Benteke has done his best in that lone striker role but the other attacking players are too far removed from him and the supply into him has been poor. Milner and Henderson as a midfield 2 also doesn't really work as neither of them seem to know whether to sit back or to push forward. Can in for Lallana would alleviate that but we all know it's not going to happen because Rodgers apparently loves a good Cryuff turn near the corner flag that accomplishes nothing. 

Their midfield will totally overrun ours and we'll be forced to start hoofing it long to Benteke which will be tough for him with Mertesacker back there.

There's a reason Ancelotti dropped him and PSG  replaced him as soon as they became rich enough to afford any player in the world, and it's because he's no where near as good as many here would like to believe.

People act like Sakho being French (a world football powerhouse) means he's automatically a world class CB.  The way people talk about him being the future captain of France is fucking laughable.  With Kos, Zouma, Varane and Laporte he'll be lucky to even be receiving call ups in a few years, let alone be their fucking captain.

If people want to believe Sakho is our best CB I have no problem with that.  However, when people start claiming that Sakho could walk into most teams in the CL it becomes apparent how strongly some people are willing to cling to their agenda instead of being objective about a situation.

null,null,Magneto88,TorquayUnited,Torquay United,null,"I think we're probably too financially restrained to be a dark horse, the average age of our squad this season is about 21. We need that extra £2k a week that Hargreaves is sucking up to build a promotion challenging side. Wouldn't be at all surprised to see a promotion challenge next season though, even if we don't get any more investment from the boardroom side of things...although that would help too. One thing is for certain though, we won't be an easy match, Paul Cox likes his teams hard hitting and physical and builds from the back. We'll also do better as the season goes on, we've signed 15 players this season, so they're going to take some months to gel together.

Grimsby should do well, they're just starting slowly. Their fans raised £100k this summer for them to buy players and they already had one of the largest wage budgets and fanbase in the league. Not too familiar with their team but it reached the Play Off Final last year and finished 3rd in the league. They're arguably the biggest club in the league along with Tranmere. If they don't at least finish in the play offs, it's an abject failure of a season for them.

The hardest teams are anyone really, going away for mid week matches at the Semi-Pro teams in the middle of winter where their stadium is a mudbath surrounded by two stands from the 19th century can often be as hard as playing the likes of Wrexham and Grimsby. Last season Torquay beat all of the top 5 aside from Forest Green but lost twice against 23rd place Telford and were battered 5-1 by semi-pro Braintree. A lot of the newly relegated teams are often quite surprised how competitive the league is and how open for surprises. For instance Wrexham lost 3-1 to Boreham Wood on the opening day of the season.

Over a season though the hardest teams will probably be Tranmere, Grimsby, Wrexham from the established clubs, Eastleigh and Forest Green Rovers as sugar daddy funded clubs and Gateshead as a well run smaller club. 

That's another feature of the Conference, there is nearly always 1 or 2 small sugar daddy clubs that are in the league solely based upon their funding. Examples of this in the past include Crawley, Farnborough, Fleetwood and Rushden and Diamonds. Eastleigh and FGR are current examples and I wouldn't be surprised if Sutton and Whitehawk follow this route up from the Conference South sooner or later.

 Every now and then you also get really small clubs that are exceptionally well managed enjoying a season or two in the Non League Sun as well, an example of this is Histon, a team based in a village of 5k people on the outskirts of Cambridge, who were promoted 4 times in 7 years and finished as high as 3rd in the Conference in 2009 before being knocked out in the Play-Off semis by Torquay ( :D ) and then falling back down the divisions to the Southern League.",null,0,null,1440080166,null,null,1440080863,0,cu9h6dc,null,t3_3hlbrm,null,null,null,t1_cu9gjgp,null,null,null,1441364090,null,2,null,conferencefootball,t5_2xoai,2,null

null,null,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"to be quite honest, i think against arsenal people keep talking about how much quality they have in midfield and how we're going to need to play much more defensive to mitigate that...im of the opposite boat: i think the best tactic against this current arsenal side is to play a more athletic, physically imposing and attacking side. 

i would personally love to see to a 3-5-2 line up where we can theoretically play sakho, skrtel, lovren in the back with clyne and moreno/ibe to flank them (and provide width and keep the ball away from arsenals midfield as well as make them track back because of our athleticism on the wings). Then in the midfield i would play can, milner couts (if hendo cannot play) but if hendo can play, slide him in for can. finally my front two i would either play benteke with coutinho in the hole, or play a straight 2 striker formation with ings/origi and benteke, obviously with ings working off of bentekkers more. 

i think the more speed and physical presence will be the way we beat them because we won't outclass that midfield with technique. play the 3-5-2 (or a 5-3-2 in defense) would help us to absorb pressure and break quickly. 

call me crazy but that would be my formation. i think the most likely scenario is we will set up to not lose and maybe nick a goal on the counter, which is dangerous against a team like arsenal, but that's the kinda strategy that will be more likely to get us a point against them away. 

anyways hoping we can get all 3. ",null,0,null,1440080708,null,null,false,0,cu9hhjt,null,t3_3hpz4r,null,null,null,t3_3hpz4r,null,null,null,1441364237,null,3,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

I think there is a distinction to be made between what is 'right' when it comes to going against the whip, and what is wrong.

2) are you doing it because they're the principles you hold true?

Of course not. It does have questionable views on women, kufirs and *marriage* to underage girls. Does that mean all muslims are paedophiles? Again of course not but if passages in the bible even hinted sex with young boys, you can bet that would have been brought up in the Catholic scandal. Like I say, debateable.

It's also relevant in that it's a common factor. Catholicism doesn't condone abuse of young boys but it's still relevant in the sense that the guys doing the abuse in those cases were predominantly Catholic.

Similarly, if current rumours are true, there has been a powerful clique of MPs operating a paedophile ring. Does that mean all MPs are paedophiles? Again of course not but it would be fatuous to ignore the fact that they're all MPs (if that were the case).

In addition, seeing as you like lists: all this came at the cost of an increased deficit because they didn't have the balls needed to increase taxation substantially, we went to war in Afghanistan and killed tens of thousands of innocent people, we went to war in Iraq and killed tens of thousands of innocent people, we laid the groundwork for the formation of ISIS, the Government passed unashamedly authoritarian legislation, many of the initiatives you name above were simply band aids on serious growing problems, there was a genuinely unprecedented increase in inequality under Labour (although it did do a good job of getting children and pensioners out of poverty), the party started laying the groundwork for the privatisation of the NHS, they introduced tuition fees, they introduced PFIs which we are still paying for today, they *royally* screwed up overseeing the introduction of electronic health records in a truly profound way, they had huge issues with basic fucking science, they also had huge issues funding basic science and they did the most damage of any political party to date to research in the UK with the introduction of the awful REF system.

Divisively acting like people with left wing views have to vote for you because the only other option is the Tories is about the worst argument I can think of. Given what the average Labour party supporter will say about them, you're basically saying ""At least we're better than Satan"". Complaining because people want to come back to the part because Corbyn has shown you can be better than ""better than Satan"" makes you look incredibly childish.

If you want to see ""overrun"" have a look at the Chelsea - City game.

Start of 13/14 we were lucky not to draw the first match, only winning because of a brilliant Mignolet penalty save. Aston Villa were all over us in the second game, we scored from our only shot on target and they had 3 times the number of shots we did. We were lucky then too.

Slightly debatable as something like speeding be more a safety issue than a moral issue.

&gt; You're right though I don't like drug users, seeing people with bloody boxer shorts because they've been injecting heroine into their dicks makes me wince at the lives some people live.

Interesting and this is common where you live? as first time ever heard of anyone taking drugs that way.

&gt;I am all for the legalising the use of drugs in private with them produced by not for profits but I can't get being any ideas where the current importers continue to trade in the UK.

Well considering all goods are made for profits you're employing a double standard. Probably due to your moral outrage.  The current importers are going to be one who suffer under legalisation.

&gt;There is an element of taste and decency in law. You can't shit in the street and you can't drop your pants and start wanking in the street. I don't want to have people openly using in the street.

Most people don't openly use in the street anyway, just like most people don't openly drink in the street.

&gt;It's unsightly and dangerous having uncapped needles all over the place.

You seem to be focused on a very narrow band of drugs, have you ever thought that in a legal environment where they have better access to safe needles and needle disposal that might not the case anymore?

&gt;At least now we can stick people on for possession if they are out and about with it.

Yeah because making consumers criminals is really helping the war of drugs right now. /s

&gt;I'd rather see all street drinking banned too, causes countless problems and violence, at least there are some designated public places where they can be removed from but I'd like to see harsher penalties there too to be honest.

Doubt it work out that way. Beating people with a stick and when that fails an even bigger stick doesn't work. Thus why the current situation with drugs is never going to improve if we just carry on as we are.

I was one of those candidates during GCSE, I didn't make it over the A* threshold for a majority of my subjects because I didn't have a clue how to properly revise - all we got given in terms of exam preparation was the 'kinesthetic/auditory learners' speel. How to *properly* study was finally explained to me at my college, where the teachers sat down with you one-to-one or ran revision technique sessions and provided feedback on things such as methods of memorisation and how to get properly acquainted with the syllabus; ended up scoring 2/3 A*s in my A levels not due to excessive ""spoonfeeding"" but due to actually being taught how to efficiently and effectively learn myself. 

Another point is that a great deal of exams - especially essay-based ones - actually reward sticking to a rigid writing structure that if your teacher doesn't know about, or care to tell you about, you will be capped - effectively making A*s an impossibility. So in that respect teachers can certainly have an impact on a borderline student's ability to score high grades without spoonfeeding actual knowledge.

By adopting a hub and spoke approach to infrastructure, you create valuable and almost worthless locations. This focuses the growth and prosperity to a few locations, as geographic monopolies, to the detriment of other locations and, in the long run, squeezing and limiting activity in the hubs, too. The view was taken that most people used the transport network to travel to a few specific locations (generally as commuters) and hence these are the locations it was only important to focus the network around. That you have to travel between the hubs to your ultimate destination is an inevitable consequence,  and that it's possible at all is almost really just luck. To get from Bournemouth to Exeter by rail, for example, you have to go (more or less, you can slightly cut some corners) via London, Birmingham or Bristol. This is because the concept wasn't established for that kind of point to point travel. You're either a destination, or you're a tributary. 

We've applied this thinking, and hence problem, to our data network, and it's going to be even more disastrous. The absolutely fundamental benefit of data networks is connectivity: anywhere to anywhere. Crippling that is just idiotic. Fortunately, it's probably easier to rectify than the rail network, but it's still going to be bloody expensive and we're always going to lag behind... And in economic competition, being first is a huge advantage. Normally that advantage is perishable, but if the reason the UK is, say, fifth to reach certain step changes is systematic, that's a persistent disadvantage for our economy.

The other course does the Maths A Level in the first year and the Further Maths A Level (or AS Level?) in the second year. Of course not everybody continues to the second year.

Maths A Level is ""Core"" 1-4, then two options modules (mechanics, statistics or decision maths). Further Maths is ""Further Pure"" 1-3, then three options modules. You can't do any Further Pure modules before learning all the Core modules.

If you're really dedicated, you can do another three modules and pick up an AS in Further Maths (Additional). Or six and get an A Level in Further Maths (Additional), but that would just be self-torture.

Universities don't require further maths for maths courses because not all schools offer it, but you should definitely choose it for most STEM degrees to flex those mathematical brain muscles. Maths students at my university could come to campus a week or two before the course started and breeze through the entire relevant part of Further Maths in a special programme.

I wouldn't want to fund someone's Star Trek education - but I would want to pay for someone to learn engineering, or TV and video production.

When I was at uni in the early 90s, people were doing computer game production courses, and the media and so on were all 'ohhhh, this is a waste of time' but it's one of the most highly paid areas of entertainment and can be successful from being a solo programmer to a member of a team.

SO - onto the subjects here...

Parapsychology \ UFO - Yup, I can see that there is some evidence that there may be some use in researching those subjects; even if the eventual aim is disproving them.  However, I can't see any UK places offering complete courses in parapsychology - [it's usually offered as a few electable modules of more mainstream sciences](http://www.koestler-parapsychology.psy.ed.ac.uk/index.html) (such as psychology), but more often than not run as a 'fan course' as a free online course.

The UFO module?  [That was once offered as part of Edinburgh university's course on Sciences](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/07/18/ufo-university-course-alien-life-forms-edinburgh_n_1681973.html), and was part of their Astrology department's 'free online courses'.  Again - a module, not a degree, and not something that would cost people things to do.

The Phallus - I'm actually an expert on the cock on would have the Cockmaster certificate of distinction on form, use and application and don't need a course on the subject, but as part of sociological studies and art-based studies, fine.  The actual 'phallus' course was - again - a module offered by the [Oxy College in the US](http://www.oxy.edu/).  Again, a liberal arts college, where people pay their own way to study whatever they want.  Personally, I wouldn't want to pay to get the cock, I'd rather get paid, but eh.  And again, not a full three year degree (anyone would get tired of that much penis, regardless of appetite) but a module as part of gender and art studies.

Lump in Queer Musiciology here; history of music from LGBT peoples; no less important that MOBO type stuff or Jazz, etc.  It's part of Musical studies,[ offered again as a module on full recognised courses into music around the world](http://www.musicology.ucla.edu/mission-and-history-1).  Just as well, 'cos three years listening to Jimmy Sommerville, George Michael and seeking meaning in the words of Melissa Etheridge would probably result in the world's first gay cure.  Haven't seen this offered since an article appears in 2007, so sadly gaydio hasn't taken over the world.

Golf Management - Sports based management; there's jobs out there in admittedly tight fields running golfing or leisure centres.  [This one is a combination full time course and professional qualification that includes a placement,](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/sportex/app-golf-mgt-studies.aspx#CourseDetailsTab) and has quite a high placement rate of people completing the course and getting jobs in the field.  Sorry, on the course.  Has things from managing players health through to actual business management which could be used in a variety of places.  I find golf quite boring, but looks like a fairly sensible course to me.

[Art History](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/history-art) - Recognising the history of art informs us of what is art today.  This would bore me to tears; but people who curate collections, run museums and actually (gasp!) create new pieces of art today would find this one useful.

edit: actually, comparing him to Berahino…

- similar goals per 90 minutes in the past two seasons (Bera is .43/.32, Koko is .39/.52)
- similar shots per minute (2.65/3.62 vs 2.61/2.85)
- similar accuracy (54%/41% vs 55%/53%)
- Berahino is better at dribbling (though neither of them take people on a ton) and Kokorin is better in the air

And a weird stat that I happened across: he gets fouled a lot. Like just a touch under Hazard levels. That's odd because he doesn't try and dribble at people much, and when he does it's not very effective. Who knows where that comes from, then.

To be fair, these are all just stats, and I haven't seen him play at all, so I can't make too many conclusions. Kokorin has okay shooting numbers on a 4th place team in the Russian league. Berahino posted similar numbers picking up scraps in a bottom-half team in England. Kokorin's probably less than half Berahino's price.

If Lucas leaves, the question is do we even need to replace him? Can and Allen can both play DM, although admittedly both are more forward looking and less disciplined defensively. I think there's potentially a third option though, which I will probably get bollocked for saying but here it is: Lovren. 

From the start of his Liverpool career, he's always struck me as a David Luiz type - pacey, a good tackler and can carry the ball out of defence, but too error prone for a solid CB. When he played well last year, it was mostly as part of a back three alongside Sakho/Can and Skrtel, playing almost as an old-fashioned sweeper.

[heres what that looks like](http://grab.by/JLcq)

its 1990 to present. Especially with really low inflation in the last year you would think that it would not have much an effect on keeping petrol prices so high. You can clearly see that petrol prices just do not drop to the same levels in the last year. This could be a mixture of lag or cumulative inflation pressure as well as price desensitisation.

[adjusted brent and petrol prices with cumulative inflation from 1990](http://grab.by/JLdG)

this has actually surprised me a bit because if adjusted for inflation, and hoping that i adjusted it correctly and got the maths right etc, then petrol prices would be below 50p a litre since 2014 and it remained fairly inelastic compared to price of brent which is only now it seems returning to the mean. However, I then thought are we feeling a squeeze because we just arent earning enough? So I plugged in gross national  domestic income per capita.

[+GNDI per capita](http://grab.by/JLdI)

Again it looks like were on trend here and our petrol prices are in line with our earning. the only sad thing to see is that no our average earnings is around £9000 which is basically the same as what it was at the turn of the century. Again provided the stats I pulled were right. they are assimilated from quandl which is quite a cool data aggregator, so most of my data was pulled form ONS, eurostat etc.

On the estimated £500m the Monarchy contributes to tourism, they have this to say:

&gt; Even if we accept the VisitBritain figure, it equates to just 0.03% of GDP. The margin of error when calculating GDP is 0.7%.

That's it. That's their argument for dismissing it.  
This is their argument for claiming the Monarchy provides ""no income from tourism"".

They don't suggest an alternative figure. They just dismiss the figure altogether by implying it's too small to bother with - the margin of error means we could be £13bn worse off than we think, so a few hundred million hardly matters.

But by that logic, their own estimate for the Monarchy _cost_, £334m, is also small enough to ignore.

Their smaller-than-margin-of-error logic defeats their own argument, thusly:

King's is the oldest school in Britain and one of the oldest in the world, and as such it has traditions and ways of doing things that are a bit different to those in a typical modern-day school or 6th form college.

They have a strict school uniform policy (not sure this applies to 6th formers but it's possible), and have rules about pupils' conduct in public - for example I've often seen King's pupils running along a side street (presumably late for something) and then slowing to a walk when they reach a main road, because they aren't supposed to be seen running in the street.

They are likely to have a whole bunch of strange regulations more typical of the 19th century.

&gt;Over 80% of Britons believe that the royal family provides “a signifcant
amount of revenue for Britain through tourism”^10 but there is little
evidence for it.
Chester Zoo, Stonehenge and the Roman Baths are all more successful
tourist attractions than Windsor Castle, the only occupied royal
residence to attract visitors in large numbers. If it was included in the
Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) list of top attractions
it would come in at number 24.^11

&gt;The claim that the monarchy is good for tourism seemed to receive
offcial endorsement when VisitBritain, the UK’s national tourism
agency, published a report claiming the royal family generated £500m
of inbound tourism spending every year.
But the research was deeply fawed. To get the fgure, VisitBritain took
previous research which found that 28% of visitors were attracted by
Britain’s culture and heritage, then estimated that a quarter of Britain’s
heritage attractions had “ties” with the British monarchy.
£500m is simply a quarter of the estimated total spend by visitors
attracted by Britain’s culture and heritage.
VisitBritain now admits that the fgure says nothing about what might
happen if we transferred to a republic. In 2011 Republic met with
senior VisitBritain offcials and put it to them that there is no evidence
that, if Britain abolished the monarchy, tourism would go down. They
agreed.
Even if we accept the VisitBritain fgure, it equates to just 0.03% of
GDP. The margin of error when calculating GDP is 0.7%.

&gt;Buckingham Palace – a lost tourism opportunity

&gt;Buckingham Palace is open for around two months a year, charging
visitors £20 or more to view a limited number of rooms and a small
portion of the royal art collection. By contrast the Tower of London is
open all year round. The Tower of London funds itself through ticket
sales and events. Buckingham Palace relies on the taxpayer to foot
the bill for repairs and upkeep.
excuses amounted to the fact
that the Palace is the working
HQ for the Head of State
In 2009 the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee
investigated the Palace’s fnances. MPs on the committee repeatedly
pressed Palace offcials on why Buckingham Palace wasn’t open twelve
months of the year. The excuses amounted to the fact that the Palace
is the working HQ for the Head of State, a point shot-down by MPs
who pointed out that Britain’s parliament, the White House and the
Vatican are working government buildings that accept tourists all year.

&gt;Given Buckingham Palace houses one of the most extensive and
impressive art collections in the world it would make a world-class
tourist attraction – if the royals moved out and the Palace opened up
as a gallery and museum.

So on Wednesday, I arrive... to be told that I was supposed to be there on Monday, I had failed to attend, and I was already sanctioned. I said ""That can't be right.."" and explained the situation. I was told ""We have to take the matter to the 'Decision Maker' "", it was out of his hands.

3 days later I was informed the Decision. The sanction stands. When I asked them to listen to the call, they told me they had done so... and even accepted that I was given the wrong information. Apologised... but reminded me that I had a responsibility to ensure that I had all the information I needed. But at least they apologised.

Oh right! Thanks for clearing that up; I'm sure it's because I had read when we signed him he'd just been named captain, so was a mix up. Still, he was a pretty integral part all the same and obviously he had enough about him to be named Captain. So, 'potential Captain/eventual Captain just before signing us' to WBA is quite a large fall from grace.

Eritrea? How is that our fault? Because we haven't invaded yet? Last time we invaded a totalitarian country that wasn't in civil war, how did that turn out (Iraq, for the confused)?

There are also economic migrants from places like Nigeria - actual refugees from Mali and Nigeria are supposed to move to safe parts of the country (ie 90% of the populated areas), and the French launched an excellent intervention in CAR and Mali - if you are going to criticise, why won't you praise the West for preventing more refugees being created?

Anyway, the UK gets feck all refugees, and accepts even less. France, and particularly Germany, Sweden, Italy and Greece have to deal with tens to nigh on a hundred times more per capita.

I don't think he fits our style of play in any position though. Situationally he's not bad though.

On the three man midfield, while we have depth and prospective talent there, we have an already flourishing talent in Eriksen who then gets shifted out wide. He becomes more of a goal threat there but our creation suffers. We already lack a final thrust as is, move him and we aren't extremely threatening in my opinion.

Kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place it seems, but I think 4231 is the way forward. Let Alli and Bentaleb push each other and see what happens.

What they did care about, however, was losing space in their lounge, and having a large chimney breast would eat into that space. The obvious solution for developers was to build the houses such that the chimney breast was shared between both properties, thus eating up only half the space in each one.

also, lets not downplay how much stoke have grown in the last few years. they're not the stoke of pulis days, this is a mark hughes stoke that has picked up some really good players and frequently over the last 5 years has scalped top 6 teams. stoke away is not an easy victory for any team in the prem, and the fact that we got points there is a huge plus over last season. Bournemouth in their first away game of the season, also a team that plays a very attractive style for being recently promoted was no walk in the park either. so lets not detract from the two fixtures we just had, with stoke being the harder of the two in my opinion and the one we were tested more in. 

anyways, i do agree with you, we do reserve that right as fans...but under all of the circumstances (7 new players, sturridge out for start of season again, host of players had int'l duty, long pre-season in asia/pacific, and new coaches), i think we can be pretty happy with the results.

I really like PLO but that's such an unbelievable pile of shit I don't even know where to start.

We have one of the largest operating budgets in the league, regardless of the situation with our stadium, and just because there aren't ""any £25m deals on the horizon"" - which is total conjecture - doesn't suddenly render us a 2nd tier team. We've just signed £30-odd million pounds worth of players after selling 7 first teamers, most at a loss, and are clearly in the market for another player. 

Phrases like 'wage bill' and 'net spend' aren't going away, either. The new stadium isn't some Mary Poppins-style bag endlessly throwing out money. In fact, we're more likely to become run outwardly as a business as the *business* grows. 

I'm really getting fed up with the endless slew of articles about our current state - we're clearly going through a state of evolution having sold off numerous 'senior' players and promoting the younger players. It doesn't need endless debate, it just needs a bit of patience and that's something online football fans seem utterly incapable of. 

We finished 5th last year and regardless of what 'urgent' needs we might have in the squad, we're un-arguably stronger this year. We're established as a top 6 club so knock the faux-humility on the head and get behind your team constructively instead of trying to sound like a philosopher describing the majesty of a sunrise.

null,null,phys1cs,null,null,null,"About 75% of revenue earned by FTSE100 companies comes from overseas, the figure being about 50% for the FTSE250, so UK equities are still exposed to currency risk. US-listed companies also have large overseas incomes. While you might gain from avoiding currency risk by only owning UK equities, you lose out horribly by giving up on diversification. The UK is also a net importer, which is an argument in favour of having overseas earnings - if the pound is weak, your foreign earnings from equities help you buy stuff from abroad, and if the pound is strong then the prices of stuff you import become relatively lower. Unlike the very large US market, the UK equity market isn't particularly balanced by sector, and by buying companies listed in one particular country you're taking on a bunch of political and country-specific risks. There are a few very large, multinational miners, oil and gas companies and banks that dominate the FTSE100. These may or may not be good companies to buy, but this market does is not at all balanced. If you didn't know where they were based, would you really put your money into these companies?

Further, most of us are already *hugely* exposed to the UK economy and the success of UK companies through employment, and also through property ownership. If all your investments are in the UK, this puts you in a terrible position - if the UK economy does particularly badly, not only will your earnings suffer but your investments will also do badly. Diversifying globally gives at least some chance to reduce the correlation between income sources. Since most people in the UK are overexposed to the UK economy through their jobs and their houses, the rational allocation to UK equities is probably somewhere around zero, or less. 

If you are genuinely concerned about currency movements *you should hedge directly*. Numerous instruments exist to hedge against currency movements, often being packaged up with global equity funds making it very easy.

Is this clear cut?  The NHA is a protest party aimed at drawing attention to and stopping privatisation of the NHS.  Is this opposed to the aims and values of the Labour party?  It's another party sure, but this seems like a technicality and against the spirit of the rule. 

This whole situation underlies the huge problem with this exercise is that Labour has such a broad base that there are no immutable or constant values.  What of the Lib Dems who, disillusioned with the coalition joined Labour before the last election?  If Yvette and Liz were doing a better job they may well have convinced more centrists to join.

“I feel I have no option but to address the inaccurate, misleading and uninformed innuendo about my physical condition that has been raised today by an individual who is not privy to my personal health history. It is one of a number of inaccurate reports about my so-called injury problems which have been made over the summer.

“For the record, there is nothing wrong with my “ligaments”, as has been suggested. My strength and performance in pre-season has been excellent and with two goals in my last two games I don't think there is any doubt that my match sharpness is as good as ever. I scored 18 goals in the Premier League last season, which would not be possible were I feeling discomfort or pain.

“Like many professional footballers, I have the legacy of injuries picked up over my career but the effect on my day-to-day training and on matchday is non-existent. For a senior figure at a Premier League club to insinuate that I could break down at any moment is an outrageous slur on my professionalism and the work that has gone into making me the footballer than I am today.

[From Shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/tenancy_deposits/tenancy_deposit_protection_schemes/penalties_if_a_landlord_breaks_tenancy_deposit_rules):

&gt; A court can order your landlord to pay you compensation if you are an assured shorthold tenant and your landlord:
&gt;
&gt;  - fails to protect your deposit in a government-backed scheme 
&gt;  - doesn't give you the required information about the scheme being used
&gt;  - takes too long to protect your deposit or give you the required information 
&gt; 
&gt; In most cases, your landlord has 30 days to comply with tenancy deposit rules from the date your deposit was paid or your tenancy was renewed.

&gt; The court can also order your landlord to repay your deposit or to protect it in a government-approved tenancy deposit scheme.

&gt; The amount of compensation can be up to 3 times the value of your deposit. 

Looks like they're just chancing it in the hope that the people who don't bother over such a small amount (in the general scheme of things) outweigh the people who kick up a fuss and take them to task.

For me, I'd met people on maths camps and knew that Trinity was a good place for maths, and I liked the look of it, so decided to apply there. 

It's not worth worrying about application statistics - for one thing, that's what the pool is for, and more importantly for you for postgraduate applications I believe your department has a lot more impact in the decision than colleges (unlike for undergrad).

So, for thought process if you want to narrow things down - aside from what you've already mentioned, it's worth thinking about whether you'd rather be at a large college or a small one, and whether there is any college that normally has a particularly large group of people on your course. 

A few comments it may help you to know, although you may have found these out already (this is not remotely exhaustive, I can only comment on what I've actually experienced);

Caius formal hall is not particularly formal, so if you want traditional formals it's not really the place, although you can of course ask friends in other colleges to take you to theirs.

It is a lot easier to get may ball tickets for your own college than to other colleges, although again you may be able to get friends from other colleges to get you them, so if that is very important to you you might want to look at the colleges with the bigger balls (e.g. Trinity, John's) and the ones which have a may ball every year rather than less frequently (Caius, Peterhouse, Magdalene?, and maybe others only have full balls every other year or so, Selwyn usually only has a Snowball at the end of Michaelmas term instead of a may ball, Churchill does a spring ball, Kings has Kings affair rather than a ball).

Homeopathy is based on *loads* of junk science. For example:

- The idea that dilution makes the “remedy” more effective. (which is obviously nonsense – just think of diluting juice).

- The idea of “like cures like” (for which there’s no evidence).

- The idea that water “has memory” (it doesn’t).

I think all graduates have to stop being told their degrees are going to get them somewhere instantaneously.

It's the skills you get with the degree that make you employable. Add experience into that and you have a good chance of getting a job.

...I'd reject your application in a heart beat.

You're exactly the sort of people we need to join to reinvigorate our party; you should be welcomed with open arms.

Real life is always more complicated than it looks in bullet point form. And the people making these decisions have a damned site less info about each applicant than that bullet pointed lists above.

Perhaps it doesn't help that these things can get quite personal. A lot of these rejections are coming on the advice of CLP officers, who are checking all the names. CLPs are a bunch of often very close and loyal friends with each other, who pour in dozens and dozens of hours of volunteering time in order to get people they care a lot about elected. If they recognise your name as being one of the people who campaigned (perhaps successfully) to keep their friends out of office, who perhaps handed out fliers that criticised and said hurtful things about our party- well, they might be bitter about that. Politics isn't a dispassionate thing. People can take it very seriously.

IIRC, for AQA, a remark of a PAPER (not a subject, a single paper) is £35, and a remark with copy (not recommended for science subjects) is £46. Therefore, if you want to remark the whole of Physics for example, that would set you back £35 x 4 which is not a small sum of money.

Right now immigration checks are done on French soil by British immigration officers, if they refuse entry the persons are left for France to deal with. They could, effectively, allow minimal immigration checks by their border guards and move our border back to the UK so once they claim asylum they are on British soil and *we* would have to deal with them.

This is why we try to keep the French on side, it keeps the majority of clandestine entrants on *their* side!

We need that type of player, and I think we will honestly get Berahino. As well as Kokorin, he would be a nice option as well to be a sub for Harry as he is known for his excellent hold-up play and strength, both of which will be great for receiving the ball in that middle area and then distributing through the channels. 

Will be extremely interesting to watch this tactic throughout the season. 

In all honesty, everyone is saying that people are sick of transition seasons, but Poch runs a complex system. Last season was focused on increased fitness, pressing, and general buildup play.

During World War I the railways were nationalised, and following it they were divided among just four companies - during this period the number of passengers fell by 20% and the rail network was simplified. 

In 1948 the railways were then renationalised, and during nationalisation the rail network was again reduced in size - [like so.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zblQP6GLBbg/TbFys0PGCTI/AAAAAAAAA5I/WhS9wnqRWcY/s1600/Railway+Map.jpg) One should note that an additional round of cuts was proposed, but not followed through with. The number of passengers using the rail network each year fell by 25% over the period of nationalised rail - from 1948 to 1995.

So the monopoly is anything but natural; it was created by government policies over the past hundred years.

To do this, you should go to the exam results megathread and download the grade boundaries UMS sheet for the exam board you use and find the exam you sat. It should have the individual exams UMS boundraries and the entire module's UMS boundaries.

You can sort of see how it works, the UMS from each exam/coursework add to the final module (GCSE) grade.

If you feel you did badly in a subject, look at each module and see how much extra you need to get to the next grade.

&gt;#Aston Villa Review: Episode 127 - Villa beaten by Manchester United
Aston Villa supporters who successfully battled through Friday night's horrendous traffic in time for kick-off were treated to the introduction of Villa's latest signing, former Barcelona man Adama Traore, who wasn't the only man to pen a five-year deal at the club last week. Ashley Westwood also signed a new contract to keep him at Villa until 2020 and he followed up with an impressive performance against Manchester United.

&gt;In this week's show Chris and Steve discuss Westwood's deal and the signing of Adama before diving into the frustrating process of analysing Villa's first defeat of 2015/16. Adnan Januzaj's deflected shot was the difference and Villa's inability to hit back against a rather lacklustre visiting side left the match feeling somewhat empty. We also preview Villa's trip to Crystal Palace and admit to knowing exactly nothing about Notts County.",null,0,null,1440091220,null,null,false,0,cu9ofon,null,t3_3hqpir,null,null,null,t3_3hqpir,null,null,null,1441367520,null,1,null,avfc,t5_2s569,1,null

Although the stuff I've learnt can be learnt elsewhere, the majority that I've found useful isn't stuff that I would have even thought of learning about on my own, like the algorithms and testing side of things, as well as working in a decently sized team (7 people) on a project. My uni at least also opens a bunch of doors that I wouldn't get elsewhere. There's a scheme at my uni which gives you the chance to work on an IT project for a charity for an additional boost to your degree. Hackathons and things like that are more difficult to go to if you're not a student, yet offer a massive boost to your CV if you manage to make something cool. My course also incorporates an internship in it which I'm currently doing. It pays well for an internship, and it's for a huge multinational cooperation that I found while going to the graduate fairs.

So, my experiences is that you learn a lot of mostly relevant stuff in a short space of time, and as far as I care the degree is for opening doors with the skills required, and getting an internship gives you a doorstop for those doors. Certificates may get you the skills needed for programming or Sys Admin, but it might not give you the support and reliability of a CS degree.

Blind luck?  Ok...You realize it was also pure blind luck.  And I do stress ""BLIND"" that we didn't win the CL under Mourinho right?  How much bullshit did we have to go through in the CL knockout rounds with Mourinho?  Liverpool? Barca's Ovrebo...?

The simple fact a lot of people ignore is that knockout rounds do involve a certain amount of luck, whether it's a draw, a ref, a ball bounce, whatever.  It happens.

I can say with certainty that we don't win the CL without Mourinho's first spell.  He instilled more than just a team, he brought a winning mentality and a ""never die"" attitude.

Some groups on very low incomes (certain means tested benefits) or specific health issues (pregnancy, diabetes) get free prescriptions. You can sign the back of the prescription if you are eligible but do be aware it is fraud to claim incorrectly. You can also get official receipts to claim back, or a prepayment certificate which can be economical if you get several items regularly. Ask about these at the pharmacy counter.

You do not pay for NHS hospital appointments including dermatologists, or non prescription treatments that are available on the NHS. You likely won't get referred to z dermatologist until you have tried various standard prescription acne treatments, or your acne is severe or causing scarring (PIH is not technically scarring it is hyperpigmentation).

At this stage it is important to have basics like broad spectrum sunscreen in place, since PIH is affected by UV light and many prescription acne treatments are photosensitising.

null,null,SpaceboyMcGhee,,Misguided Glory Hunter,null,"Thanks for the post and I enjoyed reading what is, let's face it, going to be a very unpopular point of view for many on the sub. There's never any really good discussion if we all blindly accept the consensus opinion. 

While I appreciate that Lambert managed to keep us in the league for three seasons while reducing the wage bill my one and only issue is with how he went about things on the pitch.  The first season of Lambert's reign was a close scrape against relegation... but personally I was fine with it, he'd brought in a lot of new young signings, he was utilising academy players, and we were setting out to win football matches.  We weren't a great team, but we were at least a watchable team, which given the resources available was all you could ask.  If things had continued in this same vein I would have had no issue with Lambert at all. 

However, at some point in the second season he seemed to totally lose his nerve, the tactics became more and more negative and by the beginning of his third season he appeared to be putting out a team to play risk-free football.  Unfortunately such a style does not exist.. and we continued to lose most of our games, but now with added tedium.  We found ourselves in exactly the same position as the first season (barely scraping by in the league) but now we were absolutely atrocious to watch. 

I have no idea what changed with Lambert, as he was clearly a talented coach given his time at Norwich (where he played an expansive if robust style) but whether it be the pressure of being at the helm of such a big club, or perhaps feeling the need to change things around to try to propel us up the league and yet running out of reasonable ideas to do that.. but something broke the man.  It would have been nice if he'd realised that earlier and done the honourable thing rather dragging us all along with his turgid brand of snoozeball until he was finally put out of his misery. 

I don't have any ill feeling towards the man, and it truly is a pity that things didn't work out, but I don't think it's unreasonable to have expected us to manage to grimly cling on to our position in the league without also becoming the worst team to watch in it.

I think there is actually a big difference between the two. 

When a doctor gives someone a homeopathic remedy, they can say so. They can be truthful when they say that they believe it may help with the issue. The deception comes from knowing that medically you are prescribing a placebo without directly telling the patient that fact. The patient is allowed to infer that the remedy will have an affect, and thus it likely will. 

Remember that a large chunk of society would likely either believe that homeopathy works, or would be unaware of what it actually is (shaken water). Reddit is not an accurate representation of people's thoughts on homeopathy; the majority just don't know or care. However, the vast majority would likely be uncomfortable with being directly told by their doctor ""I don't really think there is anything wrong with you so take this sugar pill."" 

So now compare that to a doctor prescribing a sugar pill. The doctor, from the offset, would likely need to be directly deceptive about what they are actually prescribing for the reasons stated.

null,null,markdavo,null,null,null,"As someone who grew up in Northern Ireland, but now resides in Scotland, to me there's two questions here:
1) Is it a good idea in principle for there to be a Labour Party in Northern Ireland? Yes
2) Could it be successful in the next ten years? No, unless it was affiliated with existing parties/politicians.

To me the answer could reside in an electoral pact between the two parties I would be most likely to vote for: Alliance (who are neither nationalist or unionist and who have traditionally been affiliated with the Lib Dems, although their MP did not take the party whip during the coalition) and the SDLP (who are nationalist and informally take the Labour whip).

**Why would Labour naturally be affiliated with these parties?**

Both have been important in securing peace in Northern Ireland, and would naturally want to move beyond the past and build relationships between Protestant and Catholic communities. Both would also occupy centre-left positions on the vast majority of issues and would certainly prefer a Labour government to a Conservative one.

**Why would they want to be affiliated with Labour?**

The SDLP's support have been falling over the past twenty years (13.6% in 2014 council election) and the Alliance has been holding steady (6.7% in 2014).  In the general election because of the  FPTP system, Alliance has only managed to get one MP in one election in its history.  With more clustered support, the SDLP currently has three MPs, as it has for many years. However, there is little prospect of improving this at the moment.

A pact between the two under a Labour banner in Westminster elections would increase the support of both parties and allow them to 'break through' in many more constituencies.  It would represent a break from the past and an opportunity to look beyond questions of nationalism and unionism towards questions debated in Britain like welfare, the NHS, and education.

If successful, they could then become the same party at a later date (much like the SDP and Liberals becoming the Liberal Democrats). 

The main arguments against such a move are that any negatives associated with Labour would then fall on the SDLP/Alliance.  The UUP renamed themselves ""The Ulster Conservatives and Unionists"" in 2009/10, and quickly abandoned the name after it was deemed more a negative than a positive for the party.  The same fate could easily become any party/politicians deciding to become part of the Labour family.

There is *no* effect on whether you get into Cambridge based on what college you apply to. 

This happens in real life, but I can't remember the exact stats so I'll use examples:

College A gives out 1 application for every 5 applicants, while College B gives out 1 for every 2.

So you'd apply to College B right? Wrong. Looking more closely, 90% of those offers are from the pool, meaning only 1 in 10 applicants go to College B. The rest end up pooled to another college or, more usually, rejected. This is because, with its reputation of being easy to get into, the less able candidates apply to B and so most get rejected.

College A, on the other hand, takes no pupils from the pool as it has a good reputation and is competitive. On top of that, most of the applicants get pooled because they are, on average, more able. Then most of those get places at other colleges for the same reason.

The moral is: it doesn't matter where you go for *Cambridge* entry. But it does for getting into a college.

The daredevils free-climbed 23 of Mirror Wall's 25 sections, using safety equipment for the remaining two.
The experience was emotional for Houlding, following the recent death of his friend Sean 'Stanley' Leary in a BASE-jumping accident.

After completing the climb, Houlding, who has a two-year-old daughter named Freya, said: “I know I am now more risk averse.

""I have felt danger keenly throughout this trip for both myself and the crew.""

""I do not want to miss out on the ephemeral joy of Freya's childhood, but expressing myself in this landscape is a part of me,"" Houlding said. ""Having the privilege of running wild with these strong guys out here in this grown-up playground for weeks on end is to be cherished too.

“Stanley’s death, pursuing his dream of freedom and flight at such an untimely moment, has made me question my own values and drive.""

He added: ""I suppose I'll continue to strive to find the balance between domestic and wild, comfort and epic, family and adventure.”""

It's the South Wales Main Line, electrifying to Swansea will cover 6 of the top 10 largest towns and cities in Wales (Swansea, Neath, Port Talbot, Bridgend, Cardiff and Newport). Barry, Cwmbran and Llanelli are near enough to the line that they should see a boost too.

&gt; I mean right down the South too so yeah, not the best. No linking to communities as you said although I guess you start off with the busiest lines and then hope as time goes on the rest of Wales isn't neglected

The Valley Lines network is also scheduled to be [electrified](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/south-wales/), although subject to similar delays while the main lines are done first, so most of this [map](http://www.projectmapping.co.uk/Reviews/Resources/Valley%20Lines%20Map%20Step%20Free%20.pdf) (**PDF**) should eventually be covered as well.

I would like to see greater investment in the rail services in North Wales - electrifying the North Wales Coast line between Holyhead and Chester, and then on to Crewe should be a short to medium term goal, epecially if Crewe becomes a transport 'hub' should HS2 ever be built.

The [Borderlands Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_Line) was planned to be electrified in time for Liverpool becoming the Capital of Culture in 2008 but costs escalated and it never happened.

If you asked me to wear a poppy, I would say no. Not because I agree or disagree, but because I don't give a fuck, and I don't think wearing a poppy is going to make the slightest bit of difference to anyone. 

The very fact that anyone suggests that someone *must* wear one makes me exponentially less likely to wear it.

By not wearing a poppy, no statement is being made about my appreciation for those fought and died a long time ago. Frankly, enough time has passed for me to really care, there have been so many other people in humanity that have done great things for us in more recent times that we don't show any appreciation for.

If other people want to show appreciation, go right ahead, but I really resent any notion that it should be forced on anyone or that other people should feel some sort of guilt for not wearing it. It's never been a part of my culture anyway.

It's fairly likely the Tories will win next time regardless of who wins this contest. I see nothing in the other 3 that would result in huge swathes of Middle England flocking back to Labour and none of them are looking to gain significant numbers of votes anywhere else. And without Scotland (where, again, I can see absolutely no reason why they'd abandon the SNP for Labour under the other 3), there's pretty much no chance of a Labour majority.

The difference with Corbyn in terms of the election is that at least he stands some chance of getting new voters from somewhere.

&gt;A similar thing happens in Scotland: Austerity is not the biggest issue for SNP voters (it's Scottish independence, funnily enough)

A lot of the people I saw interviewed before and after the election in Scotland seemed to indicate otherwise. And it's also worth bearing in mind that a lot of the pro-independence talk in the first place was about the effect that policies like austerity had in Scotland.

&gt; Mamadou Sakho - £18m centre-half now below Kolo Toure in the pecking order.

 &gt; Lucas Leiva - He might want to have a word with Jose Enrique about adding him to that list. After eight seasons, Lucas seems set to slope off to Besiktas while Liverpool fans wonder who will protect their defence.

&gt; João Carlos Teixeira - Scored a 40-yarder in pre-season; surely he will return to Brighton on loan.

null,null,fpvmtimbdbo,null,null,null,"IMO,

GK: Myhill's a decent back up and Foster should return in a couple of months anyway.

CB: Plenty of quality and depth with Lescott, Olsson, McAuley, Dawson and Chester. I don't even think Fazio is needed. Although he'd be a great signing (albeit a luxury one) for anything less than 5 million. 

LB: Lescott and Brunt are quite capable with Pocognoli ready to slot in when needed.

RB: Bit light at this position (Since Pulis obviously doesn't fancy Gamboa). A new signing here wouldn't hurt but isn't a necessity considering Pulis's preference for centrebacks anyway. 

DM: Yacob is one of the most important players on the team but a back-up for him is definitely needed. 

CM: Fletcher and Gardner are good enough in my opinion. Another central midfielder wouldn't hurt, though.

Wide men: Plenty of depth, quality and variety here with McClean, Morrison, McManaman, Gnabry all very capable players.

Forwards: Again, I don't think any strengthening is needed here. Berahino is a great player and Rondon looks like an exciting signing. Lambert provides experience and quality and Ideye and Anichebe are good rotation/Plan B alternatives.

For me, the most pressing need is definitely a central midfielder and another holding anchor as a back up to Yacob.

null,null,davidpbrown,null,null,null,"Most everything UK:political related to ""Islamism"", is a confusion about the roots of terrorism.

Terrorism does not arise from religion, that's a fallacy promoted by those who should know better. Terrorism arises from the righteous indignation of those who've witnessed injustice in the past and been left incompetent.. typically the properly unjust actions rather than the harder edge of war. Violence on both sides is a sign of incompetence but the UK et al really should know better.. and that they are not learning suggests they are disingenuous and just indulging an interest in exploiting others. This is why proactive war is so bad.. it's just asking for terrorism as a response.. the establishment cannot have been blind to that.. unless they are truly incompetent.

&gt; Cameron's wording was poor, but the fact is that acting on this is very difficult, as Cameron himself acknowledges - how do we protect our values, which we developed from centuries of horrific errors, without compromising them?

Poor you say!.. it's downright scary and only helps highlight how ignorant he is.

As for Islam, that is both a religion and a strong cultural identity. Education and life experience neutralises religion well enough. Idolatry; personification of Good; projection of personal responsibility are common traits in religion and while you might contest the personification, since they do not like personalising Mohammed, there is still elements of that in Islam. Also, it has an attractive cultural identity and there's nothing to fear from that.. just like there's nothing to fear from curry.. well the mild ones perhaps.

No.. Cameron and the Conservative heart is as prejudiced as the religion's they suggest are troublesome.. casting 'us' and 'them'.. or more often 'U.S.+uk' and 'them', is just a way to feed their own misplaced sense of superiority.

Islam should not be encouraged as a religion but to suggest it we should not be tolerant of other people's stupidity is to be proactives agressive towards that.. and if you are going to start throwing stones.. well the Conservatives create bigger and more dangerous errors that ever Islam in the UK does.

&gt; the Conservatives are the most out of touch of all the parties.

Also the Conservatives are the most out of touch because they tend to come from the least worldly wise of people.. those who are soft in the head and in their experience.. lacking understanding of the hard edges of life and comfortable, they are happy and willing to inflict their stupidity on others.. which is why they have capability to be so dangerous.",null,0,null,1440096719,null,null,1440096974,0,cu9s4se,null,t3_3hpmwq,null,null,null,t1_cu9ranl,null,null,null,1441369310,null,11,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

It's not a huge factor, but something to consider, especially if you want to continue in academia.

There are university-wide societies, and you can usually join another college's society regardless of your affiliation (but not always). There definitely won't be shortage of clubs you can join! If you wanted to get involved with running a society while you are here, however, you would usually have to be a member of the host college.

Why should MPs be expected to follow who were elected by their constiuenets on the 2015 manifesto?

null,null,listyraesder,null,null,null,"PBS in the US is chronically underfunded, and can't draw mainstream audiences, Downton excepted. It does manage to get substantial programming done with the likes of Ken Burns, and has a longstanding co-production deal with the BBC to share resources between NOVA/Horizon. WGBH, one of the stations that's a member of PBS, is a major co-production partner with British television, with participation in Sherlock, Downton, Poldark, Wolf Hall, Endeavour, Indian Summers etc. However, PBS is currently producing its first original drama series in *thirty* years, so things aren't all great. PBS stations often carry the nightly 30-minute BBC World News America bulletin, which has won several awards including Emmys and Peabodys.

NPR and PRI are the main public radio organisations in the US, both making good content you might hear on R4. PRI has a co-production and distribution deal with the BBC World Service, and produces Boston Calling which goes out on Sundays on the WS.

RTÉ in Eire is funded by a £120 licence fee, but also has to run commercials. For that money they fund two TV stations, 4 radio stations and 5 DAB stations. Ireland as a whole has a big problem with commissioning original drama and comedy, and most of RTE's schedule is British and American dramas and homegrown lifestyle, gameshows and shiny-floor shows. Big-budget indigenous drama would be a rarity compared to the BBC.

Ultimately, the BBC is the world's biggest public broadcaster in terms of budget, employees, output, brand-recognition and the fact it broadcasts in 28 languages daily. Its partnerships with other public broadcasters are important to them.

It's not a zero sum game. Winning votes from one place can mean losing them from another. And I disagree that the others have no chance of winning over other voters.

And for those complaining - the idea at least is to exclude those who aren't really Labour supporters.  It's precisely to prevent situations like this one, where an extreme candidate who doesn't represent the Parliamentary Labour Party gets voted to leader.

&gt;But it's democracy!  It's the will of the people!  

Firstly, I accept the Labour party have no-one to blame, but themselves.  The trouble  with their experiment in democratic free-for-all is that it's allowing people who have no interest in or knowledge of the Parliamentary Labour Party to cast a vote.  I think even many Corbynites would admit that they're participating more out of a desire to get Corbyn elected, than to help the Labour party, which in any case they view as overly Blairite and centrist.

&gt;But why shouldn't I be able to change the Labour party by voting for someone more radical?

Because your type of change involves destroying the party as it exists.  It's revolutionary, as opposed to evolutionary.  Of course, revolutionary politics is all part of hard-left ideology, so people who favour a hard-left candidate probably don't see anything wrong with overthrowing the old-guard.  You could point out the fact that revolutionary politics almost always ends in tears, but ideologues are, by definition, not going to let the facts get in the way of what they feel to be right.

The the conversation with the Doctor, at the table when they both lie. I believe she was going to tell him both that Danny did not come back, and that she was pregnant and did not want to travel anymore. Her behavior really led me to believe that, and if hey completely shrug all of it off in the next season, I'll be pretty frustrated with all of that from last season.",null,0,null,1440099732,null,null,false,0,cu9u540,null,t3_3hnwb9,null,null,null,t3_3hnwb9,null,null,null,1441370256,null,1,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

He gets a fairly good run of games up until that city game. scores a wonderful goal, but later doesnt track back and lets the play build which leads to lampards equalizer. he gets dropped from the team, then gets sick for a long ass time. nothing worked out for him and thats just how it goes. I feel he could have offered a lot if everything would have came together for him, but it didnt and thats the way it goes. 

In terms of Caudrado, I dont know whats up with him, he reminds me of torres with no confidence whatsoever. could he be good if he got it together? Probably but i dont know. Should he be given more time to prove himself? I definitely dont know that. Will he be given more time? No. To me hes already gone.

I can't speak for Danczuk's wealth, but Clarkson has some weekly columns - this is a guy who earns millions a year from TV presenting and other work, so writing for the newspapers has to be enough to make it worth his while, especially when he's working very long hours producing a TV series. 

Danczuk has national recognition for his work exposing historic sexual abuse, so I don't see why he shouldn't be paid at around the same sort of rate.

So as /u/johnyma22[1]  says 9am to 5pm is your normal shopping hours closing slightly earlier on Sundays, near the campus is a asian food store along with a small 24 hour sainsburys right next to the campus.

Discrimination wise when your near the campus and the city centre there is  none, but being a white male myself its hard to clarify if thats totally true :( , but as a student your life genrally revolves around campus and that is very safe. :)

What to try? wow where to start? I spent 4 years at bradford uni and tried a little of everything, a good start is any sports and society's at the students union that you may be interested in along with lots of trips and activity's throughout the year going to all parts of the UK made for international students like yourself.

Ok what to avoid. Well it would take a fair bit of walking off your routes from the campus and the city centre to get anywhere dangerous. There are pubs/bars to avoid like the ginger goose or ones further away from campus, but your not likely to wander into them. the UK has quite a drinking culture and the best places to experience that as a student would the students unions bar, along with delius and the westleigh which are common student hangouts.
I'd never had any problems with cineworld but thats because of being with a group of students the bradford media museum also has a big screen for films as well.

For your question of wildlife in the town there alot of cats around but ive never seen stray dogs. Theres no need to worry about rabies as there are no animals in the UK that carry it, as for insects due to a colder climate there are far less than other warmer countries.

Practice the Edescel igcse specimen listening papers that you can find online, and when you run out of those do the Edexcel and AQA regular gcse ones, which are relatively similar.

  
The oral exam is the most nerve-wracking and difficult, IMO. To get an A * , unless you're a native speaker or incredibly proficient, you need to prepare answers. There is a specimen question booklet you can get, and your teachers may have prepared an extra one, so use those questions and any similar ones you can think of, and write *detailed* answers to them. To boost your grade you need to use lots of opinion phrases (meiner Meinung nach, ich glaube, dass etc.), good set phrases and relatively advanced vocabulary. Your answers should be as long as possible, so you can keep talking and sound like you are fluently and actively participating in the conversation. Personally, I found the questions on the chosen photo the hardest because the questions you get asked are more abstract and random, so be prepared to come up with decent answers on the spot.

  
If you are aiming for 10 A * s, I presume you are pretty good at memorising things quickly. With German, you need to memorise plenty of vocabulary, including genders and plurals of nouns. To further improve accuracy, thoroughly learn adjective endings (all 3 tables of 16), verb conjugations and all articles in different cases. I think this was one factor that helped me consistently do well in reading and writing papers. Writing is the most important as it is harder, and once you can produce A * grade 150 word essays, the reading sections should be no problem.

&gt; Gayle

As a winger, fine. As a striker, he has shown with his goals to game ratio that he can't cut it in the Premier League but he does fit Alex Neil's system.

&gt;Austin

No chance, although in a perfect world he would be our star striker but we ain't paying £15m for him.

&gt; Jelavic

He just reminds me of RvW and Lafferty style of play which doesn't succeed in Alex Neil's system so I can't see why he would be brought in.

Firstly, what is ""the north"" and why isn't Scotland considered such despite being further north than all of these other places?  Are we talking about Yorkshire?  Rural Cumbria?  Berwick-upon-Tweed?  Or shall we go with the standard Wesminster definition of ""Greater Manchester and possibly Leeds if it asks nicely""?

Secondly, ""the north"" is only cheap (which in itself is debatable) due to there being absolutely nothing there and local salaries are usually pathetic because there are few viable jobs outwith Leeds or Manchester.

Thirdly, Manchester is a rough post-industrialist dump and the ""grim up norff"" stereotype isn't just well deserved, it was designed and commissioned purely with Manchester in mind.

I'd rather pay the premium and live in the south (contrary to popular belief, the south is **not** totally unaffordable for 200% of the people who live there) where I have the chance of a better career, a better salary, and better everything - or I could move back to Scotland.

Pros: 

- Magnificent first touch. Fucking sublime. 

- He's got a beautiful left footed curler that he can sink in the net time and time again

- Nearly unstoppable dribbler. He just forces his way through and has the footwork to get by any player.

Cons:

- ~~His vision is lacking. Seems like he doesn't even notice how wide open some players are on the run.~~ 21 assists and bad vision are pretty much mutually exclusive. 

- Sometimes his flair gets the best of him. He tries a funky move which ends up having no benefit.

- Lastly he can be a ball hog on occasion. Not too often, but he will sometimes ignore his teammates when passing is obviously the best option. I suppose it's not lack of vision, it just looks as if he's choosing dribbling over passing for no good reason.

Overall I think he could certainly be a benefit to the squad. He'd be good in rotation with either Mirallas or Barkley. I'm not getting overly hyped about him though. He seems ~~good~~ great but not spectacular.

To be honest the main flaw is appealing to the idea that there is some corrupt elite when the sad fact is that there isn't. We don't even need one - you just need a system that incentivises such behaviour and people will behave that way.

It's not like we can just get rid of the bankers or the boomers or the 1% or whatever and all the problems just disappear. I mean the large investment funds are often pensions of workers and they pay hedge fund managers a lot because if the manager can improve the ROI by 0.01% then he can be 'worth' hundreds of millions. It's not a secretive cabal, just a shitty system.

Also, strictly speaking, his politics aren't ""revolutionary"". ""Revolutionary politics"" specifically refers to a movement that drastically changes the government - usually through a coup. Corbyn isn't a revolutionary socialist, he's a reformist. He has consistently says that he wants his shadow cabinet to represent the entire ""Labour church"", from people on his end, to Blairites. He isn't looking to dismantle the party, he's looking to have a debate within the Labour party to find its direction, involving all sides. That's the opposite of revolutionary.

He doesn't want to replace the old guard, only to convince the old guard that his aims are the aims that the old guard want.

[The Brecon County Times, 11 December 1919](http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3859867/3859874/61/devolution)

&gt; A conference representatives of local authorities, convened the Welsh members of the Speaker's Commission (which was appointed to report on the question of devolution and the establishment of local Parlaments in the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom), was held at Shrewsbury on the 3rd inst. Lord Aberdare was voted to the chair. Amongst those present were Lord Glannsk (chair- man of the Breconshire County Council),. Mr W. F. Parry deWinton (mayor of Brecon) and Mr G. Hyatt Williams (town clerk of Brecon). 

&gt; Some confidential information was put before the meeting by Mr J. Hugh Edwards, M.P., showing what subjects and powers the imperial Parliament might desire to retain for itself and what powers might be delegated to local Parliaments; Mr Edwards said there was no question but that there would be a Parliament for, Wales if the people declared in its favour, and the Commission had accepted Wales as a national unit, with one Parliament. Ireland would probably have two Parliaments, one for Ulster and one for the rest of the island. There was a great division of opinion as to, whether there should be one or more Parliaments for England. 

&gt; The old differences of opinion as to the location of a Welsh Parliament developed early in the meeting, and Mr J. Hugh Edwards made the somewhat surprising announcement that in the last report this question would be decided by the Cabinet, ""in other words by the Prime Minister himself, and his word would be law."" The Prime Minister however, was open to receive suggestions. It had been represented to the Welsh Commissioners that Salop would like to come into a Welsh Parliament and that Shrews- bury would be the best location for it. Mr Forester Waiker And Hereford has also approached us. No formal resolutions were carried, but an advisory committee was appointed to prepare information for the Speaker's Commission.

[The North Wales Express, 28th October 1910](http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3573237/3573242/28/home%20rule%20AND%20wales)

&gt; Home Rule all round is in the air, and it is even surmised that this is the solution that will be adopted for the Constitutional problem. To Welshmen, Home Rule for Ireland and Scotland should matter little, the question for us being Home Rule for Wales; in so far as we can utilise the other countries to attain this object, they will be useful to us, but the time for romantic -and unpaid for- sacrifice on Wales' part on the altars of other countries has gone by. When Parliament meets, Welsh members should make it quite clear that national legislative independence is a thing that the Welsh nation insists upon having, and not merely something they are going to accept gratefully from an English Government when it thinks fit to extend the boon. In Wales we have long ago found out that gratitude and fidelity do not impress Liberal Governments, and that one is much more likely to obtain what one wants by being feared than by being loved. It is time that Wales should adopt Irish tactics, and by assuming an entirely independent attitude in Parliament win a little more for itself, even at the cost of winning a little less for its representatives. 

&gt; Few in this country will deny that self-government for Wales is a desirable thing, but it can only be won by the united action of the members for Wales in the present House of Commons. It is time the country brought the members to their senses. It is time they realised what they were sent to the House of Commons for. Many of them are very amiable men, some of them are very able men, and a good many of them have done very well-for themselves; but with three or four exceptions, they have done little for Wales. They are too respectable, too much afraid of offending English opinion too fond of English society and English popularity, and too eager to get on. One cannot help feeling a certain pride in our countrymen who have attained to great positions, but that is a feeling that should be watched lest we forget our country in the success of individuals. No one will deny that the Welsh Party includes men of great gifts, but the fact remains that the Welsh Party, in Parliament as a whole is laughed at. It as treated with contempt, as the Irish Party was treated with contempt under the leadership of Isaac Butt. Home Rule was then as joke as Disestablishment is a joke now. We want men who care nothing for the English members, nothing for the English Government and the positions it has at its disposal, but who do care intensely for Wales for its national independence, and for its future. 

&gt; We must impress upon the mind of the Government that we must have Home Rule, as it is clear that without that we cannot hope for Disestablishment and the many other social and political reforms Wales has waited too long for. Every Welsh member of Parliament must be told that for him Wales comes first and Liberalism afterwards. If the cause of Wales demands that a Liberal Government shall be harassed and even wrecked, then that must be done. Until they are convinced that we are ready to go to that extremity, we can get nothing from the English. Mr Lloyd George saw this quite clearly in 1895, and we may be sure that one of the keenest political brains and the best political strategist in the country was not mistaken. It will be the place of the constituents to give orders to their representatives, and we are confident that most of the Welsh members would welcome such instructions. As to the others, they would have to go. 

&gt; This question of Home Rule is now really the only one on which the Welsh progressives can show an united front to the enemy. On very many questions Liberal members like Sir Herbert Roberts and Labour members like Mr Thomas Richards cannot be expected to co-operate, and we tire left face to face with the question: is the representation of Wales to be divided in such a manner as to leave us practically unrepresented, or shall there be a strong, united, and aggressive Welsh Party, with one aim and one object? We hardly expect the people of Wales will hesitate long before they answer that question.

Some things really don't change, do they?

null,null,frenLdD,null,null,null,"Confession: The last time I was at Villa Park was Boxing Day 2013. 

What I witnessed that day was not Premier League football.

I saw a Villa team set up in a rigid 4-4-2, and not move.  They couldn't pass to each other, they didn't know how to move off the ball.  It was an embarrassingly amateur display.  As I left my £35 seat in injury time, Dwight Gayle scored.

I haven't bought a ticket since.

You can tell me about how difficult Lambert's job was, and I would agree.

You can tell me that the club had to do some necessary financial restructuring during his time there, and yes, that is true.

...He was still a football manager working with professional football players.  That Palace 'performance' was far from a one-off, as we're all too aware.  And I'm not talking about entertainment, and I'm not talking about pretty aesthetic football.  I mean basic competence.  Having a clue.  Not looking like a Sunday League side with the ball.

Some people talk about the budget Lambert had to work with as if he was working with thin air, on a hiding to nothing.  As if he didn't have a smaller budget at Norwich.  As if the likes of Swansea or Villareal were rolling in it.  As if Bradford City and Leyton Orient eliminated us via expensively acquired talent.  As if you can't coach a football team to play at a competent level unless you spend £40 million a season.

Cultivating talent?  I'm under the impression Lambert didn't do much on the training ground, he left that to his coaches.  Correct me if I'm wrong there.  And please don't give him any credit for Grealish.

I don't agree that we transitioned from a McLeish team to this Sherwood team. We transitioned from a McLeish team to one that was just as bad or (somehow) worse, and Paul was sacked in time before he took us down.  I doubt you'd be saying thanks if he'd stayed three months longer, because we'd likely be in the Championship now.

Under Lambert we played some of the most amateurish football I've seen in nearly 25 years of visiting Villa Park.

It looks like the author is attaching moral guilt of some kind to Corbyn by using the word ""blame"" but it isn't obvious at first glance what moral crime Corbyn is guilty of, since the anti-Semite accusations say more about the black and white understanding of geopolitics of his accusers (you're with us or you're against us/you must condemn all critics of Israel or you're an anti-Semite like the worst of them) than Corbyn himself (I think we can agree with a person on one issue, such as the Iraq war, without it being assumed we agree with every issue that person holds).

&gt;they always transparently wished they were.

&gt;This, for two decades, has been Jeremy Corbyn’s political hinterland.

Here the author leaps from an anecdote about a placard, to painting that anecdote as indicative of Corbyn's entire worldview. Either the anecdote was a pointless ramble or we are meant to literally believe Corbyn sees every issue in terms of its relationship with Israel, which is obviously false but that's the impression I get from the author.

&gt;He could have called it out 20 years ago, had he wished. He didn’t wish. This is what you get.

This reads like the author thinks he has made a crushing conclusion, but I'm still unsure what the ""it"" is he is referring to or how he could satisfactorily ""call it out"".

I have done this myself, some years ago when I lived in a large shared house and the landlords lived there as well, I should add I did ask the landlord if I could put in the false claim before doing it. As I was hard up I thought I might be able to scam the housing benefit people to pay my whole rent rather than a portion, maybe even make a profit. Anyway, the main problem is you have told the council that your landlord are earning £X from you every month so they in turn will have to pay income tax on that money, somehow Inland Revenue knew this as well and they were asking my landlords for the income tax from the rent I was supposedly paying. 

This got me in quite a bit of bother in the end and one thing lead to another and I was evicted from that house.

The thing I found out later was I could've told the housing what my real rent was and I would've got the same amount of money as you didn't used to get more money because your rent was higher it was all decided on the size of the house and the claimants income, so you could tell them your rent is more but chances are you won't get anymore money from them.

If you didn't vote at all then you have no right to whinge about the result nationally.

* If you think that most political parties don't fit your views then you're either a) have unrealistic expectations of a political party fulfilling all of your precise political views or b) a political extremist who shouldn't be surprised, and if you're views are so far outside the mainstream then you're probably wrong anyway

* People tend to have no idea what they're talking about when they talk about the Nordic model and downvote people who try and pop the bubble

* I like Nick Clegg. Moreover I have no idea why some people were surprised when the Lib Dems went into coalition with the Tories. Also the new tuition fees system is more progressive than the previous one (people eagerly point out that national debt isn't the same as personal debt but don't stop to consider that student debt isn't like personal debt either). I also reckon that the reason many voters left the Lib Dems is because they are a nomadic bloc of protest voters who don't care about policies or ideology but simply want to vote for a party that won't get in to powers so they can smugly look back on the whole thing and say that they can't be blamed.

* I think that the only logical conclusion is that Northern Ireland should rejoin the rest of Ireland (though it can only be done through a referendum)

* If you downvote then you should comment

* Most people don't know nearly as much as they think that they do, especially about politics and economics, and should usually have conditions to what they post (I'm open to the idea that I don't either). Most people's ""opinions"" are also just simply either incorrect or conspiracy theories

* I hate cats. They're inferior to dogs in every single way. I don't even know if this is something /r/unitedkingdom has an opinion on, I just think that it has to be said.

* I'm not convinced that Corbyn will either lead the Labour Party to victory or defeat. I think that it could go either way.

* Gordon Brown was fucking awful

* Ed Miliband was alright

* I think that the government is right to say that we should replace the relative poverty target with other root causes of poverty 

* I think that there should be a 13th month as 52 divides into 13 by 4 rather than the current system in which months have varying days

* I think that Osborne will be an alright PM, he just won't be a popular one as he has very little emotional intelligence

* Calling anyone who is less left wing than you ""Tory-lite"" simply entrenches the perception that the whole political landscape is defined by the Conservatives, which itself means that Labour is always on the backfoot

* I love London and I think that it is our only world-class city

* North of Birmingham is the North, South of Birmingham is the South, Birmingham itself is equally disowned by both

* I would be very surprised if we aren't using the Euro in 40 years

null,null,disco54,null,null,null,"Housing benefit can be awarded to someone based on the amount they earn relative to the amount the government states they need to earn in a week. The government calls this amount - Applicable Amount and it changes for different family units. So single people are different to single parents, disabled people are different to pensioners and so on.

The income of the family unit is calculated, certain things are disregarded and then 
If you earn the same or less than your applicable amount you get full housing benefit. If you you earn more you might then be able to claim something but not the full amount, its a sliding scale. 

It gets complicated because there are two types of housing benefit - council property is straightforward, HB is just paid.

If you rent privately you are subject to Local Housing Allowance - LHA means you get paid for the amount of bedrooms you need rather than the bedrooms you've got. Confused? Not surprised. If you look on any council website and go to HB section you'll see the LHA rates and they say how much a family unit can get paid each week. Lets say a single parent with one child lives in a three bedroom flat, they will only get paid the two bedroom rate and incur bedroom tax.

You are spend no-ones taxes, they pay taxes to the government, who then decide how to disburse them. In this case your benefits are awarded to you to spend how you see fit. Is smoking intelligent? No. I know that, you know that, but I do not judge you financially for doing that....  It has no relevance in this situation.

Not getting any food becomes a health matter and will be of concern to your GP who kay be able to intervene and know how to... 

3) use the internet at your library (it is free) to seek out hardship and emergency funding.

Fear of loss fuelled the over all vote for the Conservatives.. not because the electorate are now Conservatives.

Look at the options there were.. the Labour party is a mess.. legacy of New Labour looms large.. and at a time of the financial crisis, it doesn't take much to recognise that while Labour can spot a problem that's right in front of them, they know nothing of how to solve it.. policy vacuum at the election.

There was clearly an error in the UK electorates perception as they went rather strong against the LibDems but them some of their candidates are weak, still we need liberal politics more than we even need conservative. Some people need to piss on the electric fence and some people don't care that it's the less fortunate that will suffer in their place.

Given Labour's reckless past, giving them a shock might also have been widely considered.. shake them up and JC just feeding into that and seeing that influx to Labour party on the back of people wanting a real opposition and not Conservative-lite that was New Labour.

The cards are in fully working condition. They've only been taken out of the box and the bag to make sure they're in working order, and includes the CD with drivers and cables.

I'm selling them because during the memory fiasco I couldn't get a refund, as I (stupidly) brought from Flubit well before the scandal had broken out, and couldn't get a refund from them.

Where there is heavy dispute, however, is that a lot of the PLP are really terrified at the prospect of the Tories winning in 2020; and are extremely worried that Corbyn could take us on the path towards a Tory victory. In their view, taking this principled view means nothing if we are in opposition, as how can we build more social housing if we aren't the government?

My personal view is that the PLP have let the panic get the better of them and is stopping them thinking things through calmly.

Benefits should be abolished; I can't decide where to draw the line on it, but I hate the idea of living off other people's work. It's lazy and entitled. This is a tricky one, granted, but things like Job Seekers allowance can definitely go

The NHS should be fully privatised to become a model of Obamacare. Those who can afford private healthcare (say over £25,000 pa, so really a lot of people) have to pay and everyone under gets access to a revised down NHS. The NHS is an economic unsustainable burden and it needs to be cut loose or its budget will grow too big and bankrupt the country

Income tax should be a flat rate - maybe around 20%. Higher earners deserve to keep the money they earn rather than hand nearly the majority of it over to the State. 45% is ludicrous and no one should be entitled to other people's money 

The Armed Forces needs to be massively expanded in all areas, (using some of the money saved by scrapping the NHS) to protect us from or play a role in the destruction of enemies of the UK such as ISIS 

Jeremy Corbyn is going to fuck the country up completely if he ever gets in power. As it goes I believe he is unelectable since he seems to want to persecute anyone with money. His proposed 60% income tax would slap the ambition out of earning money completely

Firstly you have a proper butcher who is the last in line from farm and slaughterhouse and knows where the animals came from and has the carcasses hanging in a proper coldroom where they are properly butchered.

Then you have diet coke butchers. These are relatively unskilled butchers who don't really care where the animal is from but flog it on anyway.

null,null,Kbardo,null,null,null,"I may have to rescind that comment a bit. Only last year was he tops in assists for the Ukrainian Premier League. He was tops in both goals (15, 3 from pen) and assists (12). Not bad for only 25 games! Normally he has had 4 or 5 assists a season. Last year was his break out, at least in that category. Here's where I'm getting all this.

null,null,qwertyell,null,null,null,"First half was as bad as it was against Everton: shapeless, lethargic and defensively all over the place. Romeu was promising, but he and Wanyama were nowhere to be seen when Fonte's poor headed clearance fell to Sparv 20 yards out, slap bang in the middle of the pitch. 

I assume Koeman must've gotten into them at half time because the team suddenly started playing with pace, intensity and some urgency at last. Why it took so long for them to wake up, I don't know. But for 20 minutes after the break there, we almost had something resembling last season's Saints. 

But then they faded and ran out of ideas against a well organised defence. The last 30 minutes (I'm adding the injury time) was just hopeful and often hopeless long ball punts up to Pelle. Ultimately, it was pretty disappointing fare against modest opponents that didn't do anything to shake the feeling that this is going to be rough season. 

Positives: Targett bounced back well after a couple of horror shows. Ward-Prowse actually got quite involved for a few minutes there. Romeu was decent - though a fussier ref would've given him a second yellow for his continued lunging into challenges.

And Rodriguez, though not amazing, got his goal and seemed a little sharper.

Negatives: It's not exactly a ringing endorsement of the club's transfer dealings when the two right backs they've shelled out on are sat on the bench while Yoshida stinks the place up, out of position, in preference to either of them. 

Wanyama continues to look barely interested. The only things of note he did tonight were repeatedly launch cross-field passes straight into touch. 

Caulker was very QPR-sy in his defensive work. 

Shane Long. He's so crap it's unbelievable. He literally can't do anything other than run onto through balls through the middle. If he has to pass or dribble or exhibit any kind of basic footballing skill, he's out of his element. It was only cameo tonight, but he contributed nothing positive. Not a thing.
