null,null,joethepro36,null,null,null,"&gt;We should be letting them in with open arms and working on migrant integration.

Woah there, resources are finite and money doesn't grow on trees. The central point to why I am opposed to letting in x amount of migrants where x is above 100k a year is due to the lack of resources this country has to house people from other countries. We still have large levels of youth unemployment and housing crisis to deal with. We need to accept people into our country from wartorn areas yes, but this must be tempered with our ability to slowly integrate them into our society. Opening the floodgates and letting everyone in would likely cause an economic crisis in this country this time not caused by bankers.

Many of the migrants are economic migrants, they aren't people looking for safety or a house that's not going to be barrel bombed at random but just an easier, cushier life. People who think France and Germany are not good enough for them such as in Calais do not deserve a place here, they are freeloaders looking for an easier time at the taxpayers dime. The same kind that have a better smartphone than you or me and have spent more money travelling to Europe than I get in a year as a student. It is very important to make the distinction between these people and war refugees. Economic migrants are exploiting Europeans kindness in taking in those fleeing violence and genuine suffering.

Another aspect is the changing demography of the country. Many people including myself are opposed to a rapid demographic transformation caused by large scale immigration. Put simply I do not want the street I've had a home in since I was a little boy turned into something wildly different. I like the Indians and Africans who live there already but they are British citizens who've been there even longer than I have and I'm getting closer and closer to 30. A wave of immigration that changes my street into a neighbourhood of third worlders is not in my mind a good thing. Human beings or not I want the people living in my street to be of British culture. Assimilation takes a lot of time, at least a decade or two. The city centre of Cardiff has already changed dramatically since I was young, I don't want such changes to accelerate.

This morning I saw a picture of migrants holding up a banner asking the British people why their mothers didn't teach them to share. This is the mentality of people coming here (from Calais), they want our resources that are able to be taken. With youth unemployment still an issue it seems unlikely these people benefiting from our state services will be likely to just all find jobs the second they arrive, especially if their English is poor. A low level of genuine refugees able to assimilate and acclimatise to the country is the sensible and adult approach to take here. 

It's very easy to have a feel good mentality of ""oh lets take them all in, we need to care for our fellow humanity"" but its a lot harder to confront the truth of the cost of assimilation in monetary, demographic and cultural costs. Claiming putting up a fence is not an adult act is merely a cheap way of asserting that those who disagree with you are children and therefore their arguments can be ignored.

null,null,45ff,UnionFlag,,null,"16 year-old (early 80's) started an apprenticeship 5 miles from home with no public transport option. Mother (bless her) suggested a moped, so enter bike No1 a Honda C50L (cub).

All the other apprentices in my group (about 60 of us) had mopeds, so naturally we progressed to larger bikes at 17, so enter bike No2 a Honda CB100N (100cc single).
Fell in with the harder core of bikers, got kitted up and passed test, enter bike No3 a Honda CB250N Super Dream.

Now a real biker, hair grows and enter bike No4 a CB400N Super Dream. Loved that bike, started going to rallies (the camping + bands + silly games sort). 
Left home for University (in Coventry). Was on my way to a rally in Manchester when the 400 died. Got AAed to a nearby friends parents house (had them spread all over the country by now!). Couldn't fix it but friend had a friend who was selling a Honda CX500. This guy dropped the CX off and said I could try it out for a week and if I liked it could buy it. Loved it, so became mine.

Riding in all weathers and all year round I got fed up with being tense riding in the ice and fog, so enter another CX500 with a  Squire single seat sidecar. Now the winter became fun.

Picked up another CX for £100 just because. Now had a reputation :-)
After University started work and bought first house - or rather a large garage with house attached due to the number of bikes (still had a 250 and 400 super dream).

Met wife-to-be at a biker party - she was riding a Suzuki GP100 (100cc two-stroke) but had just passed her test. She fancied a Suzuki GS400 (400cc twin). The following weekend a mate in London phoned saying he'd come across a GS400 in a lock-up and was I interested? Too right I was! £80 for a bike that had been in storage for several years. Fixed the bike up for my lady (a great way to get her into my garage :-) ) who then became my wife.

Married life started of great, but them she injured her back at work (as a nurse) and was off sick for too many years. Got better so to celebrate we got rid of the old bikes and replaced them with a 3-year old Honda CBR1000F and a Ducati 600 Monster.  Life was great again. Got a bonus at work and bought a 1954 M100 Panther (600cc single). 

Then came first child and a car, but being a biker family the bikes stayed. An 850T3 Moto Guzzi with a larger sidecar became available, so bought that so we could still do bike shows, ride-outs, etc.

Then came 2nd, 3rd and 4th children. Sidecar too small. No time. But the bikes stayed, just waiting for their time to come again. 

Last year youngest was 5 years old so time for biking started to return. The Panther became my 'main' bike because even short journeys are fun. Guzzi was unreliable (electrics!) so replaced with a BMW K100 and chair.

Wife's hips started suffering so found holding a bike difficult, so sold the Monster and got a Suzuki 600N Bandit trike. I get to ride that too!

From experience - things change, so make the most of each day. Keep a bike (or bike-shaped space) in the garage because there will be time later for riding. A biker wife understands why you still need to ride.

1 'artisan' coffee shop, 
2 coffee shops part of the same local chain, 
1 tearoom, 
2 coffee-and-small-baked-goods place, 
1 Starbucks(Urgh).

And these don't even give you instant coffee either.

Why, that's not even counting going into the town centre itself, in these dazzling, shining times you can find yourself never more than three minutes from a Starbucks, two and a half from a Costa and in some parts, two feet from a Caffe Nero.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Thing is the USA just has so many guns,

Not really, lots of countries have per-capita levels of gun ownership similar to the US with far lower crime. What's also notable is that if you go down to a state level, many states with the highest per-capita ownership have much lower crime than states with low-ownership.

For instance, in highly rural states, every man and his dog will have one or more hunting rifles, and gun crime ain't bad. Go somewhere like Illinois (population dominated by Chicago), and firearms ownership is quite low on account of restrictive Cook County legislation, but gun crime is really high - because of organised inner-city crime.

In that comparison, people need to understand that no law will change that (just as it didn't in the UK post-1997). The only thing that will change it is Operation Trident-style enforcement projects in Chicago to bust the crime syndicates. There are lots of illegal guns in the US already (despite their relatively loose laws!) - making them more illegal is obviously a stupid and pointless thing that only a grandstanding politician would do. If they're already illegal, new laws won't help - you need to physically go out and take them off the streets.

What the US does lack is a system of licensing that effectively demarcates the white and black markets, and effectively keeps firearms out the hands of convicted felons and those with mental health issues (there's some background checking but it's far from perfect). In the UK (whose system is too strict^1, but that's another topic) firearms that *have ever been registered* are involved in less than 1% of UK gun crime. If you banned all private ownership of firearms, gun crime would continue utterly unabated - because people making guns on lathes in back-garden workshops, or smuggling them in from Eastern Europe don't really care!

The second part is parts of the US have a very weird cultural relationship with firearms, and talking about ""America with guns"" just indicates that people don't know enough to comment - because do you really think the ""gun culture"" in rural Alabama is the same as target shooters doing their thing in the LA Gun Club?

^1 The fundamental system in the UK is not bad, but it has a bunch of weird quirks that encumber firearm owners whilst doing *nothing* to actually protect public safety - like arbitrarily limiting the number of Guest Days a club can have in a year and putting some weird limits on rifle clubs that don't apply to shotgun clubs (because of disparities between Section 1&amp;2 firearms).",null,0,null,1440668366,null,null,1440668687,0,cuhadp0,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cugx8iv,null,null,null,1441525600,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You can be concerned with the impact of increasing populations (which is 100% reasonable, especially when there is a drastic shortfall in infrastructure funding - spending more would help the problem, but it wouldn't fix it) and still retain compassion for those not your own.

I look at the migration issues we see at the moment and I see a humanitarian crisis. It's a crisis because *none* of the solutions are humanitarian. If we (western Europe) accept them with open arms we *are* causing problematic knockon effects in our own regions and if we reject them we *are* abandoning those in need for our own selfish reasons.

The big issue here is that the wrong places are being forced to accept (or being asked to accept) these people. Western Europe is really very highly populated, but bits of it are less populated than other bits. Some countries, that don't seem interested in participating in the discussion, could happily afford to do more. We could probably do more to space out immigration in this country (a disproportionate number remain in London and the SE). And countries further afield could 100% do more. 

It seems strange to us, but some countries are in need of population increases. There are places where these immigrants wouldn't tax resources too greatly and would actually be a massive boon. Canada, for example, still runs a frontier programme - they are actively seeking people to go and live on the frontier, farm arable land and extend the borders of human expansion.

In truth I'd wanted a bike since I was 16 but neither the right amount of courage nor adequate finances allowed me to do so..

So I went out, found a fairly tidy YBR125 and bought. It arrived the Friday after my CBT (did my CBT on a Saturday) and I rode it around all weekend. Come Saturday it was cloudy again and I rode it 20 miles up into the Cotswolds to my old gliding club, just to get used to it. Was great. Rained again but I wasn't too fussed (and I guess my career as an all weather biker started right there and then!).

Did my theory test in November 2014 and my A2 in February 2015. Would you believe it, my Mod1 was after a weekend of heavy rain and my Mod2 was in the snow (yes, in March)! So all my assessed rides have been pretty much in the worst weather you could muster. Since November last year I've been riding 40 miles a day, almost everyday, only ever not riding when I've got the day off/on the rare occasion I am working from home. I quite enjoy the wet weather - makes things interesting - but getting soaked through to the skin is never fun.

Bought my CBF in March 2015 from my A2 instructor. Gorgeous machine and despite the ""issues"" it and I have had it remains a reliable steed to this day.

For instance, Cook County, Illinois (where Chicago is), has some really strict firearm laws.

Private firearm ownership is much lower and more complex than say, rural Alabama.

But Chicago has really high gun crime - much of it gang-on-gang, using black market firearms.

Making those guns more illegal isn't going to do squat. What they need is *enforcement of existing laws*.

For instance, firearms crime in the UK rose through the 90s and continued to rise even after Dunblane when handguns were banned - because only 1% of firearms crime actually involved legal firearms. Legislation was chasing a very much diminished return, since it could *at most* affect 1% of the problem, and ignored 99%!

Gun crime levels were not curtailed until 2004-5 when Operations Trafalgar and Trident started to take effect and clear serious quantities of black-market firearms (and their dealers) off the streets. Those guns were already held illegally pre-1997, the Police just weren't getting them off the streets.

They're not the same.

As tragic as they are, the death tolls from Virginia Tech or Sandy Hook (15, 20, even 50 - but on rare occasions) are statistically insignificant compared to the overall death rate (11,000 plus in 2011) that tots up from one murder here, one burglary-gone-bad there, etc.

Their cause is very different, and as such the responses required to curtail them are also different. In neither case is it as simple as ""fewer guns"". Legislation might be part of the problem but simply going ""moar gun control, lets ban them"" is at best only a small piece of the solution.

Your spree shootings are generally down to mental health issues, and sometimes a grudge to bear.

The most [lethal school massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster) in the US was actually the School Board Treasurer packing the walls of the school with explosives and blowing the place sky high (and then driving up and committing suicide with a car bomb which wiped out a lot of the rescuers searching through the rubble for the kids.

You can't expect a Texan rancher to accept federal laws written to address problems in inner cities. It's not relevant to him and he and his congressman aren't going to bend to them.

America is huge - that's why they have states, and counties, and why Chicago has more restrictive laws within Cook County than the rest of Illinois has at a state-legislature level.

Trying to compare the USA to the UK, or any European country (as many in this thread have done) is ridiculous, because the USA is only really a legal construct. It's too big and diverse to expect a federal law to be capable of addressing the variety of problems they have.

The problem is that there is not always the will or finance at a local level to instigate the local-level solutions that are required.

By way of example, check out [this data](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls).

In 2010, there were 12996 murders, of which 8775 were with firearms.

More than 1200 of them were in California - the most restrictive anti-gun state in the USA (because much of it stems from LA and gang violence - which only *enforcement* can address, not more laws).

Similarly, the District of Columbia had 99 firearm murders, which per capita is really bad - especially considering they're also a very restrictive jurisdiction. Same for New York, Pennsylvania and Chicago.

The vast majority of America's firearm crime come from a small collection of largely urban, inner-city areas, which is why it seems all the more ridiculous when the first thing they show to illustrate ""America's Gun Problem"" is a hunter in Idaho, rather than a drug dealer in the Bronx.",null,0,null,1440671162,null,null,1440671771,0,cuhb11f,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cugwjtl,null,null,null,1441525906,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

How about we do the unthinkable and put foreign aid to good use by setting up camps in Lebanon and Jordan to help with the massive sea of migrants who are going over there already (over one mIllion at last count) so they don't come over to Europe. The reason why they're coming over to Europe isn't because they want to take our jobs and simultaneously live off the state whilst turning the country into the very place they fled from. It's because they left everything in Syria and Iraq and they believe they'll get work, a house and a bit of money to start a new life from scratch. That might not all be true though, but lets stop pretending these people are fleeing from Shangri La and deal with this Crisis in a way that isn't kneejerk and in denial of the actual root cause.

If you want to stop these migrants from coming over here, then we should get our fingers out:

1. Stop pissing about with Assad and accept him for the psychopathic murderer he is.
2. Stop pissing about with ISIS and work harder to crush those childfuckers.
3. Set up camps in Neighbouring countries to not just house these people, but to keep them fed, watered and their children educated. We can do this with the foreign aid budget. You know, that 0.3 Million that we pretend is something like 3.0 billion?
4. Go over to Calais, and, with permission from the French, process these asylum seekers. In reality, there's only about 4000 of them there and there's plenty of them who are deserving, genuine asylum seekers. The ones who are genuine get sent into group housing, then ones who aren't get told to fuck off.

Or does that sound like too much work compared to shutting the borders, pretending Syria is a wonderland and the people trying to get in here are Satanic Benefits Smugglers. The other countries in the EU are doing their bit to deal with this problem but, much to their annoyance, we're barely lifting a finger.",null,1,null,1440672441,null,null,false,0,cuhbcvb,null,t3_3ik5ko,null,null,null,t1_cuhar8d,null,null,null,1441526060,null,4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

## Raises the bar

Seen American TV? Want us to descend into that mire? Minimum of 18 minutes of commercials in each hour? Horrible shouty (Faux/Fox) news full of propaganda?

Without the BBC, the competition stops having to provide a credible alternative. The only way you'll get quality television is to pay for it - the likes of Netflix and HBO will love it.

I have issues with the recent quality of the BBC too. Their news coverage of late has been very very lenient on the incumbent government, no doubt because they fear being shut down by them.

Recently they've had to bear the brunt of paying for £750M worth of free TV licenses, presumably because the government wanted to make sure they remembered that they should toe the line.

That's more than their entire radio budget. Someone really wants them to receive the message.

## Good Value

For our £12.50 a month we get

* 8 national TV channels
* 7 national radio stations
* Local radio
* The BBC website
* iPlayer

The beauty of content is that the more people can access it, the more valuable it is.

Imagine what you could produce if the USA had a public broadcaster funded the same way - five times the population, five times the content. The commercial media guys have probably imagined the same thing, and shat their collective pants, which is why they have such a raging hard-on to destroy it.

There's no reason to expect absolute undying loyalty from people for life.

It's not about building around a striker, it's about basic effort in making yourself dangerous to the defence. You don't have to be Suarez, but you definitely can't be Balotelli. He lacked the basic intelligence to link up with any players.

They don't. They did, but prior to the 2012 Olympics the Home Office struck a deal with British Shooting to nominate up to 25 athletes for Section 5 permits to keep their pistols in the UK for training. There are some fairly onerous restrictions on them regarding storage and approved ranges for training, but they can train in the UK again.

&gt; And how Scotland is about to require a Firearms Certificate to own an air rifle.

Absolutely. Because Neds won't just drive south of the border and buy an unlicensed air rifle from an English shop? It's ridiculous. And all because a junkie accidentally shot the son of the dealer who sold him the drugs he was high on, whilst he was trying to take pot-shots at firefighters.

&gt; I mean, the Channel Islands still allows handguns, and they've been fine.

And the Isle of Man. Dunblane was actually not a failure of the law, but a failure of Policing - the official report even said so. Hamilton lied on his license applications, which should have got him immediately disqualified. In 30 years this was never picked up! These days, the National Firearms Licensing System being tied into the Police National Computer means such oversights are all but impossible. The Police *always* check if someone is actually a member of the club they claim to be with. His deception would be found out straight away, and even if it weren't, he would have been arrested and charged for any number of other infractions and irregularities which were allowed to slide in the 1970s and 80s and highlighted in the Cullen Report.

We should absolutely be able to keep sport pistols in the UK for target shooting again. Subject to proper licensing and storage of course, they would pose no risk to public safety.

In a perfect world that would be the case, but I would say that a lot of comments across the whole of reddit get downvoted because people disagree with them rather than the quality of the content.

&gt;By and large there aren't really problematic biases apparent. Just like how the BBC gets accusations from all sides of being biased, which really shows in the end they aren't that biased at all.

Again, I disagree here. In my own experience (which I understand counts for less than even the surveys we're discussing!) there does seem to be a nationalist bias in the sub. Also any calls of bias here that I've seen have been for that supporting nationalists, and rarely, if ever, claiming that there's a unionist bias, which rules out the BBC analogy.

&gt;All that we need to measure the community balance on /r/northernireland[2] is two options.

Again, this is what we keep coming back to and disagreeing on. Even if every visitor to the sub responded to this survey and answered truthfully it still doesn't give any information to the 'nationalist bias' that we're talking about. It's how vocal and likely to vote a user, or population of users is that establishes the bias, *not how many users there are*.

Insurance: You would ideally have to have yourself as a named driver on someone else's insurance with special permission to only use the bike under instruction, radio etc. Trying to get your own insurance for a bike you can't legally ride tends to result in instant refusal. You are only required to sign a declaration of insurance at the test centre not produce the certificate.

Transport: Easiest way would be to have someone drop the bike off for you, otherwise you would need to tow it with a car.

Booking the test: Obviously it's really easy to book the tests yourself but you will find training schools reserve/book test slots well in-advance so there may not be any availability for a long time.

I dunno, lets find out...

Robots are unlikely to take over for at least a couple of years, so lets go off the future minimum wage just announced in the most recent budget (£9 p/h)...

So you're paying some guy £9 an hour for 8 hours a day 52 weeks a year. That's £18720. Add on employer's NI contributions and we're a touch over [£20000](http://www.icalculator.info/employer_NIC_calculator/18720.html) per minimum wage employee (That's just in wages, the actual costs of employing someone are actually far higher as you have management costs, recruitment costs, allowances for sick days, cover for holidays, etc).

We'll just use the basic wage figure though, since the management costs are analogous to your technician costs of running an automated workforce, recruitment costs would be analogous to installation costs of an automated system.

In that yearly period a full-time employee working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week will work 1856 hours after holiday deductions (actual time worked will be 46.4 weeks). Again, this is under the assumption that all our employees are perfect human specimens who never get sick or need any days off apart from their statutory holiday entitlement.

Theoretically, a robot will be capable of working near 24 hours a day... 8736 hours a year. But lets be generous and assume 10% downtime for maintenance.

So for a single robot that gives us 7862 hours of work every year for a one off cost of $100-150k (£65-97k).

For an equivalent human workforce to do an equivalent amount of hourly work you'd need almost 4.25 humans which would have an *annual* cost of £85000.

[2014](http://cdn.celticfc.net/assets/downloads/Celtic_Report_2014.pdf):

&gt;Group revenue decreased by 14.6% to £64.74m (2013: £75.82m), in part due to the £100 reward on season tickets. 

&gt;Operating expenses (excluding exceptional operating expenses) decreased by 4.5% to £59.89m (2013: £62.71m). 

&gt;Investment in football personnel of £8.07m (2013: £9.67m). 

&gt;Year end net cash at bank £3.83m (2013: £3.76m) 

&gt;Exceptional costs of £4.66m (2013: £1.83m).

&gt;Profit before tax £11.17m (2013: £9.74m).

&gt;New long-term bank facility agreement.

Without player sales (£17.5m) Celtic would have been £6m in the hole for 2014. Which interestingly enough isn't far off the ""multimedia"" earnings Celtic lost (£5.2m) from their poor CL performance last season. Celtic also lost out on £4m from lower stadium ticket sales last season and lost £1.4m from merch.

Celtic might be in an uncomfortable position but it's easily remedied with a few factors. 1: More friendlies and exhibition matches. 2: More variation in merch, including the return of the third and/or special kits.

All you have to do is look at the most downvoted parent comments on political threads. The most upvoted submission, Ian Paisley's death, is a good indicator. The downvoted comments are both blatantly unionist and nationalist.

If you want to insist on claiming there's a nationalist bias, do you want me to claim there's a unionist bias and we'll call it even? Bloody hell, claiming there's a bias doesn't actually mean anything.

&gt;Again, this is what we keep coming back to and disagreeing on. Even if every visitor to the sub responded to this survey and answered truthfully it still doesn't give any information to the 'nationalist bias' that we're talking about.

Now what's the bloody lack of reliability in these kinds of surveys? They're very reliable. This subreddit has 6,000 subscribers, a sample size of a few hundred is pretty good for that.

If you're claiming that the voting and commenting is done more often by nationalists, all you're conceding is that unionists couldn't give a shit about anything, and that's a rather sectarian accusation to be making ay?

Honestly, go ahead and make a poll asking nationalists and unionists to vote for how often they vote on comments and submissions. It's a fucking ridiculous idea, but it won't take you that long.

The whole of the Middle east isn't in turmoil. Lebanon and Jordan are both relatively peaceful countries that a good chunk of the refugees are fleeing to, but they need help dealing with them. If this country helps these countries they will be less likely to come over here, and isn't that what you want? I hate to break this to you but when there's a war in a country, the last thing on the minds of civilians there are ""Oh, the people in country x will be inconvenienced by us fleeing our country. Oh well, I guess we'll just stay here and get the shit bombed out of us. Maybe if we're lucky we'll get killed!""

Also, we kinda played a role in the situation that lead up to this clusterfuck, didn't we? In iraq we overthrew a minority Sunni Regime that abused the Shia majority which, after we rebuilt the country politically, went on to take revenge on the Sunnis who then formed groups to go around killing shias that eventually became the Islamic fucking State.

We should help the people fleeing Syria and Iraq because A) They can't help themselves, B) It would mean less of them coming over to Britain and therefore less of a strain on our country and C) because we pretty much had a role in this big clusterfuck to begin with.

Or would you rather keep going with the situation we have now? You know, the situation that you keep raging about saying that we should just chase them away? You admit the situation in Syria and Iraq is a clusterfuck but you pretend all these people at our doorstep are somehow fleeing from somewhere like Moldova, poor, yet ultimately peaceful. Do you want this ""swarm"" coming over here, or do you want them to stay in the neighbouring countries like everyone seems to say they should?

- Good gear is a must. Having the right kit so you stay warm and dry underneath does really help your confidence. I can't state that enough.

- You will find that (as long as they are a good brand/model) the tyres should have more grip in the wet than you give them credit for. Watch out for when it's really pouring and there is a film of water over the road as that can be a bit nasty, other than that though as long as you're not pushing too hard round the corners you will be fine

- Sometimes it's inevitable that you will hit a drain or something similar in the wet, if you feel the bike lose traction keep calm as you pass over it and the slide hits the edge you will regain control. Basically it feels like a little wobble or slide, if it happens - you will be fine.

- The worse case scenario if riding sensibly should be (ignoring the usual non weather related dangers) you come off whilst going round a corner at sensible speed wearing the correct gear. Not pleasant but not the end of the world. Don't let the fear of something, which even if it happens isn't actually that bad, put you off riding in the wet. Being an all weather biker is great fun and means you get so much more time in the saddle!

- Finally, I actually enjoy riding in shit weather if I've got the right gear on and it's no longer than an hour.

Last year I was in exactly your situation. The best thing that I did was go and talk to [[Smith and Williamson](https://www.smith.williamson.co.uk)] who provided a lot of advice about my possible options. In the end I chose a self managed ISA, putting my 15k allowance in when possible, and left the rest of the money to be managed by them.

So far they have been really professional and helpful, and perhaps most importantly generated me decent, safe returns through a mixture of cash holdings, bonds, stocks, and ETFs. This amount of money is not something to be trifled with, and blindly investing it into property as some others have suggested is probably  not wise.

Please, please, do arrange a free consultation with Smith and Williamson or another firm who provide wealth management services. They will talk you through your available options - it really was the best thing for me personally. I'm also fairly certain that £150,000 is enough for a financial advisor :)

Well people are being vetted on the basis of whether they support the aims and values of the Labour Party, which is a rather vague term. I bet this fellow could make an impassioned argument going to an illegal war in the ME was not supporting the values and aims of the Labour Party, since that seems to be why he left (you're implying he voted Labour until 2005).

He also discontinued his Green membership, which is the only reason I would exclude anybody from voting - membership in another party. He paid his three quid, so he should get to vote.

null,null,BrotoriousNIG,eng-lancashire,Salford,null,"The US Army/Air Force/etc. is made up of people, not robots.  People are much more likely to disobey an order to carpetbomb Cleveland because most households have guns and they've all just rallied in town square, with their guns, against the government, than they are to disobey an order to attack a group of 'loner gun-nuts' in a society where almost everyone has longsince given up their firearms.

In the event of rebellion, a nation of people who can fight back and do are much more likely to have the US armed forces fragment between their two allegiances than a nation of people who can't fight back, and so don't, which gives the impression of being alright with the situation, which makes those who are fighting back appear more like isolated lunatics than 21st Century Minutemen.

The alternative - trying to make the US army less powerful - is pretty much impossible.  Politics is now almost impenetrable to the average person, and that's assuming you can find someone who wants to run; someone who isn't already completely disillusioned by the whole thing.  Even Bernie Sanders, who seems to be the only person on the ballot actually standing for ordinary people, with a list of donors that doesn't include multibillion dollar multinationals and members of the militaryindustrial complex, and a voting record to point to to prove where he's at on the issues, seems destined to lose in the face of overwhelming financial backing of neoliberal candidates like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.  His one hope is to replicate the kind of grassroots support that Obama had, but that's harder for an old white man to do than a relatively young black community organiser behind whom almost an entire demographic was behind from Day One.

So if you wanted to get into politics and make a change, you have all that to fight, and you've got to keep your integrity in the face of donors trying to buy your political favour, and have no secrets to hide, nothing bad that can be brought out to kill your campaign, because if you do, and you're running on a platform of personal freedom and reducing the size of the armed forces, the NSA will see themselves as a potential target of yours, they will find your secrets, they will give them to Fox News, and your campaign is over. Shit, if it turns out you're a saint with no skeletons in the closet they might even David Kelly you.

So you only have petitions and protests at your disposal.  Except, petitions are routinely responded to with empty political rhetoric - de facto ignored - and protests are met with agents provocateurs and artificially escalated into 'hostile rioters clashing with police'.

There is nothing you can do, as a citizen, to make a difference or try to fight the militaryindustrial complex.  This is why a lot of people feel that the best idea is to own guns, just in case, and if it kicks off hope that more of the armed forces side with the People than the State.  We in Europe, with our lower levels of inequality and other social problems, can call the 2nd Amendment outdated as much as we like, and pretend that's the problem, but the facts of the matter are:

The general population isn't armed, but there is a real terrorism threat, and they need to have sidearms with them just in case. PSNI officers are incredibly disciplined and trained though, I have nothing but the utmost respect for them.

At the same time, you can't disarm US police until the population is disarmed - and that isn't happening any time soon either. A disarmed police service works on the mainland because there's such a low amount of people who can carry firearms, there really isn't that much of a danger and the police can get away with a non-lethal armament because they don't need a sidearm for protection - what's the chances of a traffic stop with a guy who has a pistol in the glove box? Pretty low.

In the US though, the amount of guns around is pretty staggering. If, by some act of God, the US federally mandates that police forces should be disarmed, it wouldn't be good at all. Police officers would be in very grave danger, I believe. This [video - (Warning: Guy gets shot and killed at very close range, not really NSFL but just a heads up)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySkPsKoTWeg) is the perfect example of why police officers in the US *need* to be armed. This case was a suicide by cop, I believe and the gun was a replica - however, it's probably the best example I've seen of how good training and discipline can save a cops life (not to mention body cams and how they can get you off the hook). I realize that I'm cherry-picking here, but imagine if these officers just had tazers/batons on them and the guy's weapon was real and loaded. Chances are we'd be watching the death of two cops on their own body cams. They could have tazered him - actually, the other officer initially drew her tazer, but couldn't fire because her parter would still be in danger if the weapon as loaded. [Here's another video of a ""routine"" traffic stop where the driver was armed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irPrIAVnjqU). Again, if the officer is disarmed, he's dead in that situation. Armed response units can't help in either of these scenarios. There's nothing stopping a driver saying ""Officer, I have to tell you that I have a weapon in this vehicle.."" and the officer would probably have procedures in place to handle it. It's perfectly legal in the states and I'm sure it happens every day, and I'm sure officers would appreciate your honesty. If you're stupid enough to brandish your weapon during a traffic stop like that guy, I have no sympathy.

Bottom line is that if police forces were disarmed, it wouldn't end well. It's a different story for mall cops etc., but not for police officers. Again, I realize that I cherry picked two videos with decent, well trained and disciplined officers, but I think they work well as examples. I'm not going to even discuss bad cops I'm not going down that rabbit hole. I honestly believe that taking weapons from US police officers only creates more problems that they solve.

&gt;Well people are being vetted on the basis of whether they support the aims and values of the Labour Party, which is a rather vague term

It is indeed a bit vague. But the thing everyone seems to forget is that it's AIMS and values. Values is all that woolly stuff about making the world a better place in ways that we find agreeable. Aims is rather more straight forward- one of Labour's stated constitutional aims is to get representatives elected in democratic elections. While a Green Party die hard might feasibly claim that they support Labour's values, they categorically cannot claim to support its aims. They could show that they support its aims in an extremely easy way- by placing that X on their ballot paper next to the Labour candidate, something which a third of the population managed to do without issue. If you're one of the two thirds of the electorate that thought another party's candidate should be elected ahead of Labour's, that's fine and dandy and perfectly allowed- but it does make you ""not a supporter"" by any sane definition.

There are also a huge swathe of jobs that will not be automated even if we had the means such as care worker, teacher, security guards, police and some high end hospitality and retail jobs. Plus cleaning will probably be one of the last to go.

We're likely to head towards a future we a few very well educated people can run most of the stuff and there's a whole boat load of jobs that are well below degree level in requirements and don't pay a huge amount. Meaning a couple of things: tax revenue will need to come from the rich, and the economy will slow as consumer demand disappears.

What we need to do is get rid of the idea that some jobs aren't worth not just a living wage, but a middle class one. We also need a culture shift higher up so that rather than working 1 person to the bone 80 hours a week and paying them well, you work 2 people for 40 hours and pay them reasonably.

&gt;  Aims is rather more straight forward- one of a Labour's stated constitutional aims is to get representatives elected in democratic elections. While a Green Party die hard might feasibly claim that they support Labour's values, they categorically cannot claim to support its aims. 

If they're registering for the election they aren't a diehard. They can still argue they would support its aims if they can support the values laid forth by Corbyn.

The divisions in the North came as a result of the Government of the day and their various 'organisations' declaring war on the 'other side'.

One side started the majority of conflict here citing democracy and civilisation as their defense for oppression and murder.  Now that the majority of 'those ones' (to be fair this applies to both sides) have all but packed away the guns and bombs etc and are now using the same methods of democracy and civilised society to end the status-quo here, there is dissent.

Just look at the difference between the ""Buy"" and ""Sell"" rates for foreign exchange and it's obvious that that represents any fees etc. Surely people shop around, looking for the best ""buy"" and ""sell"" rates - personally I prefer these to represent the full cost rather than my then having to find whatever commission there is on top, making the maths/comparison more complex. The cost of forex isn't ""hidden"" in my opinion - instead it's a % of your transaction, folded into the rate. 

It's no different to having a price on goods at a shop which includes taxes (so you know what you're paying at the till - as in the UK), or which do not (and so your 99c item cost $1.17 or whatever at the till - the US approach). Personally I vastly prefer the former.

Of more complexity/impact is that the exchange rates quoted at most retail places are negotiable. They quote x but you can often negotiate them up/down - their computer systems will make a yes/no decision on the rate you suggest. This is partially for price-matching reasons with their competitors. So people who are willing to negotiate may get a 1-2% difference in rate.

Ultimately though, if you're daft enough to not shop around, and not realise that the difference between buy and sell rates is largely their profit margin, then that's your problem.

null,null,Patch86UK,null,Labour Member,null,"All of those things are policies. They are not what anyone is talking about. Plenty of people inside the party disagree with those policies, either in whole or in detail. Aims and Values refers to the constitution of the Labour Party. It has a whole section called ""Aims and Values"" (Clause IV). It also lists aims elsewhere in the constitution (notably Clause I, which specifies the Party's main purpose is to seek election for those who represent its values in democratic elections), and detailed knock-out criteria for would-be members.

If you are someone who actively campaigned to keep Labour representatives out of power at the last election (by working for another party), you are not a Supporter. That's not to say that you're a bad person, or that you can't change your mind, and that if you start working towards Labour's aims today you'll be more than considered a Supporter in a few months time. But today, right now, you are not one. 

To put this in to context, voting for Labour in 2015 seems like it would have been a great way to gauge support. By that measure, a third of the entire British electorate, some 9.5 million people, would be able to qualify as Labour supporters. If you were one of the two thirds of the population who chose to vote against Labour, that's fair enough; but you can't expect to be treated as a Labour Supporter in sensitive internal elections.

You're a Green Party member. How would you feel if in the next Green Party Leadership election, thousands of centrist, war-loving, pro-GM, free marketeers signed up yo vote? None of them have ever voted Green before, but they all swear that they support the Green's values (just think those environmentalist values would be better achieved by taking the party in a direction radically different to what long-term Green members think). Would you be OK with that, or do you think ""actually liking the Green Party"" might be a decent first criteria for being allowed to vote?",null,0,null,1440677499,null,null,false,0,cuhcxpa,null,t3_3ida0m,null,null,null,t1_cug27dq,null,null,null,1441526805,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

You can't fake it completely, because one day the guy whose head you just hacked off will be seen walking around by someone. If we assume the quick death offer theory is true, once the poor sap has said his piece, it still makes sense to cut his head off in as gory a fashion as possible right there on camera.


You have to look at the intended audience. The videos which are ultra-violent are in Arabic and made to instil fear in their local enemies and project the idea that they are powerful.

The Jihadi John videos are made for young western Muslims, many of whom have lived sheltered lives. It will be far more effective as a recruitment/propaganda tool to not show the actual beheading. Once they are captured in the idea of the 'glorious caliphate' it is far easier to accept the gruesome reality and for that they need videos like the one under discussion to first get them listening.


&gt;But we still come back to the lack of blood, which seems to suggest something was off.

Go and get a knife and press it up against your skin. Blood doesn't just shoot out. If they were going to do the beheading off camera why would they start actually slicing the throat?

It is also very possible that Jihadi John didn't have the stomach to do it himself and was merely a propaganda tool.",null,0,null,1440678219,null,null,false,0,cuhd7gv,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cuguqo7,null,null,null,1441526932,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

2. Most BTL lenders won't allow a family-member to live in the property. Think about it from their perspective; if your brother stopped paying the rent, would you really be prepared to turf him out onto the street?

3. BTL mortgages tend to look at 80% Loan To Value maximum. Ignoring the other issues, this would require a deposit of ~£60,000. There would also be conveyancing, survey fees, product fees and stamp duty to pay on the purchase.

The Broom-Handle Insertion Law(or as it's officially known, The Greased Object Obfuscation Act 1923) was put in place shortly after the First World War due to a fear of 'loosening stiff upper-lips' according to then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stanley Baldwin.

The law was swiftly passed thanks to the Conservative majority, though they were helped along by some Labour rebels who, according to Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald, ""were scared of looking like a bunch of blasted ninnies"".

However, shortly after the Labour victory in 1945 the law was amended to allow for some leeway as detailed in the Beveridge Report, and in the immortal words of Nye Bevan, to broker the deal he ""stuffed the arseholes with lube"".

As a side note, the law remained unchanged until 1985 when Margaret Thatcher sold off the broom handles(The lubricant having dried up despite rationing during the Three-Day Week) and these days we have a wide range of different styles and fashions to choose from.",null,0,null,1440678447,null,null,false,0,cuhdam3,null,t3_3iko96,null,null,null,t3_3iko96,null,null,null,1441526974,null,13,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13,null

Mario hasn't said that Rodgers should have done things differently to accommodate him, he's just pointing out that the tactics used didn't suit him. It's one of the reasons, along with his own shortcomings that he admits to, that things haven't worked out for him at LFC.

Lived 2 years in UK (Cambrige), among A LOT other spaniards (not only in Cambridge but everywhere in the UK).
I noticed that, after living there 2 years and meeting hundreds of immigrants from Spain, ANY of them was unemployed, and they all moved to UK for work (as you might know, we have around 50% of youth unemployment rate in spain)

I have met amazing british people and most of them were really nice, but I have met a few that did not want to work at all and blamed the immigrants for not being able to find a job. That, my friends, is completely bullshit, but they just complained and never printed a CV. Complaining and blaming the immigrants is too easy while sitting on the couch.

PS. I'm not saying that british are lazy or anything, they can be a minority, but it's something I notice
PS2. I don't know how it is in the rest of the UK, but in a busy city like Cambridge, if you WANT to work, you find a job in less than a week (obviously I'm not talking about qualified jobs, they take longer)

null,null,chadkaplowski,null,null,null,"If you tell the insurers that the car resides in a different place in order to gain a lower premium, you are getting a lower premium by deception, and therefore committing fraud. This is true of any piece of false information you give to achieve the same end, is a criminal act and can be referred for prosecution.

You might get away with it - usually these things will only come to light if you have to make a claim. In that instance the act the insurers take depends on type of lie and the type of claim. Most usually, they will charge you the difference between what you should have paid, and what you did pay, which in this case sounds like it might make any claim pointless (if the difference is a couple of grand). If the insurers deem the false information to be material to the risk or claim, that is, if they would either have refused to give you a policy had you given the right info, or if the claim is as a result of whatever you lied about, they can void your policy in it's entirety, refunding your premium and refusing to meet any claim obligations.

Consider as well that all insurance companies use interfaces with Experian (yes, the credit referencing/Big Brother agency) to check the details you give, at the time of taking out the policy AND when you make a claim.

Your call, but for me, I've never seen the benefit in trying to lie to insurers.

I don't understand how this isn't a bigger scandal. I hope it won't be swept under the rug. Ian Duncan-Smith has blood on his hands. Help the rich, fuck the poor and disabled. Wonderful. I live in continental Europe right now, I left the UK in 2007 while Labour was still in power. I don't really follow politics in the country I live in since I can't vote.

I feel powerless watching the UK being destroyed by greed and bigotry, it's making me feel like I don't ever want move back there. 

So what can we do about this? Petitions seldom do much. The Tories are masters of spin and coverup. The fact that they fought to keep this information secret from the public is telling of a regime which recognises its own evil and knows its doing work against the good of the population.

Of course the Daily Mail is reporting that the numbers have been fudged, but they have also barred commenting on that article, for obvious reasons - they are reporting the opposite to almost every other source and dissenting opinions are unwanted. Even the average Daily Mail readers wouldn't stand for this level of blatant cruelty, in my opinion.

I am British, but fortunate to have travelled extensively in Europe and America. Trying to draw a single line over 320million people in a country that is basically it's own continent is problematic. Only 80% of Americans speak English as their first language. There are massive disparities that don't exist, or exist to a much smaller extent in the UK.

That's why the EU doesn't pass laws so much as they pass resolutions which member nations are required to implement via their own legislation. Because we're standardising but allowing for localisation as well.

null,null,MrBeardyMan,null,null,null,"I left school at 16 (I had the grades for A levels, but hated school) and did a one year intensive ~~drinking~~ computer science course in ~~the pub opposite~~ a collage. That got me into uni aged 17, in the late 90s. The course was a very much not what I wanted to be doing, after my first year I worked out I'd used a computer for ~8 hours a week on average. *Used*. So I left and went to find work.

I wasn't sure what field I wanted to work in within IT, so I spent a several years bumming around doing desktop support work, gradually picking up more and more work at the server and network end.

After a few years I found myself drafted into a company my father was somewhat involved in who had just bought themselves out of a collapsed group. Few employees, little money, a non-functioning ""network"" (i.e. the machines existed but were not even plugged in) but client contracts to service. After a few weeks I'd got the network sorted but it soon became clear that ""the system"" they had bought to continue servicing their contract was little more than a broken access database full of VB script. No money for a programmer, so I was asked to ""take a look"".

Over the next few years I gradually reduced my support work and did more programming and learned more and more Linux sysadmin to support what I was writing. Decided I wanted a regular cheque and got a small web agency to hire me as a programmer, also covering their basic Linux sysadmin needs.

After a year or so there I wanted to move on (the pay was crap, bosses were worse) - applied for a web application programming job in the financial services world which required a degree. Had an interview, took a tech test, got hired.

Year on so after that I was not happy at the firm and totally done with the whole ""commute into London"" thing, applied for a job with a more local firm. Job listing said a degree was required; had an interview, took a tech test, hired. (Still there ... woah over 9 years now?!)

By the time you have *any* sort of work history you can apply for junior roles (the proven ability to just show up at a job is the first plus point).

I watch all American sports and understand those very well so if there's some correlation/ similarities between the two (with NFL, NBA, MLB or NHL) I would understand it, but the transfer window has been kind of confusing to me. 

As I understand, teams ""sell"" their players for cash (as opposed to trading like they do in the US), but these players are still ""owned' by the team that still sold them. Does that mean said team can ask for that player back? Is it  always for 1 year only or can it be longer? What is the advantages for selling a player? I understand you get money in return, but do you use that money to then loan out other players from other teams?

I am just surprised that the ID checks and/or the credit checks are more thorough in her case.  I was expecting that I had to do these things.

In no way, shape or form did we go from a ""US-like"" system to a ""UK-like"" system overnight, which is what you said.

In 1988 certain classes of firearm were moved to section 5. The same happened in 1997. In neither case did the actual licensing system change.

Licensing has been a slow, drip-feed system starting with pistol and later shotgun licences in the early 20th Century, which were simple bits of paper you bought from a Post Office much like a rod licence - they existed to price out the poorest from firearms ownership out of fear of Bolshevik Revolution in the UK.

There were various bits of law until licensing as we would recognise it came into place via the 1968 Firearms Act. It was established that to own a firearm you needed ""Good Reason"".

Self Defence was not considered ""Good Reason"", which left Target Shooting and Hunting - so even by 1968 we were well adrift of a US-style regime.

There were bits and pieces but the next major revision came - as you say - in 1988, with semi-autos and pump actions, as well as fiddling with explosive ammunition - which was not exactly a big part of the extant shooting sports.

Then came 1997, and they did away with pistols - in two stages of course. First centre-fire (before the election), then rimfire also (after the election). They also moved expanding ammunition to Section 5, which was perplexing as this stood in direct contradiction with the Deer Act which stated that only expanding ammunition was considered suitable and humane for game and pest shooting! So the Home Office had to put out some ""Guidance"" before the law was even enacted stating that it would be permissible for quarry shooting, but not target - which says something about the quality of legislation that was being passed.

So I'm not sure which ""overnight"" this 60 year cornucopia of legislation refers to. It didn't happen overnight. It happened over decades.

If we're arguing that America should tighten it's laws, you can't say ""Well the UK did it overnight"" - because the UK *didn't*. Such a statement is at best misleading, at worst an outright lie.

The only reason the 1988 or 1997 Amendments could even *be* enacted was because a licensing system existed, and had done for long enough to be useful. If you passed a handgun ban in America - well good luck going house-to-house. You don't have a nice big list of who has what where you can tick off the guns as they are handed in. You're entirely relying on honesty, which means the crims - and any formerly law-abiding citizens disenfranchised with this turn of events - will not bother themselves and will tuck their guns away, safe in the knowledge that no one knows they have them.

Personally I found them on the whole to be quite slow paced and spent no more than a day (8 hours) per week on doing the modules (plus occassional attendance at evening tutorials). I got a DipComp and then stopped. More recently I did https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn and got ""100% with distinction"" based on working one evening a week (watching the vids at 1.5 times speed); I say that as a comparison.

In short, compared to my physics and maths college work previously I found it easy to do in much less time than they suggested. I'd say it is hard if you're working full-time too, more from motivation and that my job had a lot of reading already.

My courses all had TMAs; IIRC you had to pass all the TMAs but the final mark was mainly on the exam which was held in local government buildings. To complete the degree one had to do a course that included a longer project but that may have changed. Tutors were great but the range of abilities at tutorials was a bit frustrating, they helped me in making sure I kept up so that I'd done the work in advance of it being discussed at the tutorial. I'd rank tutorials as a good way to meet new friends; the rest of the course could feel quite solitary, they had a system of message boards (using a funky virtual campus) which I imagine has improved and probably now you might get access to tutors with video-messaging.

One thing I found a bit frustrating was that they insisted on some modules using Smalltalk, this may have changed, which isn't widely used in industry.

Let's stick 1,000 acres in Birmingham, dotted around the outskirts in little developments so no one notices.

&gt;I mean seriously. Where do uber-liberals suggest we build another Manchester? How do you pay for it? Because **a Manchester filled with largely unskilled immigrants sure as hell isn't going to have the same productivity as highly skilled Manchester.**

BBC R&amp;D still does some good things, but it's not the world leader it once was - it used to design and make a lot of the kit it needed, now someone else (probably in the private sector) has already designed and built it. The BBC contributes to DVB and other standards but it doesn't lead

On the specific issue of HD, this is the broadcaster that liked to use a weird resolution (1440x1080 or something like that), and later on, they kept decreasing bitrates to save money and squeeze more channels on. They claim that new encoders could do more with less, but others claim that there is a demonstrable difference in quality

There were arguments for both resolutions. I think some US broadcasters went for 720p as progressive was better for sports coverage, for example

On digital radio, they've done the same - they think 128k MP2 or less is acceptable. The only exception is Radio 3, but that's only because enough people were very vocal when the BBC tried to knock it down to 128k too. This is not that much different from the commercial broadcasters who have done the same. A truly leading broadcaster would be lobbying Ofcom to let them use DAB+ and AAC

null,null,Upright__Man,null,null,null,"&gt; the majority of EU migrants are in unskilled jobs 

Please share source proving that claim.  But assuming this is the case, then that's great!  We are getting better value for money (which typically equates to higher productivity - something we sorely need)

&gt; this means the supply of unskilled labour increases. 

no... they are (better) skilled (education).  Basic logic here.  The supply of people filling unskilled jobs increases (IF the above point is true, else irrelevant)

&gt; This means the corporations are less likely to increase the wage or working conditions. Supply and demand. 

Economics is much more complicated than Supply and Demand.  It's a basic principle, but to assume that's the end of it is naïve.  

Here is a link, please read and especially the links to studies.  Labour is elastic for a start, and we don't have x amount of jobs and then that's it.  As more people are employed more jobs are created (support jobs if you will).  

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/29/migrants-wages-uk-immigration_n_5409319.html

Lastly, which is all I really need to say to end this discussion.  Our unemployment is very low right now.  Indeed it is below target set by the BoE of 7%.   If supply and demand was the only variable then wages should already be going up (indeed they finally are just above 2008 levels but just recently, and rises are slower than they should be).   Without EU immigration our GDP would be *considerably* lower.

So that's it, if you want to continue please share respected source/study...

Experience is a player's ability to be in the right place at the right time.  You can read where a forward pass is coming from (against an opponent), or you can find gaps in defenses for your own passes.  And this isn't because you've got talent.  It's because you can read a defense/your own team.  Milner has this in spades.  It's the reason people like Joe Allen, too.  Yes, Can makes death-defying lunges and amazing looking last minute clearances.  But, if he was in a better position in the first place, he would not have had to.


Emre Can is a talented footballer, but our team needs James Milner there instead.  And for me, I've liked seeing Can come on as a sub to provide more steely grit and a surprising amount of pace against the more tired legs of the opposition.

Agreed, but what he did have was a less aggressive version of what Corbyn is pushing.

&gt;I doubt think the country would reject him on trident nor would they reject him on his anti austerity stance. Who gives a shit about his view on America?

He will be attacked so harshly for it, by almost everybody except Greenpeace, it is not a sensible move, nor is it one that people will agree with once the facts are set out. As for austerity, like other have said before the UK is sold on it, you can't stand against it as the majority of people support it. Miliband tried to do austerity lite and still got hammered for economic incompetence, think what Corbyn will look like. The Tories would have to have some very big slip ups for people to start questioning it. Who cares about America? Business and foreign policy a negative campaign against the USA will not work to his advantage as it has for other leaders on the continent, the UK electorate is closer to the USA.  

&gt;If Corbyn can provide a stable message of hope whilst beating Cameron on his record, he's got a great chance.

That's going to be very difficult because A Labour will be in ruins and B the Cameron ministry is still riding high on economic growth and perhaps will be for at least another 12 months. The migrant problem is a big one, but I don't see how Corbyn the Champion of social justice can maneuver correctly to attack the problem head on any better than the Tories, in fact I can only see his background and stance constraining him.

No it's not. The total number their communities increase by does, aka the net increase. People don't give a shit if 100,000 migrants arrive (the gross figure) if 100,000 leave at the same time. Gross figures only take into account the arrivals or departures as two separate quantities.

They are not included in the net number of EU citizens coming to the UK. No matter how much you say they are the number which is quoted in the article does not include them.

&gt;I ask why are we so bothered about immigration, we benefit from it greatly otherwise the NHS wouldn't work and neither would many other public services

No one wants to exclude NHS workers but the point stands that not all immigration is beneficial. Because of our membership of the EU we have to take the wheat with the chaff.

&gt;the fact is immigration isn't taking your jobs

Nope. This is skewed by looking at 'net benefit' which is absurd. Taking in a Russian billionaire does not make it OK to take in 1000 unemployable people because there is still a 'net benefit'.

null,null,Locke66,null,null,null,"Go into any major supermarket.  They now have 50% of their customers using banks of automated tills with 1 person supervising rather than multiple staffed tills with 1 person supervising.  Any company that involves entertainment or hospitality such as cinemas and theaters are rapidly looking at changing to automated booking systems completely removing the need for staff in those areas.  There are lots of examples where telephone services are changing human staff for automated systems (paying your road tax for example) and even more where advanced computing is removing the need for a person to do many of their current tasks.  That's just a few examples and it's the thin end of the wedge.

Other examples:

[Amazon are in the process of automating their warehouses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWFjS3Ci7A) and looking at using drones [for their delivery system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le46ERPMlWU).  There are currently serious discussions going on about how drones can be used safely for this process and proposals to give them a designated cruising altitude.  How many people are involved in warehousing and delivery services that can be removed from the process? 

[The Mining industry is going heavily automated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY6ZyASJbzs).  This is already pretty much a done deal in advanced economies and will likely increase.  The same technology may eventually be applied to things like road repairs etc.

[Google among others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCezICQNgJU) are pushing forward quickly with the automated car.  So far it works better than humans in a world not created for it.  Can you imagine what happens to any industry that involves a driver (taxis, goods haulage, small scale delivery etc) when that technology is perfected?  Look at something as simple as Uber and all the problems it is causing with traditional taxi companies and they are already saying they want automated cars in place of their current drivers.

[Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjOutf395s) is removing more and more people from the production line when it comes to building their cars with a goal of going completely automated.

So right there as a simplified supply chain you potentially have an automated mine that can deliver resources to an automated factory in automated trucks that can send those goods to an automated warehouse who can then send those goods out by automated delivery all with minimal human input.

These are just the things that are pretty much here right now and can potentially be rolled out in the next 10-20 years.  The technology is advancing extremely fast and there are a lot of huge backers who have looked at this stuff and read the writing on the wall (including the military). When you consider things like the major advances being made in voice recognition, robot AI, virtual reality and motion detection sensors the future looks pretty interesting.

In all honestly, they were lucky to get a win against Spurs and lacklustre in the games against Villa and Newcastle. The only time they've been somewhat impressive was in the Champions League but Brugge allowed them to play that way and perhaps the gulf in opposition is what made them look good.

While we have both had a game this week, our squad was entirely made of the 2nd XI while theirs was mostly first team players. Hopefully that hangover would work in our favour.

If Montero can get down the line often, we have a great arial presence with Gomis and Ayew against the likes of Blind and Shaw. That would be my key match up to press as often as possible.

I don't think we need to go the defensive route, but should easily take this game to them like we did against Chelsea. Garry may disagree though, with the ambition of keeping the unbeaten run going.

No reason we can't win this. 2 - 0 Swansea, but MOTD will still focus on United and we'll get a ""I like Swansea, they play nice football"" at the end of the segment.

&gt;It is not a message that you will hear from many, if any, mainstream politicians but, as the government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has pointed out, mass migration has been a key factor fuelling Britain’s economic recovery.

&gt;Nope. This is skewed by looking at 'net benefit' which is absurd. Taking in a Russian billionaire does not make it OK to take in 1000 unemployable people because there is still a 'net benefit'. Why are we taking non beneficial migrants at all? Why not only take the decent ones?

Actually it all makes senses on FSGs part and you make zero sense. We still need to get rid of Balotelli in a year and you don't think AC Milan or 1 whole year of good or bad performances will be a factor in the selling price rather than 1 article about his character. AC Milan, Inter Milan, City everyone know how bad his attitude his. He fought with Mancini for fucks sake but LFC fans were adamant that he deserved a chance and BR was so stubborn and not letting him play just because he was a committee buy. This along with new Sakho deal sheds light on how it is all about performances and Balotelli was never to be trusted. He's a lost cause so the only way we're actually getting money for him next year is if he performs well and not because of this article. The main thing this article addresses is the club and it's fans and the trust on the manager which is all we need to care about.

As others have said, though, that will only have an impact if actual Oxford students start adding real content as well.

chance that someone will die in a 6 week period is going to be 6/52nds of the chance of death in a year

let's grab numbers from [here](http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/dyingage.html) and say 1/800 for an average annual death rate for an average worker

so 6/52 * 1/800 for 6/41600

let's call that 1/7000

the 2380 deaths figure is taken over a sample of 25 months
so for this number to be in line with the general population we'd have to see them returning 1.4 million people to work

However, and it's a massive however, this isn't the general population we're talking about. This is people in receipt of disability benefit. More likely to be old, ill and possibly more likely to be male, all which could drastically reduce that number. 

e.g. if the annual death rate for former recipients of disability benefit was in the region of 4x the average person's, we'd only need to see 350k people returned to work for it to be in line with expectations.

You are not taxed on debt interest that hasn't been paid, where-as if you saved the money in a taxable bank account you would be taxed on the interest earned.

That depends. Are they part-exchanging their old guns with a legit dealer when they get the new model? I'll grant that there is a certain amount of uncertainty in as much as you can sell a gun to someone for cash in the US, and the lack of a licensing system means they might not be legit, and I absolutely agree that there does seem to be room for guns to move from the white market to the black market.

That being said, a lot of it seems to be with fairly black-market guns, or the authorities actively turning a blind eye - the [ATF allowed a load of guns to be sold to drug runners as part of a sting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal) - except they lost track of the guns, which then started turning up at crime scenes on both sides of the US-Mexico border, including an incident where a border agent was shot dead - with a gun that the ATF ""allowed to walk"".

The ""War on Drugs"" has been a disaster and the ATF in and of themselves have managed to cause some of the violence.

Moreover, the USA has two huge land borders north and south. If you cut off the domestic supply of guns from the white market, it would be entirely possible for organised gangs to both manufacture guns in-country (ownership of lathes isn't licensed - yet!), or smuggle them across the border - exactly as happens in the UK where we have no white market for handguns.

So yes, you can address guns walking between markets, but it's pointless preventing the black-market sourcing from the white-market if you don't deal with the other end of the problem (completely black-market supply).",null,0,null,1440685994,null,null,false,0,cuhh2i8,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cuhgq1c,null,null,null,1441528817,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Automated warehousing is one of the places where smart automation has already been around for some time. Buried wire guided vehicles have been used for ages in factories. The Amazon stuff is fairly cool, but it's not much different to the already existing auto archive retrieval already in use in libraries.  I doubt their drone for delivery system is going to replace loads of courier jobs. Are courier jobs low paid jobs? Are they the sort of jobs that migrants take?

Watch an Amazon warehouse in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quWFjS3Ci7A  You can see it's semi-automated but they still require people to take stuff out of buckets and manually scan barcodes. The video also shows a couple robot arms, but that's it.    I bet they require a lot of people to put the merchandise in to those nice boxes so the robots can retrieve them.

[""A ""startup kit"" of robots, for a small warehouse operation, costs is in the order of $1 million to $2 million.""](http://www.mwpvl.com/html/kiva_systems.html) - no small investment for lots of small warehouses.

Mining industry jobs aren't low paid jobs and most of those devices are remote controlled, or are operated within very tightly controlled environments.  I think we're far off from complete automation of those vehicles as a mine is a very complex environment which still requires a person in the seat.

Under the current system, the group are net contributors to the tune of £16k per person per year. Hurrah, they must be a good thing.

Under the proposed system, the professionals would be in for sure, with plenty enough points to secure a visa. The office worker might struggle, it depends on how tough the points system is, but lets say he makes it. The unskilled workers don't get enough points, so their visa applications are turned down.

Result: the net contribution is now £40k per person per year.

To me this perfectly illustrates why I personally find Corbyn so difficult to get behind. This is a clear issue where he and New Labour differ. Corbyn thinks public money being paid to private companies is a bad thing.  I am ambivalent - to me what matters is that it offers value for money and maintains/increases the level of care.

PFI schemes built lots of new hospitals without having to pay all the money now. If they have since turned out to be bad value for money by all means buy out of contracts. If not, don't. It should be that simple.

Corbyn seems to be suggesting buying all hospitals out of PFI contracts regardless. This is a classic case of putting one's own ideology ahead of what's best for the public.

It's a relatively small issue, but you see a similar stance over things like fracking, GM crops, academies, nationalisation.

No. Not in any way whatsoever.

Unless you believe that no one should die of anything within two years of being found ""fit to work"", it's meaningless on its own.

null,null,jleavesl,null,null,null,"I'm an American gun owner who lives in Texas but has lived all over the country at different times (Minnesota, New York, Louisiana, Pascagoula Mississippi) and there are some pretty massive differences culturally between the different regions in this country.  Not only in politics but also in our food, dialect, and our cultural norms (southern hospitality is a very real thing).  

This isn't a hard thing to believe when you realize that my state alone has 2.5x the landmass as the UK.  We also don't really have the same homogeneous culture that it seems the UK has.  We're a relatively young country and each section was settled by different groups of people from different nationalities (and that culture has morphed) and we're very spread out.  When you say a hillbilly (which is a derogatory term btw) and someone in downtown LA are more similar than different, I don't think you are taking into account the 2000 miles that lies between them.  They may have the same shows on cable and speak the same language, but their way of life is likely dramatically different.  One of the most stark differences I've found is when you get in the truck and drive the 350 miles from Houston to New Orleans.  The food, the music, the culture, even their legal systems are extremely different (Louisiana still clings to Napoleonic law where as Texas doesn't).  You start to notice some pretty stark differences when you travel.  

As to the gun thing, which I doubt either of us will be able to convince the other that their point of view is wrong, it's something that your culture and mine view in a very different light.  You have to realize there are about as many guns as there are people in this country and for a lot of us (especially in the South) we don't view them in the same light as you or New Yorkers do.  Right now, the plant I'm working at is on the Texas/Louisiana border and I can assure you that if you were to go out to the parking lot and search every truck, you'd find at least 50 firearms (probably far more during hunting season).  Nobody really pays it much mind nor has there really been much reason to start.  I don't think there has been a murder here in decades.  

I have house in Houston and most of my family lives there.  My brother and my wife have both used a firearm to deter someone from breaking into their home.  Fortunately, neither one had to discharge their weapon (brandishing it deterred the intruder in both cases).  As such, I'd be hesitant to give up my Beretta or take the shotgun I got when I was 10 away from my wife (it's the perfect size for her).  

My folks bought 28 acres in central Texas a few years ago.  We built a deer stand in the backyard and have both a rifle and a skeet range there as well.  We (and all of their neighbors) will get bored of watching television, working on the tractor, or whatever and go in the backyard to shoot.  It's not uncommon to be sitting outside eating and hear gunfire up the road.  It really isn't a big deal as nobody gets hurt out there aside from deer and feral pigs and if in the unlikely event my parents to defend themselves against an intruder, it would take the state trooper about an hour to get out there (and that is if their cellphone worked well enough for them to get a call out and the State Trooper didn't get lost on his way out there).  I don't see my parents or their neighbors handing in their weapons either.  Come to think of it, I think I know about 8 people who don't own a firearm and most of those that do wouldn't comply with an order to turn them in.

It's important to get a desiccant model, because they work in the cold (normal compressor-type ones work fine in hot places, but don't work well in the UK). The one I linked is the one I bought after a good deal of research, because although it's a little pricey, it has good ratings, is from a UK company (if that's important to you), and most importantly will work with a timeswitch so you can run it on economy seven.

It completely cured our damp, also provides a little bit of warmth.

In any case, those kinds of questions aren't really engaging and are really specific to the OP.  Questions like 'What is it like to go to a college ball?' would be a great forum for discussion on eg the pros and cons of commemoration balls vs non commemoration balls, a discussion of Oxford elitism, reminiscing about the best balls in the last academic year, etc.

He could have taken that further, though, by asking the Newsnight presenter whether *he* had seen the videos. And then BBC production staff-- had they seen it? Then the question becomes: Why should a BBC producer be ""allowed"" to see something that the rest of us can't?

There are two questions here: What the public should be able to access if they choose to go out and access it, and what's appropriate for printing in a national newspaper.

City have more youngsters in the pipeline, another will come in and show value - Barker, Garcia, Pozo, etc.

Yeah, the plan was to move the remainder to the Santander 123.  We wanted to both do the full switch to get access to 2x6% regular savers at First Direct and get 2x100GBP for the full switch.

Then we planned to take advantage of either the Halifax/TSB 5% current accounts up to 2000/25000.

The rest either would go into a Santander 123 that we would maybe jointly open.  Not sure if there is any benefit in joint opening?

null,null,Locke66,null,null,null,"Regarding the tills yeah fair enough maybe they aren't technically ""robots"" but the same effect applies of new technology removing low skilled jobs.

While the technology for automated warehousing may not be new as such it's certainly improving to the point where it's becoming much more viable for large scale implementation.  As soon as the tipping point is reached where it's economically sound it will be rolled out very fast.  A few million sounds a lot until your paying even more for the staff.  That in itself squeezes the wage value of human labour because if these companies are paying a decent wage for these jobs then it becomes more efficient to change over sooner.  In general I would say we are also slowly moving towards more large companies in the UK that can afford this sort of startup cost rather than small suppliers who can't. Yes there are still people involved in the process atm but there are far less of them and there will be continual pressure to find ways to remove them (there is a lot of research going into how to make a robot pick items from shelves etc).  

Drone delivery seems pretty wild I agree and it's likely to be niche at first if at all successful but the cost and efficiency savings are unbelievable so who knows.  

The automation of mines is already pretty much also ready to go.  I can't find a good source on youtube right now but I watched a BBC documentary the other day exploring this and an entire iron ore mining site was effectively being run by 20 people in a control booth while unmanned vehicles did everything else.  They just needed a few guys on the ground for general maintenance.  Yes it won't work in every mining or similar industry sector but it will fit a lot of them if only in part.

Self driving cars are probably the ""most ready"" to go into production and I would not at all be surprised to see world wide production within 5 years.  While yes it will take years to produce them in sufficient quantities for them to become dominant again the cost savings are potentially enormous and that will drive the demand. 

Really the point is not about migrants but about the jobs market in total.  We are looking at there being the potential for continual erosion of a lot of what are considered stable job sectors where humans will become ""obsolete"" and there is nothing clear for them to do instead.

You keep one of them, give him the double load, and fire the other who will now have no income instead of a merely reduced income. Likewise, you'll find that even if your money goes further because goods are cheaper, your employer will rarely let you and your colleague both cut back to three day weeks. Instead, your employer will just get one of you to work double and fire the spare.

If you had a minimum wage job, lost it to automation, joined the thousand people competing for the few remaining minimum wage jobs in your area, and failed to be among the lucky few of those thousand, then you won't have enough money left to go on holiday and spur the British tourism economy. You might not have enough left to pay your Sky bill, or even your Netflix bill, and going to the cinema is very expensive these days.

Free time activities that would spur the economy require those participating in the activities to have spendable money in the first place. Even free museums need both private &amp; public funding and gift-shop spending to stay afloat.

We moved from hunting &amp; gathering to farming and building. We moved from farming &amp; building to hand-making fancier things. We automated the hand making and moved toward modern industry. We automated *that* and moved into services. Where are we going to move next? Who will pay for the new jobs needed? We already need more staffing for the care sector, which should be our logical next leap, but it's staggeringly underfunded, under-trained, and under-staffed.

(in an ideal world, like that of 1950s Popular Mechanics magazines, we *would* be able to cut back to two and three day weeks, allowing full employment while we all enjoyed the fruits of automation making our lives easier.

** Merseyside Derby (Everton v. Liverpool) **
Everton was also the original football team in Liverpool. Everton first played in Anfield before a political spat with the owner John Houlding who later founded Liverpool F.C. This match is known as the friendly derby considering the relatively close proximity of the stadiums and thus the number of friends and family members that are both Everton and Liverpool supporters. 

- We dominated the 1980s domestically and internationally

- There is some question as to why Everton went into hard times after the 1980s. Most of it is because of the ban on English Clubs from European competition after the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Some Liverpool ultras chased Juve fans towards a collapsing wall which created a crush. UEFA and Thatcher put restrictions on English Football to combat hooliganism.

Therefore all refugees looking for asylum in the EU are economic migrants by that definition. You may not agree with that logic, I certainly don't, but there you have it. 

They're incorrect if your definition of a refugee is the one the UNHCR (and government) uses *""Any person who: owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"".* By this definition it doesn't matter how many safe countries someone has travelled through, they're still a refugee, and still permitted protection by the UK under law.

No, actually. I didn't say that at all. I didn't even imply it. The only time I ever see that argument deployed is as it has just been here; a strawman argument set-up to attack.

Fear of life is almost certainly one of the biggest migratory pressures into Europe. You only need to look at the make-up of countries that people are claiming asylum from to see that the majority are war-torn. But once in Europe there are many different factors that may be at play that make people end up at Calais looking to come into the UK, such as family or friendship connections, being able to speak the language, the rejecting of asylum applications in other countries, people smuggling, and economic factors.

I'm not arguing that there won't be a number there who are there because they've heard good things about the UK and are trying to make it here rather than stop somewhere else. I'm just saying it is idiotic to think that every single person there is there simply because they think they can get better benefits or a free house in the UK.

Instead, your employer will just get one of you to work double and fire the spare.

The guy who ends up keeping the job will effectively earn more (as supermarkets are cheaper), so whereas he used to spend £50 on food he now spends £30 and he can use those £20 to go to the cinema creating jobs at Odeon.

&gt;If you had a minimum wage job, lost it to automation, joined the thousand people competing for the few remaining minimum wage jobs in your area, and failed to be among the lucky few of those thousand, then you won't have enough money left to go on holiday and spur the British tourism economy. You might not have enough left to pay your Sky bill, or even your Netflix bill, and going to the cinema is very expensive these days.

This is circular logic:

1. There won't be jobs to replace those lost to automation.

2. The people who have lost their jobs won't have an income to demand things that create jobs.

3. Therefore there won't be any jobs to replace those lost to automation.

With SEPA you pay a 3% fee (charged by your bank on receipt of EUR funds) 
With SWIFT you pay £30 (charged by coinbase for sending a GBP SWIFT).

* We won the FA Cup in 1995, but we haven't won a significant piece of silverware since. Though I'm hopeful we can bag the League Cup again for the first time since, well, ever. It's unlikely, but I have hope.

* Everton was at its peak in the 1980s and 1990s before Kenwright took over. Everything has gone practically downhill since then, but we did briefly have Rooney playing for us until 2005.

* We were the original team in Liverpool, and we played in Anfield until there was a row over the stadium's rent. Then Liverpool FC (The Kopites) was made and they moved into Anfield, Everton moved into Goodison, and the two rivals have been there since, separated only by a stretch of park.

* Dixie Dean, Gary Lineker and Duncan Ferguson are some notable Everton stars.

* The Gwladys Street Stand in Goodison is where most of the home support is.

* Roberto Martinez is our manager but I'm sure you know that already. He isn't the one that we need to blame - the board and Kenwright are the enemies here. Roberto isn't actually a bad manager.

* Lukaku is a tank - you can't argue that he's one of the PL's best strikers, and once he gets the ball and starts running, the defenders will be on the floor. Seriously, the man is a beast and he's only 22.

* We have alot of debt to pay off.

* We need a new stadium in Walton Hall Park.

* There's a big bit of drama surrounding our star defender John Stones - 3 bids of £20m, £26m and £30m from Chelsea were all rejected by Everton, and Roberto has consistently said he is not for sale. Shit hit the fan, however, when Stones submitted a transfer request and had it rejected, so he's being kept at Everton. Some numptys abused the lad after the Barnsley match, and those fans I say are a real big pack of dicks.

* Arouna Kone, formerly a crap player who everyone wanted to be sold, has turned into a bit of a maestro after the stunning equaliser he made against Watford which made him regain his confidence and made him a better player overall.

* Gerard Deulofeu is magic.

* We really, really, really want Andriy Yarmolenko.

* At the Chelsea match on 12 September, we will chant this:

""You can't have John Stones,""
""You can't have John Stoooooones!""
""Fuck off Jose,""
""You can't have our Stones!""

* Our last game was against Barnsley, where we won 5-3. The first half was absolutely dreadful, and we were 2-0 down by the end. But then Ross ""The Diamond"" Barkley and Gerard ""Magic Man"" Deulofeu came on the pitch. Soon after, Kevin Mirallas fired a stunning scissor kick into the back of the net, Naismith scored the equaliser with a flukey header, but Barnsley were put back in the lead with a shot from Crowley. After that the real fun began and Lukaku almost scored a hat-trick, which he was denied by Marc Roberts' own goal.

- Stomping out abuses like underpaid workers whose jobs weren't advertised in the UK, unsafe housing situations, etc.
- Reframing the narrative: what immigrants do and contribute to the economy, that they aren't all lying benefit thieves, etc. etc. 

And packaging it all in a nice platform of social justice and income redistribution. Fear of immigration is largely based on economic insecurity, which is why UKIP do terribly in London even though they've got loads of migrants and why it does really well in the North and in depressed areas, even if some of those areas have very few migrants. I think that's why Corbyn does pretty well among UKIP voters - they're fearful of the future, especially economically, and they're anti-politics, and his views are very much focused on economic security for people in the bottom third of the income pile and he don't give a hoot.

I presented numerous studies, as well as my own arguments which were rooted in how people actually voted in 2015, all of which either confirm Cruddas' findings, complement them in ways I explained, or both.

Thus, the weakness of that question in Cruddas' piece is a valid criticism of Cruddas, but not of me. Nor does it invalidate the rest of Cruddas' findings. It invalidates that one finding...

&gt;they really need to release stats on who died from what, and what their disability claim was for.

I doubt they have data on who died from what. But they should definitely start investigating. There should be a department which monitors these precise things.

null,null,thatsdelightful,null,null,null,"I'm 29, a friend was in exactly the same boat as you (literally, he got fired, gf left him, went bankrupt, started drinking heavily and put on weight, no real qualifications). He had to move back in with his mum. The biggest problem of his actually was lack of routine, he was just caught up in this shit spiral. So this is what he did 

- Stopped drinking. Drinking was the fuel to his shit fire, it was making him more depressed and generally amplifying his negative mood, also made him pile the weight on.

- Routine. He started a routine, woke up at the same time everyday, made his bed, showered, dressed ,ate breakfast, went for a walk (initially for like 20 minutes and then worked up to a couple of hours). He started loosing weight and feeling better.

- Volunteering. He started volunteering at his local food bank. Helping make up the food parcels, making cups of tea and talking to the people showing up. His situation was bad, but this kicked him up the arse, least he had a roof over his head and food. He was giving food parcels to single mothers with kids to feed. It made him realise that whilst there was no denying his situation was dire it wasn't as bad as other people. 

- Got a little bar job. He'd never worked in a bar or pub but managed to wangle himself a job. This was a month or so after he started turning himself around, I guess by this point he was just more employable simply because he was more upbeat and confident.

So he's now living, doing productive stuff, helping people. However, he still found living in the same area hard, too many bad memories. He then got in touch with some agencies who do live in care work, they provided some free training for him (a week or two IIRC) and now he's a live in carer for a bloke somewhere down near Wiltshire. He's earning pretty good money, exercises (he must of lost 2 stone). 

I think my main point is that he turned himself around by adopting a routine. I think he would still be where he is now if not worst off if he hadn't.

I dealt with the criticism about the other candidates in the article which you claim to have read. In brief: The article makes the case that Corbyn will not be able to get the Party elected. It acknowledges that the other candidates may also not be able to get the Party elected. It argues that any of the other candidates probably stand a slightly better chance, and gives several reasons for this. It also argues that, even if a 2020 'win' (i.e., a parliamentary majority in Westminster) is off the cards, that does not mean that electing someone who very clearly can't win is somehow OK.

If we count migrants as people who are allowed to permanently settle in the UK, which I think is what the general public is more concerned about, the actual figure would be much lower than 300,000 people per year.

Boyle is right to point out that Britain has been hypocritical in its support for Saudi Arabia, but what does that have to do with Corbyn's meetings with various deeply unsavoury people and groups? He reached out to these people as an obscure backbencher, a rather different matter than, say, a minister meeting their counterpart from some nasty regime. Even if we accept these two as equivalent then at best he is no different. 

It isn't at all clear what Boyle is trying to say here. He asks if we're only opposed to beheadings when they're not for sorcery, which is cute, but what is he getting at? It seems that he thinks our support of Saudi Arabia means that Corbyn's fascist-praising Tourette's shouldn't be an issue. Why he thinks that I could not say, he'd already moved on to a lame non sequitur about Mugabe. He doesn't seem to be able to think past the moment: he rightly condemns our present arrangement with Saudi, but there's no acknowledgement that Corbyn would seek compromise with ISIS. The ethical compromises we make compromise us, ergo make more?

In a society under Islamic law, such would be severely punished… If people have such desires [homosexuality], they should keep them to themselves, and control their desires to avoid forbidden practices. The advice would be the same as, say, to someone who had sexual desires for minors or for close family: that having the desires does not legitimize realizing them.” Uhh, tell that to all the Muslims around the world who marry children because they’re following the tradition of the prophet, pigs be upon him. Not to mention the incestuous arranged marriages… yuck. What Does Islam Say? also advocates the penalty of lashing for fornication and sodomy as being part of “True Islam.”

null,null,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; Most stations have no staff the majority of the time and run much longer hours.

The stations yes (as is the case on the London Underground as well...), not the trains... And looking it up, the BMT Canarsie Lines and IRT Flushing Line are the only automated lines in the New York Subway, and even then they are only Grade 2 automation (which is the same level as the Northern, Jubilee, Victoria and Central lines), meaning that door controls are still manually operated (as these systems aren't sophisticated enough to be able to reliably detect whether it's safe to close the doors).

And it's not fear mongering, terrorist attacks are on a more heavy end of the list of emergency situations (things on the lighter end are circuit malfunctions, jumpers and incidents on the train). 

Whilst there do exist systems that don't require any supervision, these are all on subsurface-level and light railway trains rather than deep-level systems. If something bad happens on a subsurface-level train, then it is relatively easy for trained professionals to get to it quite quickly. With deep-level systems, the trains are much harder to get to, and you are putting the lives of passengers at risk if you send them into a narrow tunnel a mile below the surface without supervision...

I was also reading the report the new tube for London by TfL and they were talking about some unique challenges with the automation of the underground:

* To remove the need to manually open and close doors, you need to ensure that passengers can't try to hop on the train at very last minute. This requires the installation of station barriers. Currently, these barriers are only deployed on a few stations on the Jubilee line. To ensure passenger safety, they would need to be deployed across every station on the network..

* Reliable automation without the need of a manual override requires the trains to have reliable communication with central control. However, many of the tunnels are built in such a way that they completely block all radio signals (the Bakerloo line, for example, is a complete mess apparently).",null,0,null,1440697019,null,null,false,0,cuhog2g,null,t3_3ikvsl,null,null,null,t1_cuhmv4d,null,null,null,1441532359,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

&gt; To get geeky/finicky about the Data Protection Act, CLP canvassers should generally not be recording data about individual voters who are not supporters; i.e. expressed a view that they support another party!

&gt; This is because most (I think) CLPs, who generally operate the canvassers, when they registered under the DPA stated that they would only collect data about:

&gt; We process personal information about: 
* our members
* supporters
* complainants and enquirers
* employees

&gt; So they have not registered under the DPA to collect data about voters who expressed opposition! So generally CLPs should not, strictly, be in the possession of canvassing data indicating which local voters opposed Labour! This is probably an oversight, but that is what CLPs have generally registered to do. So it seems there should strictly be no canvassing records of views that might disenfranchise registered supporters!!

&gt; You can look up your own CLP's registration atthis link if you are interested. A query such as Name: ""exeter labour"" will usually get you to the CLP entry.

For the record, I have no children and probably work a damn sight harder than you will ever do. Up at 6am, working from 8, have about an hour or two with the OH, bed around 11-12. Same the day after.

But I'm lazy and workshy right?

&gt; Scrap LHA bring back poor houses, yet again more state sponsoring that rewards laziness and punishes the working man by forcing him to compete with the work shy on rent costs.

Read above point.

&gt; Having kids should not be a free meal ticket, if you can't feed your own kids the government should remove them from you and place them in state run care which will be concentrated and intesive and thus cheap instead of sponsoring careless breeding programs.

Who the fuck gives you the right to dictate who can and can't have kids?

We have a recent history of selling/trading players who are underperforming only to see them really hit a stride with their next club, so I guess I wouldn't be super surprised to see Maloney step up his game, but I have to say, many of us were pretty shocked at how ineffective he was.

I know there are some people who think MLS has reached a similar level to the Championship, but I don't hold that opinion at all, and in terms of MLS we were (and still are) dead last in the league.

So, from our standpoint, we couldn't understand why a guy with his pedegree looked sooooo average, on the worst team in the league.  On top of that, he was getting out-played by teammates making $1200/week and by rookies who were playing in their first professional games in their lives.  Somethings messed up about that as he was making $1.5MM/year and looked like an average journeyman player out there who typically make like $80k/year.

Anyway, he seemed like a good guy, didn't have any bad stuff to say about anyone, but looked a shadow of the player I had watched in england during previous years.  I hope with a group of better players around him he's able to elevate his game and help you guys out.

There is the CIA (Celestial Intervention Agency) that messes around with time but most Time Lords are strict noninterventionalists - it's part of why the Doctor ran away, he was bored of sitting outside history and observing it. But for the most part Time Lords aren't a military race, they just had to protect themselves from the Daleks during the Time War and such.

TARDISes aren't military vehicles by default, but they can be modified into such, in one of the audios some of them had temporal torpedoes. For the most part they're just used to observe I think.

I haven't really seen most of Classic, this is just info I picked up from the new series and the Big Finish audios I've listened to so far.

They have attacked some civilizations in the past though. Vampires most notably. They might have committed a genocide or two when they blew up a star to turn it into the Eye Of Harmony which allows them to travel through time.

null,null,okem,null,null,null,"Just for clarity. The DWP don't diagnose they just assess capability for work. Sounds like semantics I know, but it is kind of important. A claimant will usually have a diagnosed condition, impairment or illness, a letter from a GP, Mental Health practitioner etc confirming such. The DWP will then assess the claimant's capability for work. This is done with a series of questions that are then marked out of 10 and claimants must score over a certain level to receive state benefits. These question are generally biased towards those with physical impairments that inhibit or stop people from being able to work. If you're claiming because of mental health reasons it's obviously harder to assess, although the Tory's have recently made it easier by declaring most mental health issue not a reason to not be in full time employment.

So, a claimant can have a diagnosed, severely debilitating condition and still be declared 'fit for work'. Some will fail to score enough points and just have their benefits removed or denied and be forced onto jobseekers. But more often how the system is working these days is that the DWP will recognise that a claimant is unfit for work, award them benefits, but following that with a 'but we think you could be doing something so we are placing you on a mandatory work program'. These are privately run programs whose employees get a bonus for every claimant they get into employment. The sole goal of these programs is to get people off benefits and into fulltime employment. So there are now thousands of people in these programs that have been medically signed off work by a Healthcare professional and subsequently deemed unfit for work by the DWP, trapped in a catch 22 system that is trying to force those who can not work, into work. Anyone in that system who fails to engage for whatever reason will expect to have their benefits sanction or stopped. Miss an appointment from anything from a mental health reason to an MRI and you can be sanctioned.

Mr X is a single person with no dependents/housing costs working 4 hours a week at 6.50 an hour. That's about £105 a month. Since the UC work allowance is £111, his monthly benefit of £317.82 is unaffected and he receives it in full. 

His monthly income is £105 + 317.82 = £422.82

Mr Z is a single person with no dependents/housing costs working 8 hours a week at 6.50 an hour. That's about £210 a month. For him the calculation for earnings is as follows. His monthly earnings of £210 - £111 = £99. 65% of that £99 is then taken off his benefit. Therefore £99*.65 is £64.35, and that's what is deducted from his monthly UC of £317.82.

So his monthly income would be £210 + £253.47 = £463.47.

They're at a point where they are going out of there way to invite immigrants (to the point of absurdity) when they have no homes and nowhere for all these migrants to go so they line the streets, camp out in libraries and generally make it more shite for everyone.

It's like 'Tumblr: the country' and they are starting to reap what they sow with native Swedes and other immigrants leaving areas en-masse due to the abusive Islamists that are moving in and bringing with them a culture where being gay, trans or even Jewish puts you in harms way (not to mention a nice increase in rape and crime stats) and even police are refusing to police these areas.

When all the EDL nutters bang on about the Muslims pretty much invading the UK then you have to laugh, Sweden is the perfect example of what happens when immigration reaches an unsustainable level because they're all too scared to appear racist by telling them no.

Other legislation can be imposed to restrict the harm of vehicles. Speed limits. Drink driving legislation. All Seek to reduce the harm vehicles do. Indeed the UK has some of the safest roads in the world despite very crowded roads, high vehicle ownership AND an affluent population that can afford high performance cars.

the PLP:

A. If the sitting MP wishes to stand for re-election,
a trigger ballot will be carried out through party
units and affiliates according to NEC guidelines.
If the MP wins the trigger ballot he/ she will,
subject to NEC endorsement, be selected as the
CLP’s prospective parliamentary candidate.

B. If the MP fails to win the trigger ballot, he/ she
shall be eligible for nomination for selection as
the prospective parliamentary candidate, and
s/he shall be included in the shortlist of
candidates from whom the selection shall be
made.

C. If the said MP is not selected as the prospective
parliamentary candidate s/he shall have the right
of appeal to the NEC. The appeal can only be
made on the grounds that the procedures laid
down in the rules and the general provisions of
the constitution, rules and standing orders have
not been properly carried out. The appeal must
be received by the NEC by the date on which
they consider endorsement of the parliamentary
candidate for the constituency.

D. When there is a formal announcement of a royal
proclamation to dissolve Parliament before the
trigger ballot or the constituency selection
meeting(s) have been held, the provisions of this
clause (other than this paragraph) shall be
suspended and the said MP shall be reselected
as the prospective parliamentary candidate,
subject to NEC endorsement.

E. If the MP has intimated her or his intention to
retire, the provisions of this clause shall not
apply.

6. In all circumstances (i.e. where there is no MP, where
the MP has announced s/he is retiring or where the
MP is putting themselves forward for re-selection
but has failed to win the trigger ballot) the CLP
Shortlisting Committee shall draw up a shortlist of
interested candidates to present to all members of
the CLP who are eligible to vote in accordance with
Clause I.1.A above.

7. The selection of candidates shall consist of a vote,
by eliminating ballot, of all eligible individual
members of the constituency on the basis of one
member one vote.

8. NEC Endorsement

A. The selection of a parliamentary candidate shall
not be regarded as completed until the name of
the member selected has been placed before a
meeting of the NEC and her or his selection has
been endorsed. Until such endorsement has been
received the member shall not be introduced to
the public as a prospective candidate. Where
successful candidates are not members of the
national recommended panel or if in the case of a
sitting MP a referral from the Whips office is
received, there should, however, be an
endorsement interview in each case before a
recommendation is made to the NEC

B. If the NEC is satisfied that there is prima facie
evidence of a breach of rules by an individual,
the NEC shall have the right after such
investigations and interviews with the individual
as the NEC shall consider reasonably practicable
and appropriate to decline to endorse or, where
already endorsed, rescind endorsement of such
individual as a prospective parliamentary
candidate.

9. A CLP, having completed the selection of its
prospective parliamentary candidate according to
these rules, shall accept responsibility for the
election expenses of the candidate so selected.
Acceptance of such financial responsibility shall
become binding on the CLP concerned upon NEC
endorsement of the candidature.",null,0,null,1440700852,null,null,false,0,cuhr2ef,null,t3_3imj59,null,null,null,t3_3imj59,null,null,null,1441533594,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Could you point me at those numbers please - the before especially? I'm seeing the after figure reported, but there's no normalisation or other statistical analysis. This number on its own is irrelevant - people die all the time. 

For example, 1700-1900 people die on Britain's roads each year. If the UK population was 100k, then that would be a high rate. As it's more like 70 million, it's maybe not too bad. 

Likewise, we know that 2380 died over just over 2 years. How many were hit by cars? How many had heart attacks? How many were judged as fit for work and didn't die - is that 2380 out of 10k, or 2380 out of 100k. Was their death rate higher or lower than the general population when normalised for their social status, overall health, etc - obese heavy drinkers are more likely to die but can still work (not suggesting that all, or even any, were obese heavy drinkers).

null,null,b4sunryze,crest-new,,null,"**tl;dr** Tons of Young Talent

One of the most compelling aspects of being an Everton fan is following the development of our young players. We have a core of young players just about to hit their prime. 

We will sink or swim based on their development and our ability to keep them as they grow into hopefully EPL and Champions League level-caliber players.

For fans who are patient enough, following a football club like Everton and a manager like Roberto Martinez could be immensely satisfying. Fans of Everton and manager Roberto Martinez are keenly aware of the challenges in putting together a competitive and winning team - mostly due to our lack of financial resources. 

We have neither a rich ""Sugar-daddy"" owner nor a new stadium. As a result, we cannot afford to buy expensive players from other teams and bring them in as quick-fixes that richer teams like Man United, Man City, Chelsea, Arseanal, Tottenham regularly do every off-season. For those teams, if a player isn't performing they can just sell them off and buy a better replacement.

Instead, what Everton has to do is take a chance on essentially what are ""lottery tickets"": cheaper, younger players like John Stones (who we bought from Barnsley in 2013 when he was 18) or bring up home-grown players like Ross Barkley (who joined Everton's training academy as a 11 year old) to develop and nurture them. 

It can be frustrating to watch as these young players go through their growing pains, some never pan out, the ones who do develop are often inconsistent, mentally fragile and go through patches where they lack confidence or get injured. It's a process that takes a long time and requires a lot of patience and faith before it bears fruit. But if the process works out and the players develop, then what you have is a core team of young players who are all getting better together and hitting their primes at the same time. In footie/soccer, the prime years of a player are usually from the time they are 22 until their late 20's.

That's essentially what's happened in the last 2-3 years as RM and Everton has committed to acquiring, developing and giving playing time to players. Some of them have broken through, other are in the midst of breaking out. The ones who have broken through, we have to manage to convince them to believe in each other and stay with our team. 

Many of them are given raises and the opportunity for more playing time to further develop. Otherwise they get poached by richer teams. Wayne Rooney, arguably England's best player in the last decade, was originally an Evertonian since he was 9 and was poached by Man United for a record £25 million pounds (in 2004) when he was just 19. It was heart breaking for Evertonians and many still have not forgiven him for requesting a ""transfer"" to a much richer team.

But I digress, what's really gratifying is seeing this long-term plan play out, seeing these players develop together, and choosing to stay with Everton (signing long-term contract extensions). Everton has one of the youngest teams with talented players expected to either start or play significant minutes in crucial roles:

* Romelu Lukaku - 22, we invested and believed in him when Chelsea did not. We paid the highest transfer fee we've ever paid in club history £28 million and broke the bank to acquire him from Chelsea. He's signed until 2019  
* John Stones -  21, acquired from Barnsley in 2013 for £3 million pounds, he's now worth at least 10 times that amount at £30 million. He's got the make up and leadership qualities to be a future Captain of the England national team. Keeping Stones is a major drama this offseason and is it's own soap opera
* Ross Barkley - 21, born in Liverpool and grew up an Everton fan, playing for his hometown team since 11. Highest ceiling and potential as any player in England. Barkley had a breakout 2014 season and could've been the next young starlet to leave town like Rooney. Instead, he stayed loyal to his childhood team and Roberto Martinez and resigned until 2018
* James McCarthy - 24, steady, reliable and experienced despite his youth - having already started 180 games in the premier league. He was courted by Man United since Jan of 2015, he resigned with Everton this summer for 5 years until 2020
* Seamus Coleman - 26, he's older and has blossomed into a star and top right back. He epitomizes a lottery ticket - we bought him from an Irish team for £60,000 pounds and Arsenal and Man Utd offered us £25 million pounds in 2014. Everton said no, and Coleman signed a 5 year contract extension to 2019. Seamus was a big reason we finished in the top 5 in 2014.   
* Brendan Galloway - 19, thrown in the fire with Leighton Baines injury. We'll see if he sinks or swims. 
* Muhamed Besic - 22, talented, fiery defensive midfielder caught Martinez's eye at the 2014 World Cup when he was Bosnia's youngest player and was given the assignment of covering the best player on Earth versus Argentina's Leonel Messi.
* Gerard Deulofeu - 21, He was a hot-shot prospect for Barcalona who we loaned in 2013 only to be returned to Barcalona in 2014. He loved his time so much at Everton, he pushed to get sold back to us in 2015. He plays with confidence (sometimes too much), flair and style. He's a wildcard that could either flame out or finally mature into a star.
* Luke Garbutt - 22, He's seen as Baines successor, everyone expected Garbutt to leave this year because he was seeking more playing time and had Baines and Oviedo blocking him for at Left Back. Surprisingly, RM convinced him to sign an extension until 2020. Unfortunately, we loaned him out for the whole year to Fulham without a claw-back clause before Baines came down with the injury.

If we're going off seasonal performances Gomez should be ahead of Creswell who has been abysmal so far. 

If we're going off of general players then Firmino should be ahead of Lallana and Reid is extremely questionable above Sakho.

I actually think it's an even toss up between Adrian and Migs too. 

My Lineup for in general, not this season form;

                             Adrian 

      Clyne         Skrtel            Sakho      Creswell

                    Henderson         Milner

       Payet               Firmino             Coutinho

                           Benteke


    The three behind Benteke would be fluid.

or on current season form;

                              Migs

     Clyne         Skrtel            Lovren        Gomez

1. Jose just sticks with his normal starting midfield triangle of Matic, Fabregas, and Oscar. This seems unlikely as he doesn't think there is enough defensive cover in that lineup. That is more a midfield used to play lesser teams who try and sit deep against us.

2. Start Mikel and Matic together in the pivot and drop one of Oscar/Fabregas, more likely being Oscar. This creates a tactical hinderance though because Mikel, while good at his job of breaking up attacks and shielding the back 4, does not do those things better than Matic, and while he can pass the ball around relatively well, is not offering you anything going forward whatsoever, and so that means Matic has to be the midfielder that makes the more forward runs, and that is taking him away from his strength, and his strengths, he does better than Mikel. 

3. Start Ramires in the pivot alongside Matic. This is usually what Jose opts for because it gives him the most balance between attack and defense. Ramires offers more defense than Oscar does, whilst possessing a set of iron lungs and a great work rate, he can also push forward and will make runs into the box. However, Ramires is exposed in the middle of the pitch because of his lack of any technical ability whatsoever, and often times that hurts us in attack. 

None of those really, are good options. Which is why I want us to buy a central midfielder who is a physical presence that can break up play alongside Matic, but also offers something going forward, which Witsel does because of his dribbling ability and his range of pass.

They're getting a very good deal from London Underground, but there are certain things LU are refusing to promise they won't do to employees. Things such as increased hours, working a night shift into an early shift. Basic things that they think throwing money at workers will fix.

Trouble is in this one little sentence you've told me more about it than I've seen glancing over media. I'm not going to read up tonnes on it - it's not in my interests (TBH, I don't use trains that much these days) but I am interested to see if they have a valid case for it... 

&gt; But more to the point exercising your right to strike is a fundamentally important part of working rights that we should be proud of. 

The trouble is *I* don't have a right to strike. Or a reason to. I'm the inconvenienced party that can't get my train. Their strike does *nothing* for me. 

I think what I just said represents a vast majority of people. The only thing they get from these people exercising their rights to strike is a delayed commute or inconvenience... they don't benefit. 

&gt; It's important that we do this so that large corporations don't lose sight of what's really important.

Well again... that's great for the workers, but in the grand scheme of the rail service those workers are actually the minority and the customers are the majority. 

Striking for a just cause is a fine thing, but as a paying customer (who is already putting up with lackluster rail services, delays and ticket price hikes) it's hard to feel too much sympathy for *quibbling* matters. 

What I'm trying to establish above is whether they genuinely are quibbling or whether it matters enough to go 'alright, the rail companies need to sort their shit out so that workers can go back to work and I can get my train again..'.

I think it may have been a Malagutti but my Dad painted it's tank red and put on a Ducati sticker to match his 851. I enjoyed it for a while but it soon died and I never did enough odd jobs to pay for a fix

2. 14, went halves with my dad on a minimoto on an impulse buy. Fun, fuel line broke and nearly set me on fire. Sold. 

3. 21, Ideas of passing my CBT and getting an RS 125 or Yamaha R125, ended up with £400 Honda XR125. Abused that thing for 3 years, put 14,500 miles on it as my sole transport. Even rode it to Scotland! 

4. 24, finally passed my DAS test after holding a job for a while. Got a brand new ER6n in matte black after almost getting an MT-03. Did the job, loved it to begin with. Ultimately a bit dull without spending a lot on mods. 

5. 25, this summer traded in the ER6n which cleared the remaining finance. Picked up a new Ducati Scrambler Full Throttle. 

It's not massively practical. Does 5 less mpg than the ER. (55 instead of 60, oh no!!!) less room for the girlfriend, tyres cost more and so does servicing, which it needs more often. 

I care not one bit. It makes the right noises and makes my 20 minute commute fun EVERY time. I hop on it every chance I get, already been around Scotland and it's quick enough to surprise the people I've ridden with. After all, it's still an 800cc twin in the compact little bike. It's not perfect but I like it enough that I think a few mods might be worth it. 

Next up... I'd love a Diavel but I'm not sure I could put it through a winter, so means keeping a second bike. ",null,0,null,1440703197,null,null,false,0,cuhsne5,null,t3_3ij7do,null,null,null,t3_3ij7do,null,null,null,1441534340,null,1,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

There is no evidence to suggest that legally held firearms represent any relative risk to the public, but I suppose we're only ignoring that factor when it comes to firearms, right?

&gt; Indeed the UK has some of the safest roads in the world despite very crowded roads, high vehicle ownership AND an affluent population that can afford high performance cars.

And yet shootings using legally held guns being practically non-existent seems to be ignored in this instance. Righty then...

&gt;The UK is a world leader in vehicle design for road and motorsport innovation. We export these skills and the products they generate around the globe. Cars, and fast cars are a huge economic sector worth £9Bn a year and involving 45,000 companies and one you'd be unwise to bring an end to.(that's just high performance cars and motorsports, not 'cars' as a whole).

That's cars in general, not fast cars. Plus, shooting sports and sales brought jobs and revenue to the UK, but again it seems we're ignoring this factor in firearms only. Right-o....

&gt;But ultimately, cars are a necessary evil. We all rely on them for transport to work, and for leisure. We accept the loss of life because the benefits personally, socially and economically outweigh the costs.

Sure, but I'm not talking about all cars just as you're not talking about all guns. Cars with 350bhp and 3L engines are not ""necessary at all"" and only come with costs. Yet apparently we ban them.

Thing is, they don't represent any *actual* relative risk to the public. We have tons of potentially dangerous thing (in the wrong hands) that we are fine with.

I'm not going to read up tonnes on it - it's not in my interests (TBH, I don't use trains that much these days) but I am interested to see if they have a valid case for it... 

This is a very long reply from someone who isn't interested in reading up on it. You can't be opinionated and not educate yourself.

&gt;The trouble is *I* don't have a right to strike. Or a reason to. I'm the inconvenienced party that can't get my train. Their strike does *nothing* for me. 

That's a very selfish view that people working for your convenience should withhold their own views for the benefit of yourself.

&gt;I think what I just said represents a vast majority of people. The only thing they get from these people exercising their rights to strike is a delayed commute or inconvenience... they don't benefit. 

I don't think it does, hence why this hasn't been upvoted. You're venting your anger at the wrong party. Don't vent at the people standing up, vent at the people forcing them to sit down. How would you feel if your company chose to change your hours, but refused to promise that you wouldn't work more than your contracted hours. Or refused to promise that you wouldn't be expected to work a night shift into an early shift, potentially expecting you to work 12 hours flat?

&gt;Well again... that's great for the workers, but in the grand scheme of the rail service those workers are actually the minority and the customers are the majority.

What makes you think this is great for the workers? Do you honestly think they'd rather risk their own jobs than just go to work? This isn't an ideal situation for anyone. It's not about majorities or minorities; it's about the companies biggest assets making a stand.

&gt;Striking for a just cause is a fine thing, but as a paying customer (who is already putting up with lackluster rail services, delays and ticket price hikes) it's hard to feel too much sympathy for *quibbling* matters. 

At no fault of the rail workers. They don't control ticket prices, or train delays.

&gt;What I'm trying to establish above is whether they genuinely are quibbling or whether it matters enough to go 'alright, the rail companies need to sort their shit out so that workers can go back to work and I can get my train again..'.

And they're striking because the rail companies aren't saying this. Quite the opposite.

Anything which isn't handled by it is automatically handled by the devolved parliaments, with Westminster effectively becoming one itself once it's UK-wide responsibilities are removed.

Lauren, mate, do me a favour and read what i wrote before you reply next time.

I asked you two simple questions and you couldnt answer either of them. You then argued back against shit i havent even said. Seriously.

First question:
Where did anybody say it was permanent unemployment? 

(answer it this time please or there's no point in me even bothering to reply. Ill just downvote)

Reason:
If he isnt permanently unemployed then it would be more beneficial for him to recover without the pressure of applying for 30+ jobs a week that he isnt qualified for and risk being sanctioned.

Question 2:
Have you ever been unemployed?

Reason:
It seems you do not understand the unemployment system and are repeating the ""living a life on benefits"" lines as seen in the Daily Mail.",null,0,null,1440704434,null,null,false,0,cuhth85,null,t3_3il806,null,null,null,t1_cuhsuqo,null,null,null,1441534731,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

They're not working for my convenience, they're being paid. It's a job. They are paid to do a job and provide a service which - by striking - I and many others will not be getting. 

Yes it's selfish, but so is the striking. It doesn't seem to be for customer benefit? 

&gt; You're venting your anger at the wrong party. Don't vent at the people standing up, vent at the people forcing them to sit down.

Again the question of *why* comes up. OP quoted a link to me that the introduction of new high speed trains (good for me as a customer!) would - in the eyes of the workers - mean less jobs, hence the strike. Officials claim there will in fact be *more* jobs. Who is right? 

&gt; it's about the companies biggest assets making a stand.

Hate to say it, but that'd be the customers and their stand is mostly 'Oh great, more strikes...'. 

&gt; And they're striking because the rail companies aren't saying this. Quite the opposite. 

Again this depends on *what that shit is*. If I chose to strike tomorrow because my boss won't give me another two weeks holiday a year and a £10k pay rise then those affected by my strike might take a dim view of my choices. *It's up to the rail workers to present hard facts that they're being hard done by enough to make a strike worthwhile, otherwise I wouldn't be surprised that customers do not take their side*.

Ibe needs some time to cool off, and regain his cool and confidence which he oozed off, thereby allowing Marko to show what he's truly made up of.

I've always been nauseated by how fixated we are as a species by those two things, at the expense of almost everything else, but to see both things offered side by side is just beyond creepy. It's like that bizarre American magazine called something like ""Girls &amp; Corpses.""

I think about this a lot, since I'm obviously as thrilled by both things as the next person. Sex is kind of a given, and there's nothing wrong with being attracted to sexual imagery, but our fascination with tragedy, particularly how it seems like the more grisly and disturbing the more it attracts us, is kind of pitiful and depressing.

Except that We have no idea if that one person's sad death had anything to do with the system. They could have died from a road traffic accident or in bed from a stroke. The only way to find out whether the system is contributing to their deaths is by examining the figures.

From the blog post that /u/okem kindly posted from https://fullfact.org/economy/dwp_publishes_benefit_claimant_deaths-47572

&gt; We should be careful in interpreting these figures

&gt; The figures show some interesting results. In 2013, about 140 out of every 100,000 Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) claimants died compared with 240 people in the general population. What we shouldn’t infer from this is that claiming JSA lowers your chance of dying.

&gt; Similarly, the mortality rate for people claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) who are put in the work related activity group is more than twice as high as the mortality rate for the general population, at 530 per 100,000. This doesn’t mean that being placed in the work related activity group causes higher mortality; another explanation is that the people put in this group are more likely to have conditions which raise their mortality rates (allowing them to claim ESA) but which aren’t severe enough to qualify them for the support group.

The DoubleTree wasn't thrilling but it was clean and in a pretty good location for the 216 bus (which goes to the stadium).  

The Malmaison is also convenient and it used to be really nice but they hadn't done much with it the last time I stayed there so it was looking a little worse for wear.

The Brittania is chintzy as fuck, but it's also just a short walk to the 216 stop.

I really like the Radisson Edwardian but it's sometimes a little pricey and it's not the most convenient for getting to the stadium (but again town isn't massive).

The Midland is a bit of a classic.  IIRC it looked *really* dated inside, but legend (aka my gran, who was definitely a legend) has it that Hitler liked it so much that he was going to make it his UK residence if he'd taken all of Europe.

The Lowry is pricey and is a nice hotel but you definitely feel like you're in rag territory (but Lowry himself was a Man City fan so it's swings and roundabouts).

Doesn't that strike you as odd in any way that a man who is supposed to be principled to a fault has so many scummy friends?

My point is that we shouldn't judge Corbyns friends and associates on hearsay and speculation when there's enough evidence out there in the open already, if you read past the shortened quote of mine you'd have seen me make this point already, which makes me think you're deliberately misrepresenting my point, you wouldn't be doing that, would you?

&gt;*or* we can go by what he has said in public, verified by video, admitted by the man himself, that he chooses to associate with, and be close personal friends with people that have outdated, backwards beliefs about homosexuals. That doesn't mean Corbyn is a homophobe, it just means that he's the kind of guy that is prepared to look past homophobia and make long lasting, strong friendships.

The rest of my paragraph, for those who don't want to scroll up.

If he does not need to rely on the state for income and is able to generate his own income, then he should.

Beneficial to whom? If he is able to work then he should attempt to seek and secure work. Let's not exaggerate with the 30+ jobs claim. From what I understand the number of jobs for which a claimant is expected to apply is at the advisor's discretion. Obviously, given his condition, I expect them to be lenient.

&gt;Tottenham are baffled by Peace’s accusations, and there is no little anger behind the scenes at White Hart Lane. As far as they are concerned, they opened talks with Albion well before they made their opening offer on Tuesday of last week and the way that they have structured the payments for Berahino is no different to how Albion have proposed to pay for Federico Fazio, the Tottenham centre-half that Pulis wants to sign. Albion have offered a package worth £5m for him. That deal is obviously now in jeopardy.

&gt;Tottenham have noted how Albion have signed two new strikers this summer – Rickie Lambert and Salomón Róndon – to go with their existing options in Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe while they accept no blame for how Berahino has become unsettled. It has been West Brom who have made public the bids for him, and how he put in a transfer request, which has made things difficult between him and the fans. Tottenham cannot understand why Peace has sought to make everything so public.

&gt;The London club are ready to move on and they are close to finalising the £22m signing of Son Heung-min from Bayer Leverkusen. The South Korean is recognised more as a goal-scoring attacking midfielder, who tends to play off the left but can operate in any of the positions behind the striker. Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, also believes he could be an option as a striker.

However the season is still young. Time will tell how much game time Iheanacho will get this season, but my gut tells me he won't get much considering how Manuel has been with youth in the past. 

I remember one game a few seasons ago we were up 5-0 against someone with 10 mins to go. Instead of subbing on Guidetti who was anxious to prove himself coming off his injury, Manuel subbed on Javi Garcia. 

With the spending we've done this summer, everyone expects us to go far in every competition we are in. Judging from his past tendencies, I think Manuel will play Sterling out of position as a makeshift striker instead of giving Kelechi a start.

&gt;Also just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean I'm narrow minded. What I've asked for are the facts, rather than *narrow mindedly* assuming that because there's a strike, the strikers must be right. 

You're being narrow minded because you're only seeing the impact of these things on *yourself*

&gt;Again because I'm not agreeing with you, I have no empathy? Ok. I like to know why I'm being empathetic too, by the way... and I'd also like to know how many of those striking workers have spared a thought for me and the disruption it's caused me. It works both ways, after all. 

They don't spare a thought about you because their working conditions are more important than you being inconvenienced 1-3 days out of 365. This isn't about you.

&gt;&gt; But, by all means, do away with strikes. Just don't complain to me when your working week is 90 hours and you earn barely enough for a loaf of bread.

A helpful tip: the little notches on each side of the swing arm can be slightly off. For precision (you don't want to misalign your wheels) get a vernier caliper and measure the threads sticking out from the nuts. If these are equal, you should be golden! 

One more thing, **do not forget to retighten the axle nut**. You don't want to ride off without doing that, trust me. 

My knowledge of technical terms is absolute wank, so if someone could pop in with the proper terms for things like those little nuts and the sticking out thread bits it would be much appreciated.

They could even abolish them unilaterally if they wanted, although they wouldn't do that for obvious reasons.

The UK going down a federal route would necessarily mean that the power that Westminster has and the powers the devolved parliaments have would be clearly defined, and the sovereignty of Westminster would be limited. Sovereignty would be shared between Westminster and the devolved nations.

I think it's important that Westminster remains the main parliament for England, it is iconic, and people in England have a different and perhaps more personal relationship with it compared to people in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, and honestly I think it's fair to say that the Westminster parliament has always been a bit of a ""Greater England"" parliament, and always will be since England makes up 85% of the UK population, there's no way around it.

If there is a new federal parliament then I do think it needs to be held outside Westminster, it needs to be far smaller and leaner, and needs to have only a few small but important responsibilities. And again it needs to be seen as more of a meeting place for the four nations, a council in a sort of ""British Union"", for example.

Basically Rodgers targeted both Bony and Sanchez to replace Suarez in the squad. Having failed to sign either player and nearing the end of the transfer window, the transfer committee gave BR a choice between signing Samuel E'to or Mario Balotelli to fill the vacant striker position. Balo seemed the better option due to his reduced transfer tag (16 mil down from 25 when he signed for Milan) and a good goal return for Milan during the past 2 seasons (1 in roughly 2 games). 
It was thought that because Rodgers had brought the best out of Suarez and Sturridge that Balo could experience the same revival at Liverpool.

That was awful, truly awful. We haven't posed a threat through the middle since Lallana left. This wasn't a problem when we had quality out wide in Clyne and Bertrand, but now, now we are completely blunt. Our entire attacking strategy revolved around two bang-average full backs delivering poor balls to a stationary Pelle. How the fuck is that acceptable?! I know Elia and Djuricic weren't the best but at least they offered something - the ability to take someone on, or a deft touch here and there. Now we have nothing. Nothing. Steven Davis a man who is so inoffensive he'd rather not score so as not to draw attention to himself. Prowse just sees things too late and doesn't have the ball control to make time for himself. Tadic has given up since that backheel against Liverpool on the first day of last season. It's just so fucking blunt and dull and every other adjective that makes knives shit.

Why can't we spend some money? Palace backed Pardew, a genuinely bad man, with shit loads of money. Why the fuck can't we do the same?

Let Southampton be a lesson to anyone out there thinking of challenging the establishment (Corbyn). Don't do it. Seriously, don't do it. It'll be exciting for a while; you'll start to feel hope, hope that things can change. But then you will be torn apart and fucked over and it will be shit. And the smug bastards (Liverpool/George Osborne) will fucking rub your noses in it.

But #WeMarchOn!!!  Never mind that the only possibly exciting aspect of this season is over, never mind that! I would have loved to go to some proper European away nights in the one year of my life that I properly could have, but, you know, too fucking late now.

Some comments concern me, like ""portray them in negative light due to their stupidity"".

A claim of ""X was stupid and it caused me £Y in damage"" is not a legal argument. A claim of ""X owed me a duty of care (evidence), they acted negligently in breach of said duty (evidence), as a result (evidence) I suffered £Y in damage (evidence)."" Is a legal argument. 

Your basis for claiming isn't clear (Tort? Contract?) but even if you can show what you say, that isn't enough to show they will have to pay. There are concepts like remoteness and mitigation. Mitigation means that if the gym renewal is costing you £500 for a year but it would have cost you £20 to get a taxi to go there in person to cancel then you should have done that and your damages are £20 not £500.

Based on the above I would go and try to get some advice, even if free advice from CAB. A judge will show some understanding if you get some things wrong, but you still need to plead a case will a legal basis.

Alderweireld, Clyne, Schneiderlin, Forster, Shaw, Lallana, Lambert and, if we're being blunt, the old Rodriguez. We've lost too many good players over two summers to maintain the cohesion we used to have. The utter failure to invest in any equivalent quality this summer has been criminal. 

But beyond that and more crucially (because we still should have had enough to win this over two legs), Koeman critically fucked up with his selection/tactics. J-Rod is nowhere near ready to start a crucial match like this, the 3-5-2 hoofball threw 50 minutes of the match into the bin; no pace in the team whatsoever, we barely played football until Tadic came on and we seriously need to wonder whether Koeman has any faith in Juanmi at all.

Now that the majority of 'those ones' (to be fair this applies to both sides) have all but packed away the guns and bombs etc and are now using the same methods of democracy and civilised society to end the status-quo here, there is dissent. The only rational explanation for this is that the 'conflict' was never about terrorists. It was entirely about affording one side more power than the other. They refused to integrate and share this country evenly then, they're being forced to now and they STILL don't like it.

Such jaundiced revisionism. Rational? Maybe if you're Brian Feeney...

Also teams didn't park it as much against Fulham so less lock picking type decisions. I'm glad he's still here but he could really excel at a club with more creativity from players off the ball (pretty sure Deuce was already here that year, but he's an example of a player Dembele excels with).

Very roughly 0.8% of the UK population died in 2013 (latest year I could find a figure for)


Again very roughly, and extrapolating from this data, 1.3% of ESA claimants will die in 2015.


Instantly it's obvious that this isn't double, (approx 1.5 times) and the roughness of my calculations along with the fact the death rate in the UK has likely risen significantly since 2013 (ageing population etc) and the fact that everyone does eventually die would likely make this 1.5 times number smaller

Finally the average health of someone on ESA is logically lower than the UK average so it's really not that surprising that their mortality rate is higher is it?


The mirror is sensationalising again, don't be drawn in by it.


 Edit: even if we ignore all the adjusters (poor health and increasing death rate) and assume immortality then this represents an error of 0.5% which is excellent when you compare it to the error rate of pretty much every other human operated process.

OK, but lots of British people support the palestinians.  Bit hard for me to understand why Corbyn would have to make friends with this particular bigot - or why it was necessary not to distance himself from Hewitt's views.

&gt;But my reading of Corbyn is that he's doing so because he wants to see peace and justice for the palestinian people.

So do I, but I don't think that's achieved by cosying up to the likes of British bigots.

&gt;If you've demonstrated against fox hunting in the past, have you associated with a communist?

If you decide to be 'very good friends' with a communist who has written books about how great communism is, and you never thought to question his ideas, then yes - I think you can be said to have  associated with a communist.  

Whether you think that Communism is necessarily a bad thing is a different question.  But, I assume you agree that calling for adulterers and homosexuals to get the lash or face the death penalty *is* a bad thing.

&gt;I think the ability to work that kind of thing out is kind of obvious for most people.

I agree!  Unfortunately for you however, I think that most people will agree with me that Corbyn's habit of repeatedly associating with various antisemites, holocaust deniers and terrorist sympathizers means that he's unfit to ever become prime-minister.

BTW - I don't dislike Corbyn.  I think he's probably quite a nice guy.  But not every nice guy should get to run the Labour party, let alone become a prime-minister.

In my old area in the UK there used to be loads of people who were benefits cheats. It was a poorer area and people simply saw it as a way of life. However, I realised this was not true for all of the UK and whilst areas like mine were full of them, other areas in the country were full of people in work. However, what I then saw was people in my area who worked resenting those that claimed benefits and believed it was representative of the entirety of the UK. There may not be a lot of people in percentages fraudulently claiming benefits yet due to these people being concentrated in certain parts of the country, it appears to many that its a massive problem.

As a left wing Eurosceptic socialist my attitude is that those who are able bodied to work should get a living public wage in response for helping the local community in some way. I do not believe in the current welfare model. Not because I think they are spongers, but because I do not think being stuck at home doing nothing is healthy for the body and mind and keeping busy is good for the individual. I also believe encouraging people to take pride in their local communities would help bring people together and more respectful of one another's contributions. Furthermore, I reject that it'll put people out of jobs because current evidence shows us that we need roads to be repaired, we need streets cleaned, we need graffiti removed, we need grass cut and we need to come together. I would rather pay people £200 per week to help out the local community than give them £72 per week to do nothing whilst continuing to shout at them to find work that simply does not exist.

It is completely possible to put everyone who is able to work into work. Nobody would be forced to take it up but those who rejected putting into their local communities wouldn't get back out.

2. I don't think so, yes I think he made it thinking it was his best bet, but I'm certain he didn't think it would get out and become public. Also, the fact that he played last night (regardless of if we have backup players in his position) and the fact he started crying last night apparently both suggest to me that Stones felt he had to do it and probably did it and regretted the manner of it.
3. He'll shine, hopefully Martinez will speak to him if he does end up staying (which I am expecting to) and help him with his options without his agent trying to money grab at Stones' expense. As I see it, he can go to Chelsea now but do we think Stones has ever dreamt of playing for Chelsea? I don't think so. Next year, after a good year of football he could open his options up to Chelsea, City, United, Arsenal, or even abroad. I really can see him at Barcelona to be honest, especially with their defence calling for some younger players.

null,null,bockers7,lfc12,,null,"""Another player putting earnings over achievements"" doesn't exist. Borini doesn't have a tie to Liverpool like a local kid would. Be honest with yourself, would you really give up that much money? It's not like he's making 10-20m a yr you know. He's making 2.8m a yr, which is quite a bit of money but it's not like he's super super rich. He's not buying a yacht or anything of that nature. If he drops his wages and never gets back up, he would be giving up a lot of money. If his career earnings are something like 20m, and he gives up 1.5m a year for the next three, that's 22.5% of all of his career earnings mate.

LFC are desperate and other clubs know that. We'll pay half his wages in the end, something Borini is not at fault for. He's just doing good business for him. Would you honestly go down to say 1.6m a yr knowing full well you'll get what you're being paid now in the end? No shot. 

Who says he's giving up football? He's not refusing to move or leave Liverpool. He just knows he wont have to give up on his wages if he waits long enough. Liverpool have no pull here, they already put him to practice by himself which was beyond stupid.  Either he takes a pay cut or we loan him out and pay a part of it. If he stays, he'll probably leave in January. You surely can't blame him for holding on to his money? What if he never makes that much? Football isn't a romance novel, it's a business. He could get hurt and boom it's over. 

Last year he wanted to prove himself which was very admiral and the fan base actually said, okay that's the trait we want to see lets see how he does. Now you're saying last yr was about money, which I dont remember his wages being brought up at all last year so Idk what you're going on about. 

All in all, Liverpool and Brendan did bad business with Borini, plain and simple. Blaming the player for not wanting to give up money he's already guaranteed is ridiculous. Why don't you blame the club for handing him that much in the first place? Borini is protecting his own, and why shouldn't he? LFC made a bad deal, now we need to find a way to fix it. Liverpool don't show loyalty to players they want gone, no club does, why should he take a pay cut and help us out? 

This is similar to all the crappy deals City were handing out when they first got big money. Adebayor, Rodwell, Jo, Santa Cruz, Robinho, Bellemy etc.. They had to bite the bullet and loan a lot of those players for a few years before finally selling them. That's just how it works nowadays. Blaming the player is ridiculous in my opinion, they are professionals more than anything and football is a business. We don't hand out big contracts just because someone is loyal and nice, why should we expect them to cut their wages when push comes to shove? 

I know we get upset bc we could have had 14m last year, but you need to look at the whole picture and not just looking at it from our side. ",null,0,null,1440710323,null,null,false,0,cuhxexv,null,t3_3imtzn,null,null,null,t1_cuhw7s4,null,null,null,1441536650,null,0,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

Hah. Have you SEEN a game? It's like 10 seconds of running around, then play stops for more than a minute to reset at whatever new position they are at. Then just about every 10 minutes (sometimes even more frequent) there's a commercial break, which of course lasts for 5 minutes or so.

Yeah, the game lasts for hours, but if you compressed a whole game down by cutting out all the non-play, you could probably fit all the action in 10 minutes or less. 10 minutes of running. Per game. No they're not friggin tired.

The only ones of the four big american sports I have any respect for in terms of physical achievements is basketball and ice hockey. And football of course, but it's not that big.

American football is just tactics and muscles. Not stamina. Baseball is all about technique. Not stamina.

Edit: I wrote 15 minutes at first, but then I did maths. It's 10.

Edit2: Actually some might be tired, but if they are, that's more from being unfit than actually working too hard.

Edit3: For the downvoters who don't like facts:

From http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/64441086/nfl-statistical-analysis-average-nfl-game

&gt; The average football game is actually longer than the average baseball game. According to The Boston Globe, baseball games average 2 hours, 57 minutes and 33 seconds. This isn't to suggest baseball is inherently more exciting. But one of the contemporary knocks against baseball is its games take too long. It's curious that few complain about NFL game lengths, considering they take 13 minutes longer, more time than the **11 total minutes of actual game play during an NFL game**. In other words, you could fit all the action of an average NFL game into the spare time after an average baseball game ends.

Sadly, given the attitude I got when I applied to do voluntary work while on JSA ""Well, I supposed you can, but you'll have to fill this form out, we'll have to contact the employer and if for a moment we think it is interfering with your jobsearch or you do more than 16 hours in a week, there'll be possible sanctions""...

I don't see this government getting people to do the work they may be capable of doing unless it's either profitable to private business, or a nasty punishment to the claimant in a bid to make claiming so horrible they quit (workfare/sanctions/daily signing etc.)

But you're right. I was riding far too close. 

I don't think it's predictable that a car travelling at 40mph stops with approximately 0.4 seconds warning (pretty sure that's what it was, I could check again because I didn't write it down). What you can see is how much its rear suspension extends when it hits the brakes. There was no right for them to take, and no traffic crossing into its path. They just did a little nose-stand for shits and giggles as far as I can tell. 

Still, it was a bit dickish to ride that close - which is why I acknowledge that with the text on the screen and the words in your ears.

The second time, I was very tired. My front tyre was a little low on wear. I'd been riding for quite some time through exhaustingly blocked-up roads. I got distracted by Windsor castle, then glanced into a garden and missed the car in front's lights go red. I panic braked (first time I've ever yanked like that, and hopefully the last - though on ABS now). Minor crash, wrote off the bike. The lady was fine and friendly and accepted my apology and we texted nice things to one another later. I even showed her the video and explained that it was all my fault.

In the third I braked and downshifted, then released it, hit the clutch (hence that rev sound), and turned; because a car in front of the one I was following had stopped in the middle of a long dual carriageway. Whether it'd stalled or what, I don't know. There appeared to be no reason. I'd just shoulder checked so I knew I had room to the left, which I still consider to be a fairly safe manoeuvre. If I'd have jumped on the ABS brakes, I would've stopped in time, but that would've exposed me to the possibility of being rear-shunt-sandwiched by a car behind me with slower reactions. A particularly deadly place to be for a motorcyclist, I'm sure you'll agree.

I then duly chastised myself for not riding too close still. I believe there's a section of me shouting at myself. Perhaps you missed that bit. I'm not sure what part of swearing at yourself in a helmet for riding poorly, or writing it up on the screen, suggests I was making a joke. I lost a bike I liked and fucked my shoulder so it still sucks reaching up for things on high shelves and doing victory dances but otherwise am fine thank you.

null,null,logical_outcome,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"Before the management restructuring, depending on the store's weekly earnings, we used to have Dept Managers &gt; Assistant Dept Managers &gt; Supervisors &gt; Assistants. This was spread over every dept, again depending on weekly earnings of specific dept. Over the past 5/6 years as people left the company they weren't replaced, the management team ended up picking up the bulk of the work (ie; not managing) and it left Morrisons with too many chiefs and very few Indians. In my store, we actually lost (quitting or moving to other stores) more Dept Managers than assistants, so the supervisors had to take it on the chin and run the dept's without the actual pay. It is entirely justifiable that the shareholders and bigwigs decided, we need to do something about this, we're spending too much money on management and it's hurting our profits. It unfortunately makes business sense. We need to be more like Lidl or Aldi who operate on the minimum when it comes to staff and management, despite offering half the services a supermarket like Morrisons or Sainsburys offers. 

Cue the restructure; newly created Team Managers take on 3 or 4 depts as opposed to just the 1 under the old regime, get paid less and work more hours. They don't have access to a network of people, no supervisors to run the depts when they are on days off, or holiday. No assistant managers to rely on to keep things ticking over, the idea being that all the money generated from the people who lost their jobs, the brass would reinvest in assistants. More hours on the shop floor, management are managing again. However this never materialised, the Team Managers end up doing the bulk of the work again, filling in the gaps left by low staffing, because the company cares more about it's profit margins than it does about providing a great shopping experience and customer service (although this doesn't stop the area managers from getting their knickers in a twist when our counters have no staff and no stock on shelves, despite the fact they are the ones who refuse to allow our GM's to recruit new people).

Sometimes I find that the job is worth it, it just depends on the circumstances. I'm currently the Manager of Meat and Fish and honestly I love serving customers and providing them with best service I can. Same goes for my team. While I've been dropped into the deep end by taking over the dept after the restructure with no training, I've done my best to keep things going. However, for the money, hours (46 minimum) and stress it's not worth it. The job satisfaction only goes so far when your life revolves around work.

Alas, that is retail.

These were people who the DWP declared to be fit for work. That means by the DWP's own admission, long-term health issues and terminal illnesses *should not have been a factor*. If it turns out that health issues were responsible, *then that reflects badly on the DWP for declaring them fit for work when they clearly were not*.

I don't understand why so many people are burying their heads in the sand on this one. We know that a large number of people claiming ESA are among the poorest demographics in society. We already have documented instances of what happens when the DWP has sanctioned or taken benefits away from those on low incomes. We have documented evidence of ATOS making a pig's ear of things (around 40% of their work capability assesments were overturned on appeal), and *they themselves ended up ending the contract with the government early*. These figures do not exist in a vacuum, they exist in the context of a highly ineffective department that has faced criticism from the media and from the courts for how it has run things.

Joe Allen is an experienced veteran who has shown what he can offer.  He isn't expected to improve.  He is a reliable squad player that can be turned to when needed.  Markovic can have all the potential in the world.  However, that potential has yet to materialize and it has been determined he needs to feature regularly in order to harness his potential.

&gt; We've seen the best out of him and he most likely will never be anything but a role player.

No shit... and what teams don't have role players?  Is Mikel a fucking world beater?  Is Ramires expected to develop into Deco?  Were Darren Fletcher, De Jong, Park Ji Sung, Dirk Kuyt, or Craig Bellamy much more than role players?  No, but they were definitely valuable players in their sides.

&gt; He's getting minutes over someone who could actually use them to build on his abilities.

THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY THE SAME POSITION.  What the fuck are you honestly rambling about?

&gt;Minimize Harm

&gt;Ethical journalism treats sources, subjects, colleagues and members of the public as human beings deserving of respect.

&gt;Journalists should:

&gt;    - Balance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness.

&gt;    - Show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles, victims of sex crimes, and sources or subjects who are inexperienced or unable to give consent. Consider cultural differences in approach and treatment.

&gt;    - Recognize that legal access to information differs from an ethical justification to publish or broadcast.

&gt;    - Realize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures and others who seek power, influence or attention. Weigh the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information.

&gt;    - Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do.

&gt;    - Balance a suspect’s right to a fair trial with the public’s right to know. Consider the implications of identifying criminal suspects before they face legal charges.

&gt;    - Consider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication. Provide updated and more complete information as appropriate.

No. No it doesn't. All it means is they were 'fit for work' by the WCA's standards... ""fit for work"". As in, they could move a certain distance, lift a certain weight, find their way around unaided, make certain decisions. The stat itself means absolutely nothing in isolation.

Yes, the number is high as a proportion of the roughly 900k applications per year. And it warrants further investigation. However I would question whether the type of person likely to claim, has a certain risk of death attached to them and whether this mortality rate is higher or larger than what is to be expected of that group. Demographers however are likely to be equally as perplexed as the data they require has simply not been released due to the nature of the FoI request wording.

I agree with most of what you say, but unfortunately I just do not see the relevance.

Yes, there have been documented fatalities as a result of the DWP's actions. Yes we can agree that aspects of the system are rigged unfairly and punatively.

However we cannot say, with any degree of certainty, that the ~3k of people declared as fit for work which died, did so as a direct result of the DWP.

I'm not disappointed at the failure or the lack of a cup run, I am disappointed at the passing of an opportunity to achieve success.

I've said it before and I will say it again now and for the rest of the season: At the start of the summer we were the 7th best team in the Premier League, we bought players that Norwich could have signed and now we are unable to sign the top players as they all have new club or aren't interested. 

If we were in this position (out of europe and a shocking start to the league) but we had spent 50 million and had Payet, Shaqiri, Austin, Toby and Nzonzi I would have patience, I would be calm and would happily wait for the success.

However, the current team isn't good enough to do well and no matter how much you try and gel the team it still lacks quality. We were in crisis before the Newcastle game kicked off, we are in crisis now and will be for the season unless someone gets the cash out.

I did an ATOS test myself between a period of ill health, moving to ESA, JSA, then onto work, and my own experience was that the test was badly planned and that some of the people being assessed were so obviously not fit that a standard e-mail to their doctor or psychiatrist would have reassured that. Personally I found it unsuitable as it was basically a list of questions ""on a scale of 1 to 10......"" which was asked of everyone whether they were learning disabled, physically disabled, mentally ill, etc so you do get asked some very strange things and it is all very bureaucratic rather than having an element of care such as you would find from a doctor or therapy. It does feel very much like an inquisition, and becomes more so if you move to an appeal which can end up with you being questioned by a selection of government officials in what feels like a trial, whilst on your side you have an official from a charity who wants you to give the strongest account of yourself on the day. The individual is in the middle being pulled from either side. I was advised to keep fighting an appeal but had had enough by that point so just abandoned it all against the wishes of my doctor and psychiatrist. Looking back, it was the wrong thing to do and I was in no way fit for work at that stage. No surprise I didn't get a job for several years until I was fully recovered.

I think what should have happened is that the DWP should have contacted the GPs/psychiatrists/social workers or whichever government employees were dealing with the individual and asked (with advice given in email) whether the individual was in a position to be tested. Then you strike off the most ""unfit"" without putting them through any additional stress. You have no idea how dangerous additional stress can be to someone recovering from mental illness or breakdown. But the people devising these tests should have known.

A friend then got involved with a mental health charity which I did some volunteering for and I heard some disturbing stories of the effects these tests had on individuals, and met a few myself (one guy was practically psychotic) so I've been expecting this to become a bigger story at some point.

My own feelings are that they decided to cut the welfare budget - nothing wrong with that if it's done with some care. They then devised the most uncaring test in order to push as many people in vulnerable positions to voluntarily sign off of their support, against expert's wishes, thinking only about the money saved rather than the overall cost on people and I find that a bit distasteful.

Take the colour off, just use black writing on white, and only use bold and spacing for emphasis (no underlines, differnet fonts, etc., although yours seems good for that).

You may want to add an address - you could put this under your name where your email/phone number are, probably with address in one column and email/phone in another to save space.

Remove the background information section entirely - if it's relevant to what you're applying for, you should put it in a cover letter. If it's not, you're probably better without advertising the fact that you're intendng this to be short time so strongly. You don't need to explicitly state your age, although readers will infer it from the education dates.

Put Sixth form above high school, since it's more recent. It's up to you whether educaton or work experience is first  since it's all concurrent, but probably whichever is more relevant to what you're applying for (you can vary it for different applications if need be).

The professional skills section is tricky as it doesn't have any back up...how do they know that you are skilled at motivating coworkers? If you can, it might work better if you can highlight these skills within the experience section rather that as a seperate part. This may mean putting more detail into the experience section.

Make sure that whatever you have on there exactly fills the page (or, if you must go over, exactly fills two pages - but at your level you ought to be able to do it in one), to avoid people thinking that you couldn't find anything else good to say. You can easily do this without writing anything else just by increasing spacing slightly between sections.

As someone else has said, it's ""Education and Qualifications"". Similarly ""Interests"", although you may want to rephrase that as ""Other Interests"" or simply ""Hobbies"" to avoid the implication that you're not interested in the education or work. ""Giving attention to details"" sounds weird - just say attention to detail.

Also, in hobbies, although I appreciate this may just have been for anonymity - give the name of the team, don't just say local team.

In work experience, you may need to rephrase ""delegated tasks for students..."" - was it actually delegation (as in managing your workload by giving appropriate parts away) or was it assigning/setting tasks for them to do for you?

It really disrupted my sleep pattern, and if you complain they just brush it off as not a big deal.

Well since Pogba would be the future of the club. Sure. We are spending 70m on a player that will hopefully be around for 10 years. Its a great investment. He won't be a typical ""bench warmer"" lol. There is a difference between a player who is used off the bench and a player who warms the bench.

&gt;I am seriously try to understand how 70 million figure doesn't seem  anything to you.  Maybe when you start working, get into the real world you might realise the significance of the value of money.  This isn't FIFA you are playing.

I'm 26 years old. I've been working for 10 years of my life. It's a 70m investment. It will be well worth it and have a return rate of much more. Even if he is not an automatic starter his first season.

&gt;As to what Mourinho might or might not do, did you speak to him recently?  Are you sure he 'might' get a lot of minutes?  Man, you really are the genius you claim to be.  xD

Do you know what Abramovich would do? Both sides of this conversation we are having is us making assumptions. I'm going off his history and Pogba's talent. Also, I'm going off how Jose has made his formations for typical games since he arrived. He will get a lot of minutes. Especially in big games when we switch formations to less attacking.

So let me take your example to illustrate my point by using the same maths for whether someone which works from home should take an office job.

- £210 a month from employment with 8 hours per week.

- As a result loses £67.35 from UC. However gets £463 (uc+work) instead of £317 (uc full). Positive difference of about £46 pcm for working.

- His standard business-hour time is thus worth roughly £7.92 ph on UC alone (317/40).

- He also loves his nephew dearly and spends all his personal time with him. He values this, personally, at £3 p/h.

- Mr Z works 8 hours per week, at 2 hours per day.

- Incurring a train fair of £6 return (because he lives somewhere with cheap trains). This works out at £96 pcm (16*6). This, without any further consideration, has wiped out Mr Z's benefit of working over full UC. If he could do 4 hours a day, twice a week, this would still be a net negative.

But lets continue anyway...

- Travel time takes 1 hour door to door each way. Combined with the 30 minutes per day preparing clothes, eating enough, etc. 2.5 * £3 = £7.5 per day... £120pcm (personal time rate).

- He also has to goto bed earlier, as he is more active due to work. This takes out a further hour a day... £56pcm

We can look at other factors, like socialisation, networking, stress. And benefits like career advancement, relationships, etc. But for simplicity sake...

- Mr Z is thus spending £96 directly to support going to work. Which results in £50 less than he would have had staying on UC.

- And spending £176 pcm worth of his personal time, supporting his working life in general.

Not convinced on the whole little section actually. If I was employing someone, I'd want to see clear indications of what exactly your responsibilities were in that job, whereas the section you've written seems to hover halfway between that and a sort of highlight of key skills. Your section for your time spent as a tutor is much more what I'd be looking for in bulletpoints beneath prior employment. If you washed cars at your valet job, say you washed cars. It makes more sense, make your key skills and abilities section separate and don't repeat phrases.
