I'm not saying I don't want to see world class players like them in our squad, but the club has promised to focus on youth. How is our youth supposed to get a legitimate chance when whenever there's a hole in our squad we just drop 20 million to fix the problem?

We've just spent all this money on our new academy so I hope that's a statement of intent that we will one day see players from Manchester playing for City.

**Price of product:** £10 for set of three deluxe samples

**Where did you purchase:** Latest in Beauty website

**Product claims:** *""Your anti-oxidant shield for the day
This multi-purpose Polyphenol + Vitamin C anti-oxidant and anti-wrinkle treatment also contains sun filters to protect against UVA and UVB rays.*

*Enriched with hyaluronic acid, it also has a plumping action. As soon as it is applied, the skin is smoother, more filled out and perfectly protected all day long. The tangy and fresh fragrance notes awaken all the senses. Non-comedogenic. Dermatologist tested.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased on the strength of the name/ active ingredients (polyphenols and Tetra-C) and [Caroline Hirons blog post.] (http://www.carolinehirons.com/2014/04/caudalie-polyphenol-c15.html)

**Your opinion:** In testing this product I decided to give the line the chance to work as it was formulated to: together. I tried to get hold of samples of the Overnight Detox Oil but had a distinctly UNhelpful response from Caudalie when I enquired as to where samples could be purchased in the UK (they are all over US eBay).

I also dropped most of my other skincare products whilst testing so initially I only used Una Brennan Vitamin C+ cleansing oil, the three Caudalie samples, PTR Retinol Fusion PM and CeraVe lotion PM.

This moisturiser stinks of cheap sunscreen, not tangy and fresh at all. It goes on white and rubs in acceptably providing you don't use much, but I struggled to use the recommended amount - half teaspoon for face and neck - where I normally enjoy slathering creams on.

Within days I had two problems: my skin was less well hydrated and I felt this product was aggravating my rosacea - perhaps due to the chemical sunscreen agents or the fragrance. I switched to only using it on the perimeter of the face (as well as neck and decollete) and added one of my night oils into the routine. The two changes helped my skin return to 'normal'.

Ingredients wise the key actives are way down the ingredients list so I suspect Caudalie have only used a minimal percentage of pricey Tetra-C. It is completely pointless as a sunscreen if I cannot use it on the centre of my face, nor apply the recommended amount!

Overall I hated using this product and definitely will not repurchase nor recommend to anyone. I feel like I have reviewed a completely different product to the one Caroline Hirons recommends.

As a 25 year old design engineer currently looking for a job (I am self-employed with international clients at the moment, pays surprisingly well) the most common response was either:

1. You don't have enough experience (CV declares my age as '25 years' with 2 3/4 to 3 years experience in work)

2. You don't have the right skills (I have examples of 3D surfacing and FEM analysis printouts from previous workplaces)

Is this bullshit? 

If they had really thought about/paid enough attention to the information given on the CV I would consider it a lot less rude if they just did that straightaway without an interview.

It says so on the CV, why waste my time?

On a further note, the last salary I was on was £27k per year. I usually ask for £30k per year.

Anyone think this is too high? I am not sure.

One of my interviewers claimed that they had their most senior engineers on £32k and they expected at least 15 years experience for that level of pay.

Presumably the purpose of publishing everyone's personal tax details is to prevent tax evasion and reduce avoidance? If so, then I don't see how evasion can be addressed by this. Illegal activity is illegal, those who evade tax know they are doing so, and undeclared income remains undeclared. 

Tax avoidance, on the other hand is perfectly legal, and the big issue here is that the rich pay proportionally very little tax indeed compared to the little people, so how will this idea help with that?

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"Right, I think you have misunderstood me a bit. 

The examples I used were to illustrate a point: that one man's vision of 'happiness' is another's vision of 'misery'. 'Society #1' is currently just as unrealistic as the capitalist dream of everyone being motivated and buoyed by the ever-growing and ever-blossoming private sector. They are ideologies - something to strive for - not realities and the point I was making that one's definition of a successful society depends on one's ideology. I was making this point to illustrate that, in my world, 'high growth' does not necessarily equate 'high living standards' - a low-income family can be happier than a high income one, even thought he high-income one, in our world, obviously has better opportunities to be so. 

&gt; In fact, making the rich poorer usually only serves to make the poor poorer too. 

How so? Again, I have to point out Scandinavian countries that are constantly ranked as some of the world's most developed and that also have some of the highest tax rates in the world. 

I also think you might be slightly exaggerating my own arguments. Do I prefer to 'Society #1' to 'Society #2'? Yes. Do I want to *live* in 'Society #1' as opposed to some nebulous 'Society #3'? That depends on 'Society #3' - 'Society #1' is not necessarily my ideal, I just used it to make a point. 

But I do think that excessive social stratification is dangerous regardless of whether you are striving for a socialist or a capitalist or any other form of reasonably meritocratic society. And there are plenty of far more well-versed people than myself who have recently argued to this effect and have argued well. If one man has £60 and another £40, does it benefit them both to take £10 from one and give it to the other? Probably not. 

But there comes a point where there are too few with too much and too many with too little where it begins to hurt a society - however capitalist in its aims - for this inherently leads to the creation of monopolies and an oligarchy, which is unhealthy economically as it is unhealthy socially. You don't need a 'leftist' to tell you this - doesn't it make sense from a 'right wing' perspective as well? Isn't it good to maintain an equal playing field where anyone with enough talent and industry can topple another business, however big this business may be? It is this excessive stratification I am vastly opposed to and it is this I don't want us to go towards (and yes, I do fear we are). 

Now, I hope the above will address most of the wrongs you found with my previous answer, however, I would like to point out several things: 

* **The concept of the 'Eastern Bloc' as a complete unmitigated failure** - whilst in many cases it was, one cannot use a blanket approach. Yugoslavia is a good example of where the country was arguably doing better under Tito than the individual states did afterwards. In Czechoslovakia too, polls show that a significant proportion of the population believes their lives were better under the former regimes. In the Czech Republic, they have also voted to this effect in past elections. 
* **Mao's China** - China, all things considered, has done exceptionally well in turning a largely poor under-developed agrarian society into what it is today. And they did it in a manner of decades. Whatever the rights and wrongs of Mao, this was *a)* a hugely unusual situation where extreme ideology would lead to extreme results - on both ends of the spectrum - and *b)* would you say, considering the above, that Communism in China has failed? 
* **Venezuela** - as with China, taking Venezuela's starting point into account, I think it is difficult to judge the merits of the regime. But considering that they are being re-elected time after time, even now that Chavez is dead, I think I could argue that, generally speaking, the people are happy with their government.

**Good Example**

I currently earn around the market rate for this position and have 28 days holiday per year, options at a bonus which can go to 15% depending on performance of my current position and that is looking likely, I have the option of stocks after a period should I continue working at this company.

You would then need to start at a number which is something which is at the high end of the band and work from there, if you have impressed them in the interview this would not be difficult.  Does it piss all over internal candidates? Certainly, but then people should know that loyalty to a company should extend to what you are getting out of it - if you are offering more than you are getting you should look elsewhere, especially if you are in a field where there are a lot of positions open.

Seeing as I have been involved with NHS privatisation in the past rather intimately, I should stress that ideology is one thing and practice is another. 

Ideologically, a lot of people may agree with the level of privatisation you yourself agree with (and I don't necessarily oppose as vigorously as large-scale privatisation). But the problem is, currently, it is being handled atrociously, in my opinion, with only well-performing surgeries and services being taken over by private hands and leaving the under-performing problematic surgeries and services in NHS hands. This, to me, defies the point, as it is the troublesome financially-haemorrhaging bits that should need private hands the most to turn them into better services. 

This is the main reason why I oppose privatisation going further - the way it is going now, this will be the same massive failure as the IT system.

A 1.7% total increase, and Zero hour contracts make up only a small percentage on this 1.7%. So no in short Zero hour contracts are not pulling up the employment figures hugely.

The conclusion your taking from those numbers makes no sense. Theoretically all of that 27% could be on zero hours contracts, now obviously that isn't is the case, but without extra data you can't conclude that because zero hours contracts make up a minority of part time employment and that they have only recently become commonplace in low paid work that zero hours contracts only represent a small fraction of that 1.7% increase. Part-time work has a high turnover and as such most of the 2007 25.3% of the workforce would have left their 2007 job and the terms of contract available in the resulting opening may well have changed. In the interim employers offering part time work have found zero hours contracts to be more favourable to them for a variety of reasons and as such they have become more common. 

The important figure is what proportion of the 27% of the workforce currently in part time employment are on zero hours contracts? Without knowing that figure the claim that ""Zero hour contracts are not pulling up the employment figures hugely"" cannot be made. The 25.3% in part time work in 2007 is an irrelevant piece of historic data with in this regard and cannot be used to make the conclusion you present.",null,0,null,1423929358,null,0,false,0,colat87,null,t3_2vv71f,null,t1_colat87,null,t1_col99j2,null,null,null,1424584399,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

The assumption you make is that government has to subsidise low wages and companies can not afford to pay higher wages. Companies are sitting on record cash piles and making record profits and have also just received an 8% corporation tax cut, subsidies are not needed and if they are, the business is not viable or will need to adapt.  

A higher minimum wage could help lower the benefits bill, bring in more tax revenue and the savings could be spent on reskilling the people that lose jobs from business that can't adapt.

I think employment that is only available because it's cheaper than automation at the moment, is not good for the economy in the long run.

Serious. 

&gt; Well if you are not after a growth in economic activity you must be for huge tax rises or huge budget cuts.

I was arguing 'low-growth' versus 'high-growth'. I would prefer better-managed low growth to toxic high growth. I think we are currently experiencing toxic high growth, where little of our economic prosperity seems to 'trickle down' (I'm told it's supposed to). 

EDIT: I was also taking a swipe and those (and there are many) who believe 'Thy economy shall grow forever' and 'Commandment 11 supersedes the previous 10' as some sort of lost or unwritten commandments. I'm not saying you or OP belong to this camp, but there are those who should remember that the economy is there to serve the people and is there to build a healthy society - it is not a societal goal in of itself and the growth is allowed to stop one day, when the world is all right. 

&gt; What about if it creates inflexible labour markets and huge start up costs for small businesses?

And you think this is what Ed Milliband, the Greens or, indeed, any actual political party stands for? 

&gt; So no in short Zero hour contracts are not pulling up the employment figures hugely. 

I'll copy-paste my response from another answer: 

*""Re:zero-hour contracts, you are right, they are a small part of total jobs, but my gripe with them is because, in my opinion, they are used to inflate our current economic miracle. Since 2012, the number of people in employment on zero-hour contracts has risen from below 1% to 2%. Since 2003, the nature of zero-hour contracts has changed from a range of salaries to them being primarily used for lower-paid jobs.*

*So, in other words, there's more of them and the ones that are being created are likely of the 'problematic' kind. Since 2012, the government also reports unemployment dropping by some 0.7%, so I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that most of these new jobs are the 'problematic' zero-hour contracts.""*

I am not saying that most of our work-force is zero-hour contracts. I am saying that most of the jobs created by the Conservative government are. For this reason, I don't consider the current government's policies with regards to employment as successful and cannot therefore see how Labour would do worse. 

&gt; I wish it was short term but, A 1% surplus throughout the 2020s would reduce debt as a share of national income by 27 percentage points"" (IFS 2015). Thats 15 years down the line, and with promotion of economic growth, without it you can bet it would be worse.

What if the additional debt has a good ROI that, long-term, surpasses any surplus we may run now? I'm not sure how realistic a surplus of 1% for 15 years is anyway (that's not meant to be sarcastic - I genuinely don't know).

But even it was deeply flawed, and did well primarily because of colossal amounts of economic support from the USA, which saw Tito as a thorn in the Soviets' side.

The majority of voters for the Russian Communists, the German Linke Partei (the successor to the East German Communist Party) and numerous others are old.) as well as amongst some young people who always feel the grass is greener on the other side.  

Mao's China was a poor, backwards state in which millions died from starvation under the disaster that was a centrally planned economy, and from the numerous purges of the cultural revolution, which destroyed thousands of years of Chinese history and millions of priceless artefacts.  The country only began its journey out of the mire when Deng Xiaoping adopted capitalism (""to get rich is glorious"").  So yes, Communist China did fail.  Capitalist China has been an immense success.  

As for Venezuela, state propaganda has managed very well to present the right wing as a bunch of American fascists who want to kill all poor people, which has done wonders for their support in poorer parts of the country where information is more scarce.

Not sure what the answer is, personally I'd like to see them move to somewhere like London where there's plenty of jobs, making new non-dosser friends and they could break out of their downwards spiral. Don't think its the governments place to do that (and wouldn't work if the government tried) but if their relocation could magically be made reality I think it would be the best practical way to sort their lives out.

Anyone who knows anything about my opinions of West Ham will know I've been really quite vocal about how annoying it is when Nolan plays in spite of other players being better in the same position. I've probably gone a bit far with my criticism of him before, been a bit too rude and offensive to him, but this is just ridiculous. I know it's probably tongue in cheek, or meant to be taken as a bit of banter, but it's pretty disrespectful. 

Kev is very clearly a massively popular figure at West Ham. The players all love him, the manager (obviously) loves him. The truth is, he is past his best, and I'm sure he knows he's not the same player he was 3 years ago. But the things he's done for this club we should be thanking him. 

He dragged us up from the Championship with his boatload of goals (from midfield), and was a major part in keeping us up. We're now a very solid Premier League side. I know he's not playing the best football of his career, everyone knows that, but what he is doing, is keeping that dressing room in order, and leading that team. Last week against United, he played some decent through balls for Sakho and Valencia to run on to, but we all focus on the couple of instances of poor control he had. Fact is, he does work bloody hard, and he does put a shift in for the team, even if sometimes it's not as good as we should be expecting. 

I don't think he should necessarily be a starter every week, that's not the point of this post. The point is that we shouldn't be campaigning for him to be dropped or retire or leave the club. He's done a fucking lot for us. I'm not his biggest fan, but this whole thing makes me angry. ""Kevin Nolan retirement fund"". I don't know if this is a kneejerk reaction to today's result or not, but there was a lot of people at fault today, not just Kev. 4-0. That's not a scoreline caused by one persons inclusion in the team. That's a scoreline caused by 11 players who could not break down the other team. 11 players who could not create anything at all. We all know Pulis loves playing against us, and this is why. 

I'm just fucking rambling now. But whatever you take from this comment, please can we not turn into one of those clubs that has fucking campaigns every week? I just saw a video on twitter of people abusing Sullivan outside the ground after today's game. I mean really? Fuck off. Those people can fuck right off. 

We're having our best season in the past 10-15 years. Look at our squad. We have fucking Alex Song starting for us! Think back to where we were when we got relegated. If someone said to any of us, ""in a few years time, you'll be 8th in the league and battling for Europa, with Alex Song running the midfield, and you've just beaten City and Liverpool at home, *convincingly*, and we left the Boleyn feeling absolutely gutted that we lost to United"", every single one of us would be fucking taking that all day long. All of us. 

Let's get some fucking perspective. Let's not start shit with our team. Let's stay behind them. What help is it, starting a campaign for one of our most influential captains since... I dunno, a LONG, long time, and trying to ruin the spirit in the camp because of one result? 

Who remembers Matthew Upson? Anyone remember what a fucking horrific captain he was? Kevin Nolan has taken control of this team, along with Allardyce, and sorted us out, good and fucking proper. Last season I wanted Sam gone. We all know that, a lot of us did. But he has proved himself. Majorly proved himself. I want him to have another contract, and I want him to see just how high he can take us. 

I don't think Kev will play for much longer, maybe this will be his last season, who knows. But one thing I do know is, it's bloody disrespectful to want our captain gone. Imagine being him and seeing an actual campaign for him to retire. From his own fans. Tongue in cheek, yes, but people wouldn't start it if they didn't really have a small belief about it deep down. 

The boos when he gets taken off, or comes on as well. Pathetic. 

Fuck it, I don't even know what the point of my post was anymore but I'm just gonna leave it here anyway. Please can we not turn into dickheads? We're doing really fucking well. Like REALLY fucking well. We're West Ham, we don't challenge for Europe. Let's not get ahead of ourselves after we were fourth for about 3 weeks. Let's just enjoy it while it lasts. I don't want to have our club turn into some association for clueless, deluded bellends. Let's just see where this takes us, and actually enjoy being West Ham and enjoy how well this season has gone so far.

Assuming you don't have a magic wand that will make Lambert and Balotelli suddenly fit into Rodgers's way of playing, you seem to be saying you're OK with starting the season with just Sturridge and Origi.

Origi is young and coming from another country: he can't be expected to settle any faster than Markovic or Can, who I reckon are both ahead of any reasonable expectations. And he's not exactly prolific at his current club, is he?

That leaves Sturridge, who is awesome, but can not be expected to play every game in a season where we have European football.

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"&gt; Legacy support for a return to Communism is often found amongst the very old, who hate change everywhere (older people are always conservative, and rally against change, and in the eastern bloc one can see this easily. The majority of voters for the Russian Communists, the German Linke Partei (the successor to the East German Communist Party) and numerous others are old.) as well as amongst some young people who always feel the grass is greener on the other side.

Hmmm, this is a fairly common argument but one I'm not sure I buy entirely. 

Firstly, I don't get how older people being conservative affects this. The Czech Republic has been capitalist for 25 years now - the majority of the adult lives of most of the population. The age bracket of current 'old people' (50+) would start at 25+ in 1989. 25 is hardly 'old' by most measures, neither is 35 (current 60) or even 45 (current 70). The 'old people' of then are now mostly dead and for the 'current old people', the status quo is capitalism. Yet the KSCM (Czech communist party) poll higher than they did 1990 (15% now compared to 13% then) and have polled around this level for the past 25 years. 

So that means most of the rest of their current voters would belong to the 'grass is greener' sort, a remark I find highly patronising and dismissive of others. 

&gt; Mao's China was a poor, backwards state in which millions died from starvation under the disaster that was a centrally planned economy, and from the numerous purges of the cultural revolution, which destroyed thousands of years of Chinese history and millions of priceless artefacts. The country only began its journey out of the mire when Deng Xiaoping adopted capitalism (""to get rich is glorious""). So yes, Communist China did fail. Capitalist China has been an immense success.

We'll just have to disagree here as Mao, for all his highly idealistic and highly dangerous ideas, was instrumental in dismantling the social and industrial structure of the imperial era (a structure generally preserved in the 1919-1937 period) and in laying the foundations for the post-1976 'miracle'. 

I want to note that the actual death toll of Mao's policies will probably forever remain unknown. Early estimates came from reports from American agencies (hardly a reliable source for Chinese information) and the Chinese archives currently available to us provide only partial estimates (and are lower than the original numbers). However, I am not going to argue that the 'Great Leap Forward' wasn't a disaster that led to millions of deaths - it was and it did. 

I also want to note that health care indicators, such as life expectancy, infant mortality etc. in China, despite the 'Great Leap Forward' and the 'Cultural Revolution', were significantly higher at the end of Mao's reign than at the beginning. In other words, a lot of people died because of some of his policies. But, arguably, more survived because of others. 

I am no fan of Mao, but if you want to look at one side of his regime, you cannot ignore the other. 

As for post-1976 China, I would struggle to call it 'capitalism' in the Western sense. As with most things China, it is a very unique political system - it's neither Communism (I don't think any country can claim to have been truly 'Communist' - most I would call 'state capitalism') nor capitalism. Politically and socially, they use a lot of elements from Communism. Economically, I would call this an evolution of Soviet-era 'state capitalism' as opposed to capitalism in the Western sense. 

&gt; As for Venezuela, state propaganda has managed very well to present the right wing as a bunch of American fascists who want to kill all poor people, which has done wonders for their support in poorer parts of the country where information is more scarce. Still, despite this, protests are still frequent.

Hold on, this is a very dangerous thing to say - the propaganda has been immense from both sides. I don't see why you (or I) should believe one set of it and not the other. Most of the anti-government opposition in Venezuela has been educated in the US and have been funded by US interests. The whole anti-government movement wouldn't be where it is without significant funding from the USA. Regardless of where one stands, that is hardly a healthy state of affairs. 

This is why I am saying it is a tricky situation to judge. I just cannot safely say that one side is better than the other - both are likely to exaggerate the evils of the opposition and promote their own good deeds. I certainly can't gauge the pulse from behind a whole ocean. I can only go by who the Venezuelan population wish to live under and, thus far, it's been fairly one-sided. 

EDIT: I should also say that I'm quite enjoying the fact that we're both getting down-voted, despite our arguments being in opposition...   ;)

Sturridge is obviously one to keep.

Borini I'm sure we'd like to move on, but unless an offer comes in for something he wants (say a decent side in Serie A), he could well do the same as he did last summer.  Either way, we wouldn't get much for him.

Balotelli I think we would sell, but can't see anyone giving us much for him so he could well still be around next season.

Lambert will be in the last year of his contract and has no real value.

Aspas will be sold for peanuts to a Spanish team.

Origi is just coming in so obviously going nowhere.

Yesil we might release or sell for next to nothing.

So, for me, really depends on what happens with Borini, Balotelli, and Lambert.

&gt;""You did not. I rang your mobile but you did not answer. I sent a text you did not answer. When you promise something you carry it through.""

Jesus wept. What an arsehole.

I can understand you might send an email to say ""Hi, I think you said you'd give me a ring, but I haven't heard anything - did I miss your call"" *after a few days*. Maybe. 

Calling, texting and emailing the same day is some stalker-level neediness to begin with, and the deliberate insult of saying she's breaking her promise is just grade-A cuntishness there. No wonder she got pissed off with the cocky little shit. 

OK it's a pity she sent the wrong email,but I'm not in the least surprised she wanted to vent. On the other hand maybe it'll teach him the difference between an actual promise and a generic post-interview platitude in future.

Disagree wholeheartedly, if anything having the drive to go out on your own is a huge plus point. Just be sure not to under-charge clients, it give a perception of your work being less valuable/skillful which can go against you in the long run. 

&gt; it's the politics that is difficult for me mostly.

Then being a contractor is a good option for you. I work as an IT contractor and get gigs working from home and working in client offices. I do not need to attend all of the ""company announcements"" and all of that crap. Holiday bonus drama is not relevant as the base pay is better than being salaried.

null,false,Calchitcho,null,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, I don't get how older people being conservative affects this. The Czech Republic has been capitalist for 25 years now - the majority of the adult lives of most of the population. The age bracket of current 'old people' (50+) would start at 25+ in 1989. 25 is hardly 'old' by most measures, neither is 35 (current 60) or even 45 (current 70). The 'old people' of then are now mostly dead and for the 'current old people', the status quo is capitalism. Yet the KSCM (Czech communist party) poll higher than they did 1990 (15% now compared to 13% then) and have polled around this level for the past 25 years. 

Well, the entire discussion revolves around mostly anecdotal evidence, but I read the German electoral commission's report for the most recent electoral cycle and it confirmed that polling for Die Linke was massively disproportionate for people aged 45-60 in the former East German states.  This is a demographic that came of age in East Germany at the fall of the wall (and thus ironically was out protesting), but now clearly feels rather nostalgic for the old Socialist Unity Party and its policies.  All this evidence might be circumstantial, but it lines up with the assertion that people who have childhood memories of the Eastern Bloc might have a slightly warped perception of the reality.  

&gt;We'll just have to disagree here as Mao, for all his highly idealistic and highly dangerous ideas, was instrumental in dismantling the social and industrial structure of the imperial era (a structure generally preserved in the 1919-1937 period) and in laying the foundations for the post-1976 'miracle'. 

One of the great tragedies of Chinese historical study is that the period 1911-1948 is so rarely understood, with the exception of the Second World War and perhaps also the Manchurian Crisis.   In reality, Chinese society changed hugely over the period.  Very few of the Qing Dynasty structures that had existed at the dawn of the 20th century existed by the end of the (mainland) reign of Chiang Kaishek. 

It is impossible to say whether the foundation of a more stable social structure that *did* precede China's transformation from 1976 would not have happened without Mao.  Kaishek's China was one of warlords and gangs and rival political factions vying for control, but it was also a China wracked by foreign intervention, by the West, the nascent Soviet Union, and Japan. 

Had the Kuomintang remained in control long after the Allied victory, and had he not faced a massive Communist insurgency, it is certainly possible that China would have industrialised and stabilised without Mao.  The rapid industrialisation of Formosa/Taiwan into one of the most prosperous and developed states in Asia (albeit with American assistance) certainly does not discredit this as a possibility.  

Post 1976 China has not practised what might be termed Western Liberal-Democratic Capitalism, but it certainly has had a form of capitalism, which might be defined loosely as private ownership of the means of production combined with a market economy.  China has both of these despite some nationalised industries, and the government is tolerant of (and indeed promotes) the accumulation of private wealth and private property.   Numerous private firms compete in the marketplace.   It is certainly not a continuation of Soviet Communism, under which there was no such thing as private property, the state employed everyone, and wealth was discouraged.   Inequality in China is also higher than in the West, and tax rates are indeed lower.  

Venezuela is an interesting situation.  The exact legitimacy of its democracy has been questioned many times, and observers have come to many different conclusions ranging from that it's a corrupt, one-party state to the idea that it's a paragon of democracy that should serve as an example to the rest of the world.  What can't be argued, however, is that the rule of the Chavistas has had considerable effects on the economy that many would traditionally see as negative.   The fact that some of the often uneducated and rural poor continue to support Maduro to an extent large enough to secure his continued rule, arguably backed by a not insignificant amount of xenophobia against foreigners which government-backed conspiracy theories rile up, does not diminish the existence of these economic realities.

They advertised the position on our university careers website. Unfortunately, my phone stopped working and I sent them a polite email letting them know that I wouldn't be reachable for a day or two while I got it fixed. I got a snarky response about how my ""inability to make contact by telephone in the 21st century"" contradicted the skills and experience mentioned in my cover letter.

Not one to take this lying down, I sent one back:

&gt; The issue with my contact number is actually due to the fault of my phone company, who are compensating me for the error but unfortunately I am having to wait for my service to be reactivated. I regret that I am not contactable any other way, but I do not believe that I should be addressed with such abrasive disrespect for something that is outside my own control. 

&gt; I hope that your deeply unprofessional and highly rude email does not reflect the manner with which you treat your employees and clients. I shall be bringing this email to the attention of our Careers Department in order to have your vacancy removed from the database.

&gt; It may be the 21st century, but it is still important to remember your manners.

The careers department profusely apologised and blacklisted his business.

Bullet dodged, I think. I don't believe it would have been pleasant working for someone like that.

I had no problem finding a job, either - and now probably make more money than this guy does. His company has changed names several times and his profile is riddled with typos.

EDIT: I should add that I am now on the other end of the exchange and have to reject people for jobs frequently.

null,false,Rapscallian,null,null,null,"It's hard to blame tonight's performance on just Nolan. There's honestly no excuse for how the ENTIRE team played today.

Adrian let that shot in at his near post some-fucking-how. No PL keeper should be beaten at the neat post like that, this isn't fucking fifa15.

Kouyate and Tomkins were very close to useless today. Constantly letting their markers get away from them and being extremely slow closing down.

Jenkinson and Cresswell didn't really fulfill their attacking or defensive duties today. Pretty much allowed he wba bunch to walk all over them. Remember when they used to get superb crosses in the entire 90 minutes? Every cross today was absolutely shit.

Not only Nolan, but Noble as well had very little effect on the game at all, disappearing for a large majority of the game. To add to that Noble, who we usually look at as our playmaker had absolutely no dangerous passes at all - constantly passing backwards.

Song arguably had a decent game, but again, like Noble his passing was piss poor. For being one of the best and most experienced player on the team he certainly didn't lead by example.

Downing, again, did very little. Sure you could argue this being due to Nolan's positioning forces him out wide but regardless he's still got a duty to perform, and he failed to do that.

Valencia seemed to be really selfish today, as he does sometimes previously. He always attempts to go it alone rather than to work as a pair with his striking partner which just leads to him losing possession and a chance to score.

Sakho is hard to criticise since he had very little support and assistance today and got our best (really only) chance of the game. However, he did still feel lazy at times and didn't seem to really try and get involved in the game.

Basically what I'm saying is that the entire team is at fault today.

Oh yeah and Fat Sam bringing on O'Brien and Cole on for Song and Sakho probably wasn't the best move if you want to outtactic your opponent.",null,0,null,1423937332,null,0,false,0,coled9r,null,t3_2vvje9,null,t1_coled9r,null,t3_2vvje9,null,null,null,1424586081,null,4,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,4,null

I think the facts that a lot of people have been getting on his back, coupled with the fact that we have not been competitive for most of the season are the two main reasons why he is leaving... I also think that for him and his young family it is a great opportunity to live somewhere other than Liverpool (I'm a scouser btw)... Can't blame the manager for that...

MCB have some [interesting views, e.g.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain)

&gt;MCB guidance for schools says that parents of Muslim children should be allowed to withdraw their children from school activities involving mixed swimming, dance, sex and relationship education, music, drama, and figurative drawing on religious grounds. On farm visits, touching or feeding pigs should be prohibited. It also warns that pupils and parents may refuse to shake hands with the opposite sex during prize-giving ceremonies.

Edit:  [And MCB's comments on Charlie Hebdo](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/14/charlie-hebdo-muslim-leaders-appeal-calm) shows their mistrust of free-speech:

&gt;In a 10-point advice sheet issued by the Muslim Council of Britain, which was signed by more than 50 Muslim leaders, the imams said “freedom of speech should not be translated into a duty to offend”, and they urged Muslims to express their “justified displeasure at the mockery that is made of our faith” in a peaceful manner.

One piece of very important advice: I strongly recommend paying for some or all of this this engagement ring by credit card.

This means that if you try to take the ring back, and the shop denies any wrong doing you can send the ring to the credit card company for a full refund and its up to them to try and deal with the fraud.

**71'-** Liverpool have taken a little of the sting out of the game, but only by faffing around at a couple of throw-ins. They’re not displaying much in the way of midfield control right now.

**72'-** Bolasie nearly squirms free down the right, but is eventually crowded out of it by a combination of Sakho and Can. It’s Bolasie’s last contribution to the match, as he’s replaced by Zaha.

**74'-** Campbell overpowers Can down the left, by the corner flag. Can very sleepy there. Campbell breaks into the area, near the byline. He’s got Zaha in the middle, but the cross is abysmal, rolled straight into the hands of Mignolet at the near post.

**75'-** A dismal couple of minutes for Can concludes with a booking, as he tugs back Guedioura in the midfield.

**76'-** Zaha forces a corner off Sakho down the right. It’s hit deep, and caught cleanly by Mignolet.

**77'-** Liverpool have hardly put two passes together since taking the lead. This is as poor as their turnaround in the early portion of this half was impressive.

**78'-** With that in mind, Brendan Rodgers makes a double change. Lambert and Lovren come on, Sturridge and an extremely quiet Coutinho make way.

**80'-** Can slips Henderson away down the right. Henderson reaches the byline, then dinks one into the middle. Lambert was preparing to meet the cross, but slipped. Palace were light at the back there, and breathe again.

**83'-** A bit of possession for Liverpool. Lallana has it by the left-hand corner flag. Soon enough, the ball’s back with Mignolet. Then back up the left through Moreno. Liverpool keep it for the best part of two minutes. The inevitable ole! Ole! Palace finally nick it. Their supporters, after one pass, start with the ole!s themselves. That’s some pretty good terrace back-and-forth, there.

**84'-** Lambert sends Can into space down the right. For a second the home side are backpedalling in panic, but Can can’t deliver to Balotelli in the middle.

**85'-** Henderson picks Ledley’s pocket, on the edge of the Palace box, to the right of the D. He sashays towards the byline, and pulls across for Balotelli, with a view to the Italian tapping in. But the cross isn’t great, behind Balotelli, and hacked clear by a relieved Dann.

**87'-** Liverpool have done marvellously well to draw the sting from this game since the double change, because Palace were well on top. Now the home side can’t get out of their own half. Palace need to do something quickly. Of course, they have quite a bit of form in the respect of late comebacks.

**89'-** Ward strides in the big-leggy style down the inside-right channel. It’s a determined run, and a decent cross follows, a ball curled at pace towards the far post. But Campbell can’t contort his body to meet the pass, which was just behind him.

**90'-** Lovren sprays a spectacular pass down the right for Balotelli, who pulls the ball across the face of the Palace box for Lambert. The striker shoots, but his effort is deflected out for a corner on the right. There will be five minutes of added time. Sounds about right, given all the subs, and the injury to Sakho.

**90' +1-** Ward, down the right, sprays a long crossfield ball towards Zaha, just in front and to the left of the Liverpool area. Can is all over Zaha, and concedes a clumsy free kick. Gayle steps up ...

**90' +2-** ... and attempts a curler into the top right. He gets the ball up, but it’s not coming back down any time soon. Way over the bar. Mignolet prepares to take the resulting goal kick, and fannies around with purpose. He’s booked for his trouble.

**90' +3-** Ward and Balotelli get involved in a little shoving match over a throw. Nothing much in it, and once again Balotelli wanders away smiling.

**90' +4-** Balotelli, taking a pass up the left wing, channels the spirit of Didi Hamann, holding the ball up and drawing a time-wasting foul.

**90' +5-** Skrtel bangs into the back of Gayle, under a high ball, 25 yards out, to the left of the Liverpool box. What a daft challenge.

**90' +6-** But Lambert heads clear, and that’s that! A magnificent second-half performance by Liverpool, who turned things around in its early period, then put a stop to Palace’s gallop with a controlled performance towards the end.

What an absolute shit performance. Nobody looked good. Cresswell, who's usually solid even when the team is shit, even he looked shit. Kouyate looked okay, but that's about it. When Nolan has a good performance, I keep hoping it means he is going to start playing better consistently. But no, he was his usual sack of shit, lazy self again. We didn't put a single decent shot on frame all match. We were outplayed from the manager on down. It was a terrible way to go out of the FA Cup and certainly doesn't inspire any confidence for the next few league matches in the midst of our most difficult stretch of the season.

And just to make it that much fucking worse, BFS says in his post-match interview that we ""had this loss coming."" We had a disgraceful, 4-0, could have been 8-0 loss coming?! FUCK YOU, SAM.

Here's some information about the original question:

&gt;But the biggest and clearest misrepresentation is the claim that ""one third of British Muslims students say it's acceptable to kill for Islam."" This is such a blatant distortion that it's hard to explain how journalists could twist the results of the poll in such a perverse way by accident. The actual question asked was:

 &gt;   ""Is it ever justifiable to kill in the name of religion?""

&gt;    Yes, in order to preserve and promote that religion - 4%

&gt;    Yes, but only if that religion is under attack - 28%

&gt;32% said that it was acceptable to kill in the name of a religion - not Islam, any religion. Of those, 87.5% said ""only in self-defense"", while the tiny remainder said yes to an answer that includes the confusing conflation ""preserve and promote"". 

That's from the Guardians article about the Daily Mail reprinting the same story in 2010, it also mentions some of the other ""statistics"" that you quoted - worth a read.

That is what he said. Romanian people. He might not have said ""all of those Romanians are pikie criminal scum"" but he did say he would not like to live next door to any Romanian people.

Yeah, all of your posts are entirely devoid of logic. 

So what if they contain warnings or information about the health consequences, you can find all of that online about drugs. More to the point though, so fucking what? People still consume those things and *you* are paying for them, something that you're apparently not okay with. 

Since we're talking about money. Do you ever think about how much the war on drugs costs? How much money the police takes up trying to hunt down drug users in the first place (which, by the way, doesn't work at all). Then if drugs were actually legal you could tax those anyway so you don't exactly have an argument there. You seem pretty confused anyway since you say regulation would be a good idea.

BUT, the only really important thing is that people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. If I want to jump off a building and break both of my legs I can do that and the NHS will care for me, and you'll be paying the bill with your taxes. The point of the NHS isn't that you get back what you put in, it's that free healthcare exists for everyone regardless of who that person is or what they've done. That is the very essence of the NHS. 

You have no right to police other peoples' bodies. Either you want free healthcare for everyone or you're straight up against the principle of the NHS.

null,false,_Brutal_Jerk_Off_,null,null,null,"&gt;That is what he said. Romanian people. He might not have said ""all of those Romanians are pikie criminal scum"" but he did say he would not like to live next door to any Romanian people.

See, the statement says ""Romanian people"" but this is in reference to the question he was asked, which was :

&gt;""I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next to you, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be.""


And part of the statement in question:

&gt;""But it is to say that any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door. So far as I can see most of those media commentators objecting to this statement are people living in million pound houses for whom the prospect of such a turn of events is not a real one.



So, in reference to this, **very specific** question, they used one word as a synonym, in context,  for the phrase ""group of Romanian men"". Also, note that they say :

&gt;""if we were able to operate a proper work permit scheme for Romanian nationals, with suitable checks, as recommended by UKIP, then nobody would need to be concerned if a group of Romanian nationals moved in next door to them. ""

So, they are suggesting that the inadequate immigration controls allow people with serious criminal records into the country, which because of the crime rates and a few of the roma people, causes problems. If immigration was stricter on people that committed certain and various crimes, it is suggested by UKIP that this will be much less of an increasing issue.



&gt;If he had of said ""Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Black people suddenly moved in next door."" I doubt even kippers would be defending him, even though it's the same thing.


It highly depends on the background of those people. Say, for example, it was a group of 5 black men, just off of the boat from Nigeria, where their culture is much different and generally have huge differences between Western countries. If they moved into a 2 bedroom house in London, is that fair to be concerned?
It would mean, a group of men (regardless of the colour of their skin) are living inadequately, which could make people concerned due to the possibility of criminal activities, or payment below that of the minimum wage, again possibly leading to criminal activity. You have to look at this carefully, since this doesn't paint any group of people as ""all the same criminal scum""  but a very select few in a certain area. 


&gt;Also considering Farage thinks that anti-English racism is a thing[2] he is, by his own definition, an anti-Romanian racist.

We have Winks and Onomah both coming up too. And of course Alli coming next season. Windy always rated Luongo VERY VERY highly...not surprised that this is happening. 

If we lose Capoue and Paulinho and even Stambouli then it becomes an interesting question. Do we need to buy a more experienced player? Do we feel comfortable with Mason, Bentaleb, Alli, and Dembele with Carroll possibly coming back and Winks and Onomah coming soon? 

I guess it's the definition of a good problem to have. We have by my count five academy-produced central midfielders who are either already in our first team or on the fringes of it. Add Luongo and it's six.

I think it's inevitable that some of them end up leaving, but we should absolutely continue to insert buy back clauses or first option clauses in any deal we do for them.

Mignolet, like I've mentioned before, if you tell him to do what he is best at, he's a great keeper. Tell him to become a sweeper keeper, and he can't do that but tell him to do the basics of goal keeping and he's very good.

**Price of product:** ~60p for two 1ml samples

Stabilized Vitamin C plus potent antioxidants in a silky base join ingredients that repair damaged cells and rebuild skin's protective barrier so it functions optimally. This state-of-the-art serum efficiently addresses multiple issues that cause skin to look wrinkled while reducing inflammation and the visible effects of sun damage.

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as part of the PC Resist sample pack.

**Your opinion:** A great looking formula, wall-to-wall actives aside from the silicone base - I can see why this is a bestseller for Paula's Choice.

This serum has a similar pleasant thick silky texture to the PC Skin Recovery serum with retinol [reviewed here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2jorf0/the_vitamin_a_reviews_aka_retinoids/cldou8m) It is a shame PC don't reveal the percentage of vitamin C as they do with retinol, the full size is too expensive to recommend without that.

The point is that they are available very clearly at the point of purchase and consumption.

Tell me, where can I go online and find out how much MDMA (if any) is in the pills being sold at one of the nightclubs in town?

Will it be the same as any other nightclub anywhere else, will that information be online too?

&gt; More to the point though, so fucking what?

You don't think that there is a safety issue when people don't actually know how much of a health-impacting substance they are consuming?

&gt; People still consume those things and you are paying for them

People pay tax and excise duty on other drugs.

&gt; Do you ever think about how much the war on drugs costs?

Yes, I think of the social costs too and the fact that the money ultimately goes back up the chain and into organised crime.

I live in an area blighted by heroin addiction and I understand well enough the connection between heroin, the global drugs trade, poppy farmers and international terrorism, human trafficking and money laundering.

&gt; You seem pretty confused anyway since you say regulation would be a good idea.

It *would* be a good idea, as that way people will get a consistent product that is as safe as can be and we eliminate the majority of the criminal aspect from drugs.

I don't need to like drugs, but I'm not blind enough to pretend that hard reduction is preferable to our current strategy.

&gt; The point of the NHS isn't that you get back what you put in, it's that free healthcare exists for everyone regardless of who that person is or what they've done. 

The point of the NHS is that it is NOT free.

Hospitals don't build themselves, the drugs aren't donated by the benevolence of pharmaceutical companies and the staff don't just turn up because they have nothing better to do with their time each day.

The NHS might well be free at the point of use but that's a very different concept to being ""free""; there is a monetary cost associated with everything and resources are limited. I'd much rather the NHS spent money treating people who are ill through no fault of their own rather than people who are there because of their own stupidity or their poor lifestyle choices, but that's not something that I can change.

&gt; You have no right to police other peoples' bodies.

It's a nice soundbite, but it's just a real pity for you that I'm not actually trying to do that.

Sorry.

&gt; Either you want free healthcare for everyone or you're straight up against the principle of the NHS.

Oh right, that's a nice Bushism -  I'm either with you or I'm with the terrorists right?

Gosh, *how on earth* do other places in Europe manage to provide healthcare that's free at the point of use without an NHS?

&gt; To be honest though, I just get the impression that you haven't really thought it through very hard.

And nobody is saying it's a case of 'eat more salad'. It is, however, a case of 'eat less everything'.

Calories in vs calories out. The only reason anybody is ever overweight is because they have taken in more calories than they've expended. The only way anyone ever loses weight is because they've expended more calories than they've taken in.

Sure, there are conditions which make it _more difficult_, but nobody said losing weight is easy. It is _always_ possible, however.

If you want to lose weight, I'll point you in the direction of /r/keto, and their [Keto in a Nutshell](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZfJejOM8fJsX1iCilmnpp1qmT_KncJwWCR4-EsaEHc/edit?pli=1) document. The Keto diet is a way of effectively reducing your calorie intake and forcing your body to use its fat reserves whilst simultaneously still providing the nutrients you need to live.

The diet will make you feel like absolute crap for a few days whilst your body adapts to using your stored fat as it's primary fuel source, but once that's happened you should see some pretty decent weight loss pretty quickly.

Losing weight is hard, but not impossible. Good luck!

null,false,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,null,"I've watched a few games of his, and I know a few guys who have seen more still. 

Gorre has a good finish on him, and a decent amount of pace. He's been making short work of a lot of defences he has faced.

Here's the problem though, and you've touched upon it: he hasn't faced a senior defence yet. The modern centre half is a lot quicker than they used to be, so his pace which *isn't* remarkably high will not serve him as well. He's been getting in the right positions in matches, but against players with drastically more experience and less naivety, he might not get this either. I would also say the standard of goalkeeping is drastically poorer at youth level, more so than any other position. I'm no expert here, but that's my opinion based on what I've seen. 

Having watched for a while, those friends of mine said that Barrow was a level above the games he was playing in, hence him breaking into the senior side - but it's not the case that he's currently one of our best players, just a guy with the potential to go far. Gorre is scoring and scoring plenty, but he is not (and this my opinion now) 'above' the level he is playing at, but rather playing it it very well.

The reality is that a lot of players can tear up youth level and collapse at senior level, often because they are physically early developers and less technically gifted, and once their peers catch up in physical development and gain playing experience they can really kick on and become good (Leon Britton being an excellent example over a long period, while I've read from Tim Sherwood that playing Carroll in his youth sides was detrimental to the results because he couldn't compete, but he persisted with him because he believed that what I'm saying now is often the case). I'm not saying this is why Kenji will fail, but it's why I'm saying to keep expectations tempered. 

Furthermore, we play a single striker system - if he can't handle the step up, he will crazy and burn hard because nobody can bail him out and cover his deficiencies (think how Barrow has a fullback overlapping him, while Fulton has a holding partner alongside him if he gets caught out). It's an incredible amount of pressure and responsibility in his position. 

Does this sound negative? I'll finish up by adding this: Gomis is playing ineffectively, and unlike youth graduates (although calling Gorre our product is disingenuous), I now have no vested interests in seeing him succeed due to his personality. On that note, I'd say get ourselves to about 42 points and then get Gorre on the bench and hopefully get some minutes - give him the senior experience but don't put pressure on him to succeed. Our season is close to being a dead rubber, so I'd love to use it productively instead of grinding points against fellow mid table sides for the sake of final positioning.

That being said, while he has scored less goals, I might prefer us to go with Alex Samuel. The *type* of striker he is seems more conductive to our style, and he's Welsh; God only knows how desperate the national side is for competent Welsh forwards. This isn't a concern to many here, but it is to me and I personally believe should he to the club. He's also a childhood fan of the club and I somewhat naively think that's worth something. I also think he's younger by a year or two so that gap in talent might be irrelevant.

He lambasts him for not understanding the role Allen is playing and not seeing what Allen actually offers; ring any bells? I really think the issue is people don't understand his role in the side properly.

Allen is there to provide a reliable pivot moving forward and is expected and instructed specifically not to take unnecessary risks in attempting long piercing balls (Gerrard) or bombing forward to join the attack (Hendo) but instead to recycle possession in order to facilitate other more creative members of the side. I hear all the time people asking why would we have someone in the side merely to facilitate, and whilst that is already massively unfair to Allen since he does offer much more, it is absolutely vital to our style of play. He is an excellent presser. He does the simple things marvellously well (easy said than done, just look at Gerrard and Henderson when they are asked to play the Allen/Lucas role). He is very intelligent footballer who reads the game well and has very good technique, movement, pace (for his position) and agility. He wins the balls back more times than most realize through reading the play and intercepting or literally poking the ball away from a opposition player (hard to describe, but if you've seen it you'll appreciate it - there aren't many i've seen who do this quite as effectively as Allen) but his defensive contribution is often judged purely on specific short-comings like his vulnerability when an opposition player is allowed a free run at him or in a physical battle.

I think he's a great player in the right system. Yes, he has short-comings, but so do many. I'm sure I'll be mauled for saying this but I actually prefer him to Lucas in this role.

From what you're saying maybe we should loan Gorre to a championship side? I think he's a star in the U-21 league, but dealing with the speed and strength of the championship will show us his true colors. 

Your point about the 'lone' striker, rather than supported wing or midfield is spot on. Just to expand on this, I think it is why Gomis' awful form affects us so much.

Samuel scored a hell of a goal and I'd love to seem him pan out as well. I guess Gorre is just more exciting to watch, but Samuel very well could be the stronger of the two technically.

He pointed out that due to the dynamic between the doctor and companion having a female doctor and a male companion could actually make the show seem MORE sexist, not less. At least in recent years, theres been a very clear pattern of having a flawed, troubled often goofy male doctor with a strong, stable female to support him, keep him in line, and keep him from falling apart. If the roles were switched you're in danger of ending up with a stereotypical weak female/strong male support situation where a flawed, troubled and goofy woman would keep turning to a strong stable male companion for guidance. This could inadvertantly have the opposite effect of what they were going for.

It COULD work, however, if they had a female doctor AND a female companion. If they are willing to have a completely woman-led show, without any male leads they might be able to pull it off. But thats an even bigger decision than changing the doctor.

It was some seriously bad tactics and formations we were playing with, culminating with that starting XI against Basel. We were at the bottom of pretty much every stats table in the league both defensively and going forward. 

After the Basel game we changed everything about the style and formation of the team, this wasn't something gradually building up and then it finally clicked, this was Rodgers doing a U-turn. We changed playstyle (not keeping possession at our own half, more direct attacking, more creativity and pace in the starting XIs, new formation with 3 at the back etc). 

I think this change was a relatively desperate move seeing as it was so drastic, and he was under a lot of pressure after failing to qualify from an ""easy"" CL-group and a bunch of bad results in the league making us a mid-table team at the time.

Exactly.  People harp on about BT, but it's actually *Openreach* that do the fibre laying and network expansion and this Openreach network is open to all third-party ISPs - including BT Consumer - and communications providers.  BT get government subsidies to do this work, Openreach get paid for doing the work and providing connectivity on behalf of third-parties (e.g. TalkTalk will pay Openreach to go to Mrs. Miggins' house and wire up her phone), Wholesale also get paid for providing backhaul to smaller ISPs.

Virgin's network is available to... well... Virgin customers.  In some areas they are providing phone and ADSL broadband services over Openreach and BT Wholesale.

One interesting area where the evidence seems to contradict perceived wisdom:

&gt;None of the countries with a high degree of stratification, whether in the form of tracking, streaming, or grade repetition is among the top performing education systems or among the systems with the highest share of top performers.

And one nitpick with the conclusions: Andreas Schleicher should be comparing percent GDP and not US$.  $53,000 may well buy more quality teaching time in the Slovak Republic than $115,000 does in the US. 

&gt;For example, students in the Slovak Republic, which spends around $53,000 (£35,000) per student between the age of 6 and 15, perform on average at the same level at age 15 as the United States which spends over $115,000 (£76,000) per student.

null,false,rmsb,Trinity,Trinity,null,"Look up what different colleges say - some might insist on the A2, although not all do, and all will wonder why you haven't taken it if your school offers it. I think the accepting just AS is meant for cases where schools are just unequipped to teach it - if a school cannot teach it at all, there are reasonable ways and resources to get the AS, but it is harder for the A2.

I'm assuming you'll only have done AS maths by the end of this year if you've not been taking further - a fair number of people will apply having done all of A level maths in year 12 and all of A level further maths in year 13, so it's not weird to have not started any of the material in further by the end of your AS year, but it might be strange if you've not done the A2 maths material either. But if you can do all of further maths in a year, it's not going to be a deal breaker. That said, if you're concerned, have you thought about teaching yourself some of the easier modules?

The STEP grade will be a big part of your offer - in the sense that, for almost everybody, it's the bit you are most likely to miss and that will require most work. It's also somewhat closer than A level is to the style of maths/way you need to think of maths at university - proof and thought required rather than regurgitating steps with the numbers you are given. And, in some sense, colleges will care more about how you do in STEP than about A levels. If you do get an offer, though, it will almost always be the standard offer (A*AA and I, I or I, II depending on college in STEP II and III when I applied). 

For making a decision: Make sure you're considering what subjects will be like at university level, not what they are like in school - sciences, and maths in particular, change somewhat. For example, maths will become a lot more abstract and concerned with proof, although less so if you later focus on applied maths rather than pure. Something else to note is that, with a bit of work, it can be possible to switch Tripos from Maths to (the physical side of) Natural Sciences, but Maths is extremely unlikely to accept people the other way round - although this should not be a reason to go for Maths rather than Nat Sci if you are unsure.

UKIP's policies are a bit further away from that, UKIP has no desire to sell the NHS, they have discussed it in the past and the party as a whole wishes to keep the NHS free for all, [as stated on their policies page:](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people)

– UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all UK residents.

– We will stop further use of PFI in the NHS and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where this is affordable.

– UKIP opposes the sale of NHS data to third parties.

&gt;And they bang on about immigrants because they no lesser educated minds will blindly follow them based on that one misguided peice of information.

I can't deny that stating they wish to limit immigration is what has caused the party to grow so much, they have put plenty of good points forward as to the problems with unlimited immigration and what they generally wish for is to have some control over our borders. I'm not personally as bothered with the immigration point as I am with the European Union in general but there is a lot of people who are concerned. 

&gt;The irritating thing is there isn't even an immigration problem!! 

So are you saying that an increasing amount of immigration and population in our country isn't going to cause stress on our public services and such? Would it not be better if we could pick and choose those which are going to benefit our country rather than letting everybody come in despite having criminal records and such.

&gt;That's just what the Tory owned press blinds us with so we don't look at the real problem. Which is massive multi billion pound companies not paying their tax bills and instead paying back handers to Mr Cameron and the bullingdon club boys. 

There can be more than one problem in the country, there is a problem with multi billion pound companies not paying taxes but that problem isn't limited to the Tories, Labour haven't done anything about it either.

&gt;Ukip are a terrifying prospect and yes the people voting for then are doing so out of stupidity, ignorance and a general lack of understanding. 

So would you say that all UKIP voters and stupid?

&gt;Oh and yes they are the far right. That term is not only reserved for Nazi style racist regimes. 

So what about them makes them far right?

What's really impressive is she manages to capture the slightly-off way one of the clones would appear when attempting to *impersonate* another - essentially acting like she's acting like someone who is acting like another person, enough that you can see both the character and the character's subtle differences at the same time.  The camerawork is also extremely impressive for a TV show - lots of well-framed and well-composed shots, and it gets especially interesting when she acts opposite herself in a single shot.

That's definitely a false dichotomy. People not hating gay people is not proof of there not more work to be done. Nor is it proof that making gay jokes does not continue negative notions.

It's not whether the Doctor is female or whether the Doctor is another ethnicity or tall or short or fat or skinny, it's whether you watch him/her on screen and instantly your brain says ""this is an ancient Time Lord from another world"".  That's the secret.  It's absolutely vital to the success of the show that the role of the Doctor holds verisimilitude.  Without it, it could be a shark jumping moment.  I'm convinced that along with a slash in budget and weirdly scatterbrained writing, it was the costuming and attitudes of Six and Seven that started pushing people away from the show, which eventually led to the first cancellation.  Sylvester McCoy, I love, but his Doctor's personality clashed with his costume.  Same with Colin Baker.  They both did good jobs as actors trying to put both seriousness and humor into their roles, but they were dressed like clowns.  Note how RTD handled the Ninth Doctor in the new series.  No nonsense, no bright colors.  Black leather over dark purple, green.  It felt dangerous, and Eccleston played it like he was dangerous.  That was a big deal.  An ancient alien who controls the most powerful ship in the universe and can twist the laws of time to his will has to be a serious person, not a clown.

Notice how Matt Smith handled his version of the Doctor.  After first regenerating, he played it as light and silly with a silly bow tie and yet, the patches on his elbows screamed authority figure.  Time passed, the seasons went on and Eleven grew up, both in wardrobe and in attitude.  

You have to cast someone who, even in still photos IS the Doctor.

&gt;Um... no? I'm not even offended? Bigotry is just bad and trying to get rid of it is a positive thing. 

You're just getting offended on others behalf, which is almost worse. 


&gt;&gt; How many people 30 and under do you know that hate gay people specifically because they're gay?

&gt;That's definitely a false dichotomy. People not hating gay people is not proof of there not more work to be done. Nor is it proof that making gay jokes does not continue negative notions. It's not all about explicit ""hate;"" it's more about implicit notions that continue negativity and enforced roles. 


It's not a false dichotomy. Making gay jokes is just that, jokes. If a gay person asks me to stop in their presence, I will. If somebody who gets offended on gay people's behalf asks me to stop, I'll tell em to fuck off. 


&gt;&gt; I also don't see why people get up in arms about it [gay slurs as insults]. 

&gt;You are extremely naive if you don't see how gay slurs aren't negative in terms of cultural treatment. The acceptability of slurs as insults is what leads to more and more intolerance. Which quite obviously makes it more difficult for them being accepted.

Wings:  aguero out on the right and Nasri on the left.  Both would come back and offer lots of options to pass to, neither pressing the backline constantly.  Nasri coming back more so than aguero.   I feel like aguero would be a menace on the wing though for this game.  

Forward:  Bony.  He is a brick wall.  He would be challenging the back line constantly.

There have been numerous observations that the pride that Algerians feel for Algeria, even second, third, or fourth generation individuals who have not stepped foot in the country still fel that same pride. 

This is only made more evident by the inherent racism in France. When Benzema does well, he is ""French."" But the moment that some people choose to critique him, he is an ""Arab"". Nasri and him both are completely fed up by this dual standard. As I live in the USA, if Jermaine Jones had a bad game, NOONE would ever even think about calling him ""That German"" or ""that half-german"". 

While perhaps many people who are pejorative, uninformed, or choose to remain ignorant would say that our current crop of players only represented Algeria as a second choice, one only has to look at the numerous interviews given before they were even in national team consideration to see that most of them have always intended to represent Algeria. And honestly, Feghouli would start on France. After Brahimi's recent resurgence, so would he.

When insulting someone, the context is important. You can't just put a gender theory context onto everything. Calling a guy for ""dick"" doesn't mean anything else than calling him a ""cunt"" or an ""idiot"", depending on the intercontextual meaning.

You may think it's society who puts certain standards upon us. Calling men for ""cunt"" is a reference to the female sex and therefor also means ""weak"", and vice versa with dick. But that's not always the case. Some times those words were just uttered by the sender because he or she felt they were right.

I completely agree with you, that people in general shouldn't call each other for gay, cunt, dick, etc., because it can imply that those words become synonyms with the word idiot, which I'm very against.

On the other hand, *words are just words*. And uttering a specific word may not have a clear specific meaning. That's just how we people interact with each other. Just like we can say grammatical incorrect sentences and use wrong words here and there, but the meaning will still be quite clear in a normal conversation.

Your opinion isn't one held by the Highway Code which states drivers should merge in turn. Use all available lanes and swap lanes when necessary. 

There is no 'correct' lane. Only available lanes, of which the closing lane is still one until it is closed. 

You can cry about it, and be a dick to other people on the road if you like as long as you realise that you're the one in the wrong.

Christianity was repelled from Wales.
&gt;In contrast to the Church of England, the Church in Wales is not an established church. Disestablishment was effected in 1920, under the Welsh Church Act 1914. It kept all its church buildings including those that dated to before the Reformation. 

In Christianity...
&gt; The Book of Revelation, often known simply as Revelation or The Apocalypse, is a book of the New Testament that occupies a central place in Christian eschatology. 

And it says:
&gt; ""And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."" (Revelation 12:3)

&gt; ""And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority."" (Revelation 13:2)

&gt;""And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."" (Revelation 12:9)

&gt;""And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast..."" (Revelation 13:4)

&gt; ""And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."" (Revelation 16:13-14)

It's literally the highest price I've seen (Even Finland's Okiluto unit 3 EPR, a novel design that's been plagued with cost overruns and delays, is only set to cost $6.02/W).

Still, you don't need that much juice, and power reactors aren't really great for producing radioisotopes (it requires a refueling and refining step, and even then, you're only getting back something like 5% of your fuel in mutagenous radioactives).

You could get a TRIGA Mark III research reactor for just [$270,000](http://www.nti.org/facilities/8/) in 1969 dollars ($1.75 million in 2014, or 1.2 million GBP), and save the majority of the cost of your Dalek army.

TRIGAs run on high-enriched fuel, so they get a much better rate of fission product production per fuel mass - with that ""little"" 2 MWth device, you could kick out enough isotopes to irradiate your entire team of PhD students.

In short, I think you could start the Time War for just 132,014,192.81 GBP.  A bargain, really.  Not even half most countries' military budget.

**Product claims:** *""Topical Vitamin C must be in the form of L-ascorbic acid to be useful to the body and skin.

To be effective a product should contain a concentration of at least 10%.*  
*In creams, lotions, and serums the Vitamin C oxidises quickly and loses its therapeutic potency. If you buy a product containing Vitamin C off the shelf it is likely to have lost its effectiveness. We now add Ferulic Acid to our Vitamin C products because Ferulic Acid has the wonderful ability to stabilise Vitamin C thus ensuring it retains its potency. We also now add Vitamin E acetate to the serum.""*  
**About you:** Early 20s, easily dehydrated and dry skin. Looking to keep skin looking bright and full as well as even out tone and texture.  
**Your opinion:** Will update after I have finished the bottle, currently only 2 weeks in, once a day use.  
It's certainly not of your average serum consistency, it's 100% a lotion, stored in a small pump bottle. It's a funny consistency, when you first apply the lotion, it feels and looks like there is no way it will absorb into your skin, but with a bit of rubbing in it easily does. I'm likely to finish it within the two months recommended. It smells odd, vinegary, but this dies down after I apply the rest of my routine. It's housed in a far more hydrating base than other L-AA serums I have tried, which is a big selling point for me. Results wise? I'm not sure, it's definitely not instantaneous like the Active Formulas or OST serum, but I'm beginning to think that was just down to their exfoliating action. I am going to start keeping a photo diary and will update this review when I complete the product

---

&gt;Tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel is a type of micro fuel particle. It consists of a fuel kernel composed of [UOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_dioxide) (sometimes [UC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_carbide) or UCO) in the center, coated with four layers of three [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic#Physics) materials. The four layers are a porous buffer layer made of carbon, followed by a dense inner layer of [pyrolytic carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolytic_carbon) (PyC), followed by a ceramic layer of [SiC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide) to retain fission products at elevated temperatures and to give the TRISO particle more structural integrity, followed by a dense outer layer of PyC. TRISO fuel particles are designed not to crack due to the stresses from processes (such as differential thermal expansion or fission gas pressure) at temperatures up to and beyond 1600 °C, and therefore can contain the fuel in the worst of accident scenarios in a properly designed reactor. Two such reactor designs are the [pebble-bed reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble-bed_reactor) (PBR), in which thousands of TRISO fuel particles are dispersed into graphite pebbles, and the prismatic-block gas-cooled reactor (such as the [GT-MHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT-MHR)), in which the TRISO fuel particles are fabricated into compacts and placed in a graphite block matrix. Both of these reactor designs are [high temperature gas reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-high-temperature_reactor) (HTGRs). These are also the basic reactor designs of [very-high-temperature reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-high-temperature_reactor) (VHTRs), one of the six classes of reactor designs in the [Generation IV initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor) that is attempting to reach even higher HTGR outlet temperatures.

However, we are continually pointing to this right as the main cornerstone of the steps to solve the problem of Islamic extremism among young, disaffected British Muslims.  If not shouting, then certainly speaking loudly.

&gt;&gt;OK, I accept that you have the free-speech rights to say what you like, but is criticizing Islam a good thing if it upsets Muslims?
&gt;
&gt;To which I repeat my answer above: The only way we can tell good ideas from the bad is to allow all ideas to be mercilessly criticized. No exceptions!
&gt;
&gt;Yes, it will upset people to see their beliefs challenged, but that's the price we all pay for living in an open society.

Tbh, I'd agree with your summation - although I'd add the proviso ""in this circumstance"" at the end.  It's not about not upsetting people - some people certainly deserve to be criticised, and they probably will be upset.  Rather, it's about changing that criticism depending on the circumstance.

I'd also disagree specifically with the idea that criticising Islam is by default a worthwhile issue, and really what we're discussing here at all.  Islam is huge and nebulous, and a lot of different people have some considerably different views on how to interpret it.  Of course, there are valid criticisms to make of Islam (for example, I strongly dislike the Islamic description of a god that is not intrinsically relational, nor the repeated emphasis on salvation through deeds when it seems clear to me that no human could ever do anything cosmically significant enough to deserve salvation).  I personally believe these are valid criticisms of the Islamic religion.

However, specifically, I suspect most of us would also disagree with and criticise extremist fundamentalism.  Indeed, there's a huge number of grounds on which to criticise it, ranging from ""it's not necessary, we aren't in a war"" to ""your holy book, your holy leaders, and your own God condemn murder in this manner"".  But note that here we're not criticising Islam.  We're criticising a very small subset of Islam.  In fairness, it's a small subset that doesn't necessarily apply just to Islam - Breivik had similarly revolutionary ideas to the ones that can be seen in certain Islamic terrorists.

So when Muslim leaders condemn the constant criticism of Islam, you can begin to see their point.  We're not doing it rationally or sensibly, based from a theologically or sociologically sound viewpoint, having weighed together all the facets of an entire religion with varying sets of beliefs, with any specific targets being stated, and with respect and dignity involved.  No, very often we're targeting Islam in general over a minority belief that is widely condemned by (nearly - and that is an issue that I accept we need to sort out) all of the relevant Islamic authorities.

The worrying thing is that this is a natural issue that occurs amongst most young people.  Just look at reddit for an example of disaffected youths angrily demanding the overthrowing of western governments and an overhaul of democracy whenever they get the chance.  This isn't an issue specific to young Muslims.  The part that *is* highly specific is the ability to gain an ""Islamic"" identity (see IS literally calling themselves ""Islamic State""), and the political strength of force in certain areas that makes genuine revolution an actual possibility.  Note that this cause has nothing to do with free speech - that's entirely a secondary issue that arises (and here I guess you are somewhat right) when we criticise these attempts at revolution.  No, to fundamentally reconnect with young extremist Muslims, we need to ensure that they are able to feel a part of the British identity (albeit without compromise on ""British values"", whatever they are).

Or, to tl;dr this, criticising ""Islam"" is stupid and pointless unless you have some idea of what ""Islam"" as a whole actually means; criticising Islamic extremism is completely acceptable, and should continue to take place because it's wrong; OTOH, and specifically to the question of the best way to reduce the statistics of radical disaffected Muslim youths in this country, the discussion on the rights to free speech are irrelevant (or even harmful at times\*) when we're refusing to deal with the actual issue that is how to engage Muslim youths in our national identity.

Also, sorry for how long this is!  I think I sort of rambled on a bit too much.  As someone who has lived most of their life in close proximity to Muslims, and as a Christian identifying with the issues of balancing religion and state, this is one of those issues that really gets me going.  I just want to reiterate that I fundamentally agree with the right to free speech!  That said, rights have never had as much interest to me as the more important responsibilities that come with them.  Specifically here I'd suggest that the responsibility to be tactful is more important that the right to be brash, but now I'm just rambling on again.  I'm heading to bed now, but I'd love to continue this tomorrow if you want.

If that's the case then the cynical view would be that it was done knowing that a contract wouldn't be signed, so as to set the narrative of 'why' when a contract isn't signed and he joins another Premier League club for nothing in the summer.

I'm very sceptical of this whole contract impasse with Milner. He's a valuable player to the club, and I think he's played his cards very close to his chest. He was offered a new contract a long time ago and he declined, I think this was always a calculated move to strengthen his negotiating position.

He may want to leave in the summer, but he could've easily done so with our blessings had he signed contract a year or two ago, but he didn't sign on the dotted line.

That strengthens his hand: he has a wider list of suitors due to the potential free transfer, the prospect of a large signing on fee, and possibly more regular playing time.

However, it doesn't demonstrate loyalty to the club. Loyalty to the club would be signing a contract a year ago with the understanding that should Milner wish to leave at some stage that the club listen to reasonable offers for him and allow him to leave without hindrance given his service to the club.

That would've been the best arrangement for both parties, but it never happened, and you have to ask why.

And, should this speculative article be true, Milner holding out for a large 4 year contract at the age of 29 isn't entirely in the club's best interests either. But should it be true, Milner knows he has us by the balls, and he's negotiating from a position of strength.

I'd say that Pearce has a fair shot at keeping her seat this time around - at the last general election, the height of Labour's unpopularity, the Tory candidate only managed to get 30% of the vote to Pearce's 44%. I'd expect a return to 2005 levels this time around, maybe tempered by the rise of smaller parties - so just under
 50% Labour.

Bexleyheath has only been blue since 2005, coinciding with the start of the bad feeling building up towards Labour (grievances over wars, Blair, etc.), and Evennett has been secure there for the last decade - long enough to build up a good power base. Even with a potential Labour resurgence and developing resentment against the Tories, we probably won't see anything as close as 2001, where Nigel Beard held the seat by just over a thousand votes. IMO, Evennett will hold on to it comfortably - there's just too much ground for Labour to cover.

Old Bexley is traditionally Tory and has been for decades - it was Ted Heath's old seat, which should tell you something. The gulf between Labour and Conservative voters has only been getting wider since Heath stepped down in 2001, and I can't see a significant reversal happening there.

null,false,grollcool,null,null,null,"&gt; I'm saying your logic is faulty. By saying ""the one who's a decade younger,"" you're implying youth gets priority.

My logic isn't faulty, you are just wrong. Goalkeepers generally only get better with age, I am not saying Courtois is a better goalkeeper because he is younger, but from the clubs position, its is much advantageous to keep and develop the 22 year old, than to keep playing the 32 year old. Their skill isn't relevant because they both are very good keepers and any difference between the two is negligible. From a simplistic point of view they are both amazing keepers but Cech has more experience, while Courtois has more natural ability, i.e aerial dominance and size. You don't lose much starting one over the other, which makes the age an even more important aspect of this decision.

Please keep down voting me though. The fact that you guys think a 10 year gap is something you can just gloss over is astonishing. Even more so when your logic is that Cech is in his prime. Well if Courtois isn't in his prime and is just as good as Cech what does that say about Courtois?

&gt;Still no. I'm just pointing out when something is bigoted and does nothing positive.   


What was bigoted about calling two fathers gay? 


&gt;&gt; Making gay jokes is just that, jokes.  

&gt;No. That is demonstrably false. Jokes are not just anything; there is A LOT more behind them and how they connect to society and societal roles as a whole.   

Like? Actual gay bashing is on its way out. Black people make black people jokes, white people make black people jokes, blacks make white people jokes, so do whites. Gay comedians make fun of other gays using a lot of slurs or insults so do straight ones. They're *words*, if you let *one* wisecrack make you angry, that's on you. 


&gt;&gt; If a gay person asks me to stop in their presence, I will. If somebody who gets offended on gay people's behalf asks me to stop, I'll tell em to fuck off.  

&gt; I'm asking you to stop, and I am most assuredly not straight.   


To stop what? I haven't made any gay jokes in your presence. 

&gt;&gt; Not what I said at all. Re-read and get back to me. 

&gt;Okay...

...and? 


&gt;&gt; As far as using gay slurs as insults? Get the fuck over it. I don't do it, I think those that do are close-minded, but I also don't see why people get up in arms about it. 

&gt;Why get over something that has a negative cultural impact? Why not rid the world of it? Close minded or not is redundant because it is negatively inpacting society. Up in arms? If pointing how it is negative is up in arms then it should be obvious why people are doing it.

Nothing. But that's not what happened. He called two fathers gay as a way of insulting them. 

&gt; Like? Actual gay bashing is on its way out. Black people make black people jokes, white people make black people jokes, blacks make white people jokes, so do whites

And race relations are suuuuuuper great right now! /s come on, those kinds of jokes feed stereotypes and that in turn feeds bigotry. 

&gt;  Gay comedians make fun of other gays using a lot of slurs or insults so do straight ones. They're *words*, if you let *one* wisecrack make you angry, that's on you. 

Well for one, no one is angry here, at least not me. But also continuing those jokes –no matter who says them– is how the negativity spreads. It needs that kind of environment to thrive, one where people are not holding themselves accountable for the sentiments behind their words. 

&gt; To stop what? I haven't made any gay jokes in your presence. 

Yet you are defending them? Regardless, there is never a time to defend them. Gay jokes in the presence of ANYONE are negative, no homosexual need be present for them to have a negative impact.

Oh did he? I'm glad you can read his mind.

&gt;And race relations are suuuuuuper great right now! /s come on, those kinds of jokes feed stereotypes and that in turn feeds bigotry. 


Nice strawman. There's a fine line between racism and blacks&amp;whites sharing jokes about one another. Chris Rock standup is a great example.

&gt;Well for one, no one is angry here, at least not me. But also continuing those jokes –no matter who says them– is how the negativity spreads. It needs that kind of environment to thrive, one where people are not holding themselves accountable for the sentiments behind their words. 


Here's the thing, it doesn't need that kind of environment to thrive. The environment is created by the ultra religious people who see homosexuality as a sin, and the ignorant homophobic people who don't understand it in general. Rational forward thinking people making a casual gay or straight joke doesn't contribute to it. I'm sorry you see it that way. 

&gt;&gt; To stop what? I haven't made any gay jokes in your presence. 

&gt;Yet you are defending them? Regardless, there is never a time to defend them. Gay jokes in the presence of ANYONE are negative, no homosexual need be present for them to have a negative impact. 


I'm defending this guy, because you got up in arms over his saying that two fathers are gay and branched off into saying that it's people like him who make gay people kill their self. What makes a gay jokes said by somebody, gay or not, different than a black joke said by someone, black or not?

The book you linked to about 'Polish atrocities', due to it being published by the Nazis in the aftermath of their invasion of Poland, is quite obviously a biased source, and as such cannot be taken at face value. The Obersalzberg Speech, given by Hitler to his military commanders not long before launching their own atrocities upon the Polish (see the exterminations of Operation Tannenberg, for example), puts the rationale for this propaganda piece in context:

&gt; I have issued the command – and I’ll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad – that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formation in readiness – for the present only in the East – with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the Lebensraum which we need.

The suggestion that Hitler's halt order regarding Dunkirk was an act of goodwill has been debunked; in particular, one of Hitler's subsequent directives, issued on the same day, stated that ""[the] next object of our operations in to annihilate the French, English, and Belgian forces that are encircled in Artois and Flanders."" With that in mind, Blumentritt's account reads more like Hitler attempting to save face after what turned out to be a tactical blunder on his part.

Hitler's diatribe on ""international Jewry"" and his claim that WWII was ""desired and instigated exclusively by those international statesmen who were either of Jewish descent or worked for Jewish interests"" is again, obvious Nazi propaganda that does not hold up to any scrutiny. He was, of course, well aware of the Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland. As such, by invading Poland (on a false flag pretext, i.e. Operation Himmler), he instigated WWII.

Boots has much the same, but also Liz Earle, Smashbox, Bumble and Bumble and Ojon. 

In the indoor market there's a shop called The Powder Room (right by the indoor entrance that's close-ish to Boots that sells some US cosmetics, discounted perfumes and French skincare and lots of things like W7 which are hard to find in physical stores.

In M&amp;S they sell Philip Kingsley, Leighton Denny, REN, and more I can't remember.

The large stores in St David's shopping centre are open til 8 weekdays and their MAC store recently opened. Superdrug are trailing a premium-beauty shop there too, so The Balm etc are sold there.

You're using the slippery slope fallacy when you argue that an American actor would suggest turning it into a McDonalds.  The TARDIS and the Doctor are linked, as the show has told us, but if there's one thing you should have taken away from the 50+ years of Doctor Who is that while the actor plays the Doctor, *the Doctor is not the actor*.  We've had over a dozen different actors play the role of the Doctor, an alien from another world.  They've each had their own nuances, their own ways of speaking and accents, their own mannerisms and little quirks and personalities, but *all of them have been the Doctor*.  

The moment you start limiting the character, the Doctor, by saying what he *must* be, the more you diminish the absolute plethora of facets there are to display in the gem that he is.

I'm sorry you weren't happy with Tennant's accent in Gracepoint.  I personally thought he did okay - can't quite tell which part of the country he's trying for, but that's okay because there's as many varied and different accents in the USA as there are in the UK.  Heck, accents change over a handful of miles in some places.

The ""reality"" is that Doctor Who is a show produced in Britain, and that the character, ""The Doctor"" is an alien from another world who can potentially regenerate into any body type, any gender, any voice, and any personality.  He was written that way - *that* is the reality.

Changing the actor from one person to another has *never* made the show lose its true meaning.  That's been proven a dozen times now since the inception of the show.

What exactly do you think the ""true meaning"" of the show is anyway, if casting someone from outside the UK will ruin it?

And again, I'm taking the opposing viewpoint not because I want a particular change, but to see where other peoples reasoning comes from.  In your case, it seems to be ""The show is British so the actor should be British"", which is...more an emotional argument than a tangible reason.",null,0,null,1423968508,null,0,false,0,colsi5t,null,t3_2vw7xy,null,t1_colsi5t,null,t1_colr7a3,null,null,null,1424597788,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

College is a time to explore stuff and enjoy yourself, but you're also there to learn and prepare for your future. Basically people who get into trouble at college fall into one of two broad categories: overcontrolled or undercontrolled.

The overcontrolled people tend to be anxious, achievement-oriented, and stress themselves out completely taking too many credits, joining everything imaginable, etc. They need to learn how to relax and take care of themselves.

The undercontrolled people stay up super late, party all the time, skip class, cram before exams, get lost in videogames, etc. They need to learn how to be responsible for themselves.

My advice: figure out which one of those you're more likely to be and start taking steps to figure out how you'll be balanced.

While he has featured a lot for Everton, it could just be that Martinez is trying to justify the fee that they paid for him. 

I'm not questioning his fitness levels at all, I think he's a superb athlete and one of the strongest strikers in the league. I'm more questioning his play style, he's not one to really press.

null,false,Starlifter141,null,null,null,"I have no problem with a female Master and really like Michelle Gomez in the role.  I liked Romana and the Rani as female Time Lords.  And I like the female astrophysicist (Dr. Katrina Jones played by Barbara Sukowa) in 12 Monkeys that built and operates a time machine.  The fate of humanity is in her hands.  She has no problem with sending people (males so far) through time, often to their deaths.  She sent them through time to test the machine.  She sends them through time to find and kill those that created/released the virus that wiped out mankind.  She’s as ruthless as the Doctor is when the greater good is at stake.


I would be okay with a minority Time Lord although I prefer the status quo.  Having said that, the only precedent that has been set is for a change between genders.  I really like Dr. Jones but I am not sure I want to see a female Doctor, because:


(1)	the formula they have now works – and if it works don’t fix it
(2)	don’t change just to be politically correct – it’s about the right actor for the role
(3)	writers may accentuate stereotypical female or feminine qualities too much.
(4)	more cultural bias against it than for it in many of the places it is seen – potentially impacting viewer numbers


Would a female Doctor played in a manner similar to the way Missy was played work?  Would viewers want to see the Doctor behave like this all the time, every episode?  Or would she be seen as another version of Clara or Donna?


What if a Doctor/Companion dispute is seen as taking on the characteristics of a cat fight, or any complaining changes from “being Scottish” to “being bitchy”?  What might be no big deal in one or two episodes may become a big deal over the course of a season.


While some wanted the Rani to return, would a female Doctor be better accepted if played like, but not copying, the Rani?  A female Doctor developed along the lines of the character that Sigourney Weaver played in the Alien movies would certainly work.  The lead role in the first Alien movie was written for a male actor.  Weaver successfully auditioned for the role as it was written.  The script was not reworked to turn it into a role written for a female character. Her role as a scientist in Avatar also showed what a strong female character could do.  And the female astrophysicist in 12 Monkeys is pretty bad ass.  But Alien and Avatar aren't time travel movies, and with the exception of 12 Monkeys, historically women have been the sidekick to the male time traveler.  


Would the viewers go for a younger or older female as the Doctor?  I can guess what the male viewers (and writers) would probably prefer. A female Doctor would have an effect on the gender and roles of Companions. Would Companions now number more males than females – and would they be younger or older than the Doctor? Would the TARDIS become cougar town?


How accepted will having a female (as the Doctor) in a strong position of authority be with the various degrees of cultural and religious beliefs out there today?  Would that hurt or help viewer numbers?  One cultural viewership’s acceptance of a female Doctor might be another cultural viewership’s rejection.


What happens if a male Companion takes the more physical role in a confrontation or fight, or has to save a female Doctor?  Will it be the same dynamic as when a female Companion saves the Doctor?  Will a female Doctor become, or be seen as, reliant on the male Companion to save the day?


How would the viewers react when the female Doctor takes a life or sends someone to certain doom?  Missy can do it. Can the Missus Doctor do it and have it be accepted?


Interactions between a female Doctor and Madame Vastra/Jenny would take on new meaning. If there was already an established female Companion from a previous male Doctor, how would the relationship change with the Doctor now being female?  Or better yet what kind of interaction would there be between a female Doctor and a female Master?  Who would snog who?


It would add yet another twist if, at some future point, the Doctor returned to Gallifrey and a family reunion or family life of some sort while female.


TL;DR   I’m female, and I like to think I’m open to change, but I am not ready to see the Doctor running down corridors in lipstick, heels and a dress (Missy – okay, Companion – yes, Doctor – NO).

Thing is, sums like what we had last window dont come around too often. If I was Rodgers, I'd be extra extra careful with such huge amounts of money. If I cant find what I need right now, I'd save up, and then get match-winners. I dont understand his obsession with potential. You can actually have too much at one point. You need older heads who've won things in the mix. That's how a winning team is formed, from what I;ve seen over the years. Otherwise, you risk becoming Arsenal and then a selling club.

According to the [UK Census 2011] (http://localstats.qpzm.co.uk/stats/england/south-east/west-oxfordshire/chipping-norton) Muslims make up 0.5% of the population of Chipping Norton compared to 4.41% nationwide, this is a big difference.

Now when you go to a city (Leicester here is an extreme case but I'm from there so it's the one I'll use) you'll notice there are more Muslims there than anywhere else but you'll also notice that they're in their own communities and in Leicester that's [Stoneygate](http://localstats.qpzm.co.uk/stats/england/east-midlands/leicester/stoneygate) (50% Muslim) and [Spinney Hills](http://localstats.qpzm.co.uk/stats/england/east-midlands/leicester/spinney-hills) (70% Muslim). Now there are Muslims in other parts of Leicester too but in much smaller proportions. Now when you compare this to the fact that Leicester is in fact 19% you see that they do group together. I know this is not only true of Leicester from personal experience but I don't know other areas well enough to know where to look. 

I have no idea what you're saying with ""forcibly segregated"". No one's making them live in those areas it's just the way people are. They tend to all group up together along the same culture, the Hindus do it too but people don't really care as while they still have their bad points it's nowhere near as bad as the Muslims and all those people are much more accepting of British culture than the Muslims.

The full quote is 

“I have a feeling that prohibition in this whole area simply isn’t working. Every year we say that we are going to fight the war on drugs harder than we have fought it the year before. And I think this is one of those areas of life, and, whilst people may find this distasteful, I think we need a proper full Royal Commission on this whole area of drugs to investigate whether perhaps life might be better for millions of people living on council estates that are dominated by the drugs dealers, that are dominated by the crime that surrounds, the money that people raise, to get these drugs, let’s find out through a Royal Commission whether perhaps we should decriminalise drugs, whether we should license them, license the users, and sell them at Boots – because frankly if you add up the costs of drugs to society the big problem is the fact that they’re criminal and everything that goes with that. And I think there is an argument that says if we decriminalised it we would make the lives of millions of people far better than they are today.”

Some of them still are. I've said this here that Can, Markovic, Sturridge and Coutinho have been his hits. But the majority arent. And when there was a big chance last window, over-lord Rodgers with this merry committee fucked it up.

From my perspective - there have been other times when we've had a team + manager poised for incredible potential. Briefly under Evans, Houllier and sustainedly under Benitez. There have also been other times when we've been absolutely shit these past two decades. 

Since about midway through the 2012 season though, there has been a definite sense that we are building - both in playing/management style as well as ownership/financial structure.  That combination of ownership/financial strength + manager/team cohesion has been lacking for these many years, and it is finally back again. I don't remember anyone in my father's generation ever truly worrying or questioning, or even taking a deep curiousity in our finances, but our generation of fans do - as a result of the modern game and competition. 

All in all - there is nothing to do but be patient. Success is no longer owed to us. My father's generation felt it was, and the whole of the 90's for me was clouded by that expectation. None of our success then was ever good enough.  

I don't want to allow the future to be clouded either by a sense of impatience or expectation. I enjoy our wins and deeply feel our losses. And then I carry on believing. We'll have success, don't ever doubt it.

My friend and I came up with a somewhat convoluted drinking game for this show. We're a bit obsessed. 

Basically, you set up your couch / chair whatever situation in front of your TV, underneath it, you put a small triangle of cups like you would in beer pong (ideally, you want a solid 10-15 feet between you and the cups). Every time certain things happen in the show, everyone takes a shot at the cups, if you make it, everyone else does half a shot of some hard liquor (e.g. vodka) or a full shot of some weaker liquor (e.g. triple sec). If everyone makes it, or multiple people make it, everyone takes shots, or the winners can do rock, paper, scissors to decide who takes the shot.

The shooting criteria are based on each character and some generic things to keep it going:

* Opening credits / Ending credits
* Commercial break
* They show the outside of Paddy's
* Anytime the gang makes fun of Dee or calls her ""Sweet Dee""
* Anytime Charlie wears his [PJ's](http://i.imgur.com/6hW5MLJ.jpg), or his illiteracy is mentioned
* Anytime Mac does something badass or his latent homosexuality is mentioned
* Anytime Dennis does something 'sexy'
* Anytime Frank ""has a guy"" or he pulls out a gun
* Anytime a recurring character shows up (e.g. Rickety Cricket, Artemis, The Waitress)

It sounds like a lot, but if you're as shitty at hitting the cups as we are, you'll probably average a shot or 2 per episode.
This game works best if binge watching seasons since some episodes you might only take 5-6 shots at the cups.

We also had some more esoteric things like if the ping pong ball rolls back to you and you can get it *without your asscheeks coming off the couch*, you can take another shot. The key is to just have fun with it. If you get bored, just start taking shots at the cups until you make it and start drinking.",null,0,null,1423986671,null,0,false,0,colz6if,null,t3_2vwdrn,null,t1_colz6if,null,t1_colh18o,null,null,null,1424600971,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

What she said was:

Manquillo on loan is also perfect, where we might keep him longer if Atletico does not want him back. Lambert has been a little bit disappointment where i was hoping for more goals, but can`t expect a lot for a striker we did pay 4m for and was supposed to be our third striker.

If you only have 1-2 hours, and you want to take a walk instead of driving, you could try the Southern route around the park. Drive in, do a walk, and then keep going to the Lake District.

Consider a trip to Ilam and Dovedale. Ilam is noted for its unusual Swiss-style cottages, and there is a popular walk on some stepping stones across a river. A walk around [Ilam hall](http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/ilam-hall) and the river is also lovely.

Total time should be about 2 hours depending on your walking speed.

There is a social housing shortage precisely because of all the right to buy stupidity that has already happened.

It is nothing but a windfall profit for the tenant, who, acting entirely rationally, buys the property at a bargain price then sells it to a private landlord for a taxpayer-supplied profit.

The private landlord then rents it back, at considerably higher price, since the higher rent is justified by the higher investment of the price they paid for it (remember the tenant got the windfall, and at this point it is the new BTL owner who has paid it until he can recoup it from the next set of tenants).

Since the amount of property is near enough fixed, all that does is raise prices for everyone on average -- and in particular on the social tenants that move into the new privately owned rented property, paid for by the state.  What have we achieved then?  A social housing tenant in a house paying a higher rent than they did previously, with the difference going to the private landlord, and a very happy ex-tenant who has had a windfall profit -- how is that helping long term?

Governments should not be selling social housing. The taxpayer gets best return on their money by building more social housing, not by selling it. The social tenant, on average, is better off because rents are lower.

What's more building more social housing increases the supply of housing and so we are less likely to end up in another economy-destroying bubble.

Fees can often be set at a fixed sum for dealing with a particular issue (eg a single large transaction or a court case) or they can be hourly for work done on those things. Then there is 'success based payment' (no win no fee).

I'm not sure what vehicle lets you play a whole game without dying. The AC130 is stupid and definitely OP but they're not all that common. Chances are if there is a vehicle dominating the map then the opposition team just aren't countering it properly. 

Obviously you're entitled to hate it if you want, but for me nothing can beat playing conquest on battlefield with a squad of friends, working as a team and playing the objective.
 
BF4 has plenty of ways of encouraging teamwork, and the secret to success does rely on cooperation, but ultimately it's still up to players to take those options. Casual players (no disrespect  to yourself) and recent converts to the series might not always be aware of the differences to other shooters with regards to teamwork and that's where the game can fall down. I don't think BF games have ever been *really* organised though, unless you play as a clan. Organised chaos perhaps.

 
I agree that's not very friendly towards casual players though, especially with regards to weapon and kit unlocks.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"&gt;I was arguing 'low-growth' versus 'high-growth'. I would prefer better-managed low growth to toxic high growth. I think we are currently experiencing toxic high growth, where little of our economic prosperity seems to 'trickle down' (I'm told it's supposed to).


We are experiencing higher growth at the moment due to the spare capacity in in the economy I believe, basically it’s not working at its fully efficiency. I to would also advocate for stable growth as apposed to toxic growth, as it was partly Labour policy that caused our unsustainable growth in the early 2000s. As for prosperity trickling down I would remind you that it is still early days and that it is coming according to the latest figures.

&gt;And you think this is what Ed Milliband, the Greens or, indeed, any actual political party stands for?

Nope, but I have a fear that they will push themselves into acting in that way to please their voters much like they are doing with their economic policy.


&gt;I am not saying that most of our work-force is zero-hour contracts. I am saying that most of the jobs created by the Conservative government are. For this reason, I don't consider the current government's policies with regards to employment as successful and cannot therefore see how Labour would do worse.

Not **most** but admittedly a larger percentages than before. When it is the choice between low unemployment and low quality jobs or high unemployment and high quality jobs, I choose the low unemployment. Look at the huge rates of unemployment in the south of Europe and France, where the average youth unemployment is around 25%, the same as the USA in the Great depression.


&gt;What if the additional debt has a good ROI that, long-term, surpasses any surplus we may run now? I'm not sure how realistic a surplus of 1% for 15 years is anyway (that's not meant to be sarcastic - I genuinely don't know).


I have thought about this and never got around to doing the rough calculation. However I don’t think it works out, I think the UK would go bankrupt long before then either due to another crisis or a loss of market confidence. That or we end up following  Japan, where business are forced to buy government bonds rather than invest in innovation.

(I'm guessing you're American - Stonehenge seems to be an obsession with American visitors.

null,false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"Good question! The legal market has changed enormously over the last ten years for a number of reasons. 

Firstly, the events of 2009 left a lot of firms set back because their clients had lost a huge quantity of revenue. Suddenly, in order to retain clients, firms had to offer much more competitive fee structures, mostly meaning a large increase in fixed fee, because businesses became far more conscious of their budgets. Firms also had to offer services more efficiently since they simply couldn't afford to keep on many of their staff. 

So much for the corporate firms. As for crime, family, public law etc, those guys have been decimated by the legal aid cuts. These days, the only people who can reasonably become criminal barristers are ones with enough money tucked away to survive on nothing for a couple of years at the start of their career. Solicitors are increasingly carrying out their own advocacy, which has led to lower costs but plummeting qualities of advocacy in court, likely resulting in a lot of poor outcomes. Family law has been the hardest hit by Grayling's cuts, and a lot of family lawyers are really struggling. 

Finally, law firms are reorganising to become more competitive and clients are beginning to look for a 'one stop shop' particularly in the corporate world. Due to a recent legislative change to allow for 'Alternative Business Structures' we are going to start seeing law firms that are also consultancy and accountancy firms, or accountancy firms offer expanded legal services. 

All of this has led to much more austerity in the legal profession overall (compared to the past), and they are becoming more ruthlessly competitive with one another to secure the business. In the City, the US firms have given the Magic Circle an enormous kick up the arse, paying their associates double for the same job (and thus getting many of the best people) and offering very competitive fees.

It might have been a bit misleading to say that the clients' needs are rapidly changing. They always are, but it is a bit of corporate speak. Really, the legal profession is experiencing upheaval unlike any other in recent memory.

Anyway, the point is that the legal market is competitive and ruthless, possibly more so than any other, and as far as I have seen does not operate as a cartel.

null,false,lobbmaster,null,null,null,"Okey.. let's go through your points here:

&gt; ""Easy CL Group"" if you thought Real and Basel were gonna be easy for a first time CL manager and a team bereft of CL experience then you had it coming.

Maybe you just missed this but I wrote : ""easy"" CL group, which means that it's relatively easy but still difficult. We almost made it out of the group by scoring a couple of goals and playing the way we did, that sais a lot about our group.. 

&gt; Second, our formation didn't change after the Basel game, it changed after the Palace away game. Rodgers didn't do a U-turn of any sort, he came up with a new formation since the current one wasn't working. And none of you critcs, NONE OF YOU ever suggested going a 3-4-2-1. People were like he should bring back the diamond and play 2 up front.

That's just wrong, we played 5 more games with the same players and 4 at the back after the Crystal Palace away game (Ludo 2-2, Stoke 1-0, Leicester 1-3, Sunderland 0-0 and Basel 1-1)

Against Basel on December the 9th we played with 4 at the back (Johnson Skrtel Lovren Enrique) and against United on December the 14th we played our first game with 3 at the back (Skrtel, Lovren, Johnson).

Maybe U-turn is the wrong word, but my point is that he changed playstyle/tactics/formation completely and that this wasn't something he had been trying for 3-4 months and it finally clicked. You're probably right that noone suggested 3 at the back, but people did suggest to start more creative and faster players + lucas and sakho. Almost everyone wanted to change from 4-5-1 but Rodgers stood by it for weeks/months, which meant we played for almost 80minutes before we created a goal chance against Basel. 

Yes 3 at the back has worked very well and I gave Rodgers credit for the changes he made in the original post.

&gt; Rodger's tactical ability gave us an unorthodox formation that turned the tide. The players he bought took time to settle in, which many of you critics were already calling flops. 

No, some idiots called them flops and wanted Rodgers sacked, but me and very many others didn't. A majority here wanted Rodgers to play Lallana, Markovic, Emre Can, Sakho, Lucas etc more and that is a fact. 

It took 4 months for the players to settle in? Markovic and Can for example got 20 minutes in some games etc early in the season and looked very promising, but it still took 4 months before they were given a real chance, and that was 3-4 months were the starters weren't performing at all. 

Minutes that some of our key players now played in the PL before December the 14th:

Emre Can: 18 minutes (!!!), and he wasn't even injured! 

Markovic: 203 minutes (out of 1400 possible minutes)

Sakho: 250 minutes

Lucas: 380 minutes

Not sure how Lucas and Sakho needed 4 months to settle..

&gt; There were even people on her bemoaning his substitutions which made me pull my hair out because Rodgers is one of the few managers who effectively changes games with his subsitutions (e.g. Lallana and Balo for the winner against Spurs).

He is one of the managers that CAN change games with his substitutions, but there are plenty of games this season were that has not been the case. Yes Lallana and Balotelli worked great against Tottenham, and it was exactly the sub many wanted against Chelsea when Rodgers instead put on Lambert and Balotelli for Sterling and Coutinho, giving us no creativity in the midfield. 

&gt; So please, save me this hindsight crap and eat your humble pie. Those who were patient, who understood a new team would take time, and who always believed Rodgers was the right man to lead us through thought all of you critics were joke supporters.    

Haha, man you say a lot of bullshit. You ""understood"" that playing 4-5-1 with only players that have been in the club for more than 2 years was the way to go and that it would work in the end? Liverpools change in form is thanks to Rodgers, but it's NOT a result of a system finally working, it's a result of Rodgers suddenly CHANGING a system (and the players involved). All of Can, Moreno, Markovic, Lucas, Sakho etc were suddenly ready at the same time in December?

Way to generalise the critics, I (and many others) didn't want Rodgers fired or anything, but we did want a change in formation and tactics (and players used), we wanted the team to attack more, we wanted faster and more dangerous players on the team, we begged Rodgers to play Markovic, Can, Sakho, Lucas etc more.

null,false,chadwini,null,null,null,"Jose Fonte. Current team captain. Centre back.
  
Jose Miguel da Rocha Fonte played for a number of countries in his native Portugal before moving on loan and eventually permanently to Crystal Palace in 2007. After a number of seasons in the Championship with Palace, Fonte move down to the third tier to sign for Alan Pardew’s Southampton in 2010 for around £1.2m. The next season he was crucial to Southampton’s promotion to the Championship, and was voted Southampton’s Player of the Year. He was equally important in Southampton’s consecutive promotion to the Premier League as he forged a solid partnership with the one and only Jos Hooiveld. 
  
This partnership continued into the Premier League, but was unfortunately not as watertight. Maya Yoshida also came in to provide stiff competition, and Fonte’s place at the heart of the defence was not so secure. With the arrival of Dejan Lovren in the summer it was unclear who would be the new centre back pairing. However, Fonte stepped up – starting 35 of 38 league games and forging an excellent partnership with Lovren that meant Southampton’s was the 6th best defence that season. Lovren claimed much of the credit for this, and thus gained a £20m move to Liverpool at the end of the season as part of a mass exodus from a club in meltdown. Fonte was given the captain’s armband for the next season’s inevitable march to relegation. But a new partnership with Toby Alderweireld has led to, at the time of writing, the most clean sheets, fewest goals conceded, and the club sitting in 4th position. Much of this has been down to Fonte’s leadership, which has come on huge amounts in his time with the Saints. 
  
Although not blessed with great pace, Fonte’s reading of the game and positioning has improved markedly, and his organisation has always been a great asset. He’s comfortable on the ball, and attacks headers well in both boxes. His improvements haven’t gone unnoticed back in his home country as Fonte was recently given his first Portugal cap at the age of 31.",null,0,null,1423998584,null,0,false,0,com1l56,null,t3_2vgxbs,null,t1_com1l56,null,t3_2vgxbs,null,null,null,1424602165,null,3,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,3,null

Exactly. I mean I have played games before where I didn't know shit but the team more or less made up for it. But here it usually seems like 1 team just rolls over the other without any major issues.

&gt; Casual players (no disrespect to yourself) and recent converts to the series might not always be aware of the differences to other shooters with regards to teamwork and that's where the game can fall down

No offense taken. I am a 'hardcore' gamer, just not in BF4. I have about 1200 hours logged in TF2 and as you probably know, its reliance in teamwork is insane so it's not like I go out trying to be a lone camper.

Just to give you an idea, my favorite way of playing BF4 is Support with the LSAT LMG, infra-red scope + airburst and ammo box. I've never really gotten the hang of the other classes but in my defence, a game no matter how 'intense' needs to have a tutorial of sort. Hell, Dota 2 has a tutorial but in BF4 you're just thrust in with a gun in your hand.

That's all.

Appreciate your response, I haven't had any friends who play Battlefield 4 so it's just my opinion I run with, heh.

This is an exciting development for the local Bitcoin community and to celebrate we will be holding a launch party/meetup on Friday 27th February from 6.30pm.

This landmark event will be attended by both press and TV companies and we would like as many people as possible to join us.

As well as being able to try out the machine, there will also be a selection of short talks from various members of the group and opportunities to ask any questions you may have about any aspects of Bitcoin or related technologies.

&gt;

&gt;A __straw man__ is a common reference [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_argument) and is an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy) based on the representation of an opponent's argument.  To be successful, a straw man argument requires that the audience be ignorant or uninformed of the original argument.

&gt;The so-called typical ""attacking a straw man"" argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition by covertly replacing it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and then to refute or defeat that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the original proposition.  

&gt;This technique has been used throughout history in [polemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemic) debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery, entertaining ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking) or understanding both sides of the issue.

null,false,tralalalalalalalala_,null,null,null,"**Name of product:** Home-made vitamin C serum

**Price of product:** Looking at Amazon.uk prices, no more than 20£-40£ over 2 years; most of this money will be spent on new glass bottles, and I'm assuming you're using it all over your body daily. Instead of buying new bottles, you can boil to sanitize and reuse. 

**Where did you purchase:** all ingredients and tools from the Amazon Gods

**Your skin type**: *Thought* I had sensitive skin until joining SCA; compared to some people on here I'd actually say my skin is hardy. I'm sensitive to fragrance and prone to rashes. I get maybe 5 big hormonal pimples a month. I do BHA exfoliation and then just let them be as my goal is long-term skin care aka anti-aging. 

**Product claims:** It's fresher and at least as good as store-bought serum. And cheap enough to use all over the body to hopefully prevent some sagging; I do feel and see a difference in the quality of my body's skin after 1.5 years of use. When I'm busy I do the serum and skip body lotion. Plus the glycerine gives it a sweet tart taste and my boyfriend really enjoyed it ;) 

**Your opinion:** My dark spots from popping pimples are pretty much gone! This and AHA/BHA exfoliation really adds that ""wow factor"" brightness to skin. Although I'm too young (24) for this to be an accomplishment, strangers regularly demand my skin routine upon meeting me, as in recently the bank teller, a restaurant hostess, 3 cashiers, and this guy who was squeegeeing my window at the car wash. 

**3 simple ingredients**

Make sure you purchase [**L**-ascorbic acid](http://www.amazon.co.uk/L-ascorbic--Vitamin-powder-Pharmaceutical-grade/dp/B00BEXUTY4/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423995613&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=l+ascorbic+acid) that is **ultra fine**. Regular ascorbic acid is a nutritional supplement and not effective for skin care. Anything but ultra fine will not dissolve properly and the micro-crystals might **burn**. The powder should dissolve completely clear into water, as I will explain later, and it's easy to tell if this is not the case. 

It's recommended to use distilled water, but I'm lazy and just use regular tap water. I'd open up a new bottle of water if I'm really feeling fancy. You can get a [squeeze bottle](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mini-Squeeze-Bottles-Pkg-6-Ounces/dp/B003LARSAQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423995980&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=squeeze+bottle) if you're feeling fancy, but really tap water spooned from a clean glass will do. 

I prefer [vegetable glycerin](http://www.amazon.co.uk/100%25-Pure-Vegetable-Glycerin-250ml/dp/B007NI5AKW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423998750&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=vegetable+glycerin); substituting aloe vera or even snail gel for some of the glycerin is supposed to be good, too. 

Purchase [amber or blue glass bottles] (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Moulded-Amber-Dropper-Bottle-single/dp/B00AJK8EG8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423998705&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=amber+glass+bottle) to keep out light! And make sure to keep it in a dark drawer or pouch. Refrigeration won't do you much good if people are opening the door many times a day. A two ounce, or 60ml bottle is ideal for body application, but I can't find it on Amazon UK. I wouldn't go for the 100ml bottle because that might speed up oxidization. 

**Directions:**(Proportions of ingredients coming below.) 
Use same spoon for consistent measurement. First add powder into a clean glass. I recommend clear glass so you can tell if the mixture is even.

Then spoon in the proportion of *cool* water that you want. Vigorously stir the mixture (frisking might add to oxygenation I think). In a few minutes, you should reach a saturation point at which the cloudy mixture suddenly turn **completely** clear, as in it looks like slightly thicker water. If it's remotely questionable that there are particles left, add another spoon or two of water and repeat. 

Next add in desired vegetable glycerin and stir until smooth (hold up to the light and make sure no swirls of uneven glycerin.) 

**Proportions:**
Below uses the max ratio of glycerin (or glycerin substitute) I've been able to add--any less water and the powder won't completely dissolve, any more glycerin will get uncomfortably sticky.

For a 5% moisturizing vitamin c serum:
1 part powder: 8 parts water: 11 parts glycerin

For a 10% moisturizing vitamin c serum:
1 part powder: 4 parts water: 5 parts glycerin 

For a 15% moisturizing vitamin c serum:
3 parts powder: 10 parts water: 7 parts glycerin

You can play around with water, glycerin, aloe vera, snail gel proportions for the none-powder parts. Obviously, all substitutes must be water soluble. Simply stick with 1 part powder to 9 part liquid rule for 10% strength and never go past 20% powder. Start with 5% if you're unsure how much your skin can handle. 

**usage**: shake before use as the glycerin settles. This is not oil soluble, so make you thoroughly wipe off oil after OCM, then do BHA exfoliation (which is oil soluble) before applying. This serum works best at a higher ph, so you might want to leave on for 20 minutes before the next layer. Goes on well under physical sunscreen and doesn't contribute too much to white cast. 

**storage**
The key is not to refrigerate, but to keep it in a pouch or drawer in complete darkness. I make a fresh batch every month, but once I forgot a bottle in the downstairs bathroom and it remained crystal clear over two hot summer months in the southern United States. 

**stain alert** if you're going to use it all over your body, this might stain your white sheets and white pajamas yellow. This has only happened to me once, but it turns out that I was doing OCM all over my body, and the mineral oil was preventing the serum from absorbing.

Anyway, why are people complaining about the story being 'unsubstantiated'?  Mark Taylor told his local paper the party had asked him to stand aside so Hargreaves could stand.  That's fact, not conjecture.  The party denied it, also fact.  The stupid shit Hargreaves has come out with is also a matter of public record.  None of this is stuff that's been invented by a liberal conspiracy or the biased mainstream media.

It may lead to speculation that Hargreaves had indeed been selected by the local party, but then the national leadership of UKIP saw the kind of nonsense he comes out with and went ""Oh Christ, Amjad Bashir mk II"" and made them backpeddle.

**Price of product:** £23 for 25ml

**Where did you purchase:** MooGoo website

**Product claims:** *""This serum is based around an oil soluble form of Vitamin C called ""Abscorbyl Tetraisopalmitate"" or VCIP. Most forms of Vitamin C are water soluble. Because the skin is protected by a layer of oil, this means that water soluble Vitamin C does not penetrate well. However our Vitamin C dissolves in oil and so can be absorbed deeper into the skin.*

*VCIP at this concentration is especially good for pigmentation and sun damage. For this reason, we recommend it pigmentation around the eye area or other areas of the face where pigmentation is a problem.*

*VCIP is a very expensive ingredient. We have done our best to keep this serum as affordable as possible. After comparing other serums with a similar amount of VCIP, we think you will be happy you found us.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because it's such a simple formula, high percentage of actives, large size for an eye serum.

**Your opinion:**

Nothing wrong with asking a simple question. I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings.

Why? In South Africa the campaign of civil disobedience went on for 50 years before anything was achieved.Did they not have the right to fight for freedom? Again, violence was a key factor in bringing the government to the negotiating table.

What about the Syrians? Do they have a right to fight to overthrow their dictator? I guess they should just ask him  nicely.

Really? Why do you think I asked the question?

For a start, Westminster got involved, forcing the government to make changes. They ignored the civil rights movement, completely.  It was the violence and the violence alone that made them turn their eye across the sea.

**Price of product:** ~90p for three 1ml samples

**Where did you purchase:** Paula's Choice

**Product claims:** *""Anti-ageing without the shine. Use this serum to normalise oily skin and fight the signs of ageing. Tones down redness, too.*

- *Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C protect while fighting the signs of ageing*

- *Weightless, silky serum spreads easily, dries shine-free*

- *100% fragrance- and colorant-free.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as part of the PC Resist sample pack.

**Your opinion:** A meh formula, too many filler ingredients. A missed opportunity to create a silicone-free product, PC seem to put silicones in absolutely everything.

By far the nicest texture of all the PC antioxidant serums, light yellow colour. Not too greasy, not too dry, not too thick or thin. However PC say this serum has been reformulated from yellow to nearly clear, does this mean the coenzyme Q10 has been reduced?

It is a shame PC don't reveal the percentage of vitamin C as they do with retinol, the full size is too expensive to recommend without that.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, cyclopentasiloxane, butylene glycol, glycerin, dimethicone, polysilicone-11, polysorbate 20, lauryl PEG-9 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, hyaluronic acid, resveratrol, niacinamide, quercetin, adenoside, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, vitamin E, phospholipids, coenzyme Q10, epigallocatechin gallate, sea whip extract, bisabolol, beta glucan, phytic acid, xanthan gum, acrylates/ C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, sodium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin.""* ",null,0,null,1424007513,null,0,1424007695,0,com3bd2,null,t3_2vvj7h,null,t1_com3bd2,null,t1_col9jau,null,null,null,1424602971,null,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null
