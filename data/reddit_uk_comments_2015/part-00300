There's a paper from the BWEA which estimates capital cost for offshore wind as between £2400 and £3500 / kW capacity.

http://www.gl-garradhassan.com/assets/downloads/UK_Offshore_Wind_Charting_the_Right_Course.pdf

In comparison, HPC has been given a provisional capex cost of £5000 / kW. (£16 billion for 3200 MW).

When adjusted for capacity factor - for wind 35% and nuclear baseload 90%, then these work out at £6,900 / kW adj for wind and £5,600 for nuclear baseload.

Due to discount rates, we can mostly ignore the lifespan of both types of generation (30 years for wind, 60 for nuclear). There are also small savings in maintenance and fuelling for reducing nuclear output, but they can also be ignored.

In terms of ramp performance for current nuclear plants, then designers aim for unlimited adjustment of 2.5% per minute between 70 and 100% power. Deeper or faster ramping (e.g. from 25% to 100% at 5% per minute) is subject to restrictions, typically around 400 such ramping operations per year (once up and down per weekday), to avoid metal fatigue due to temperature/pressure changes. Some plants (e.g. the ABWR) have an emergency ramp-up facility, and can go from 70% power to 100% power in under 30 seconds, in the event of a serious grid problem.

Cold starts take considerably longer, but with the ability to ramp down to 25%, they should be uncommon.

Hello everyone. 

I'm in the process of building a beasty PC and there are several components from my previous (LAN orientated) PC I built 2 years ago.


BitFenix Prodigy Mini-ITX Cube Case - Magma Orange


AMD APU A10 6800K Black Edition 4.4GHz 


MSI GTX 760 2GB GDDR5


Gigabyte GA-F2A85XN-WIFI


All are used in good condition only issue being the Gigabyte motherboard doesn't have the WIFI adapter. 

I'm happy to sell the components individually or together, built and usable (if you add RAM &amp; your SSD/HDD) as a working PC - this includes a semi-modular PSU for free and the of course the fans. 

I'm open to price, I originally spent £400 and recognise it devalues.

Thanks!

100% check out local pubs, personally my favourite is The Finborogh Arms ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/ul7Zy)). Chelsea pubs have a brilliant atmosphere, especially before/after games. I also love buying chips (fries) from the local stalls, they taste so good!

Definitely buy a souvenir (match program, shirt, scarf, whatever) because the first game is memorable as fuck and you'll be amazed by everything.

null,null,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,null,"Negative equity works like this:

I buy a house for £100,000. 

I put down a £10,000 deposit. 

The house is worth £100,000 and I own 10% of it outright. 

This means I need to get a mortgage for the other 90%. This means I have a LTV (Loan to Value) of 90%. 

Now, 90% LTV mortgages are plentiful and they have okay rates. 3-5% APR, generally.  

Mortgages have something called and 'initial period'. It's basically the length they expect you to keep the mortgage.. For ease of explanation, lets say I get a fixed rate mortgage with an initial period of 3.5% APR for 3 years, then 5% APR after that. 

Now, negative equity happens when my house price falls. Lets say it goes from being worth £100,000 to £90,000. My equity in the house is all gone, so when my initial period ends with my mortgage I will need to look for a new mortgage with a 100% LTV. These mortgages are much more rare and harder to get. If I can't get a new deal, I have to stay on my old mortgage after the initial period ends and my APR will go up to 5%. 

That means my mortgage will be costing me £112.50 more per month. 

It gets even worse if you're looking at 110% LTV or worse, as literally no one will lend to you nowadays if you're that far into negative equity. You're completely at the whim of what rate your current lender feels like giving you. 

Often they're linked to a base rate, which means it's x% + y% where x% was agreed when you signed the mortgage and y% can pretty much be whatever the fuck the bank feels like. Often it's linked to the bank of england base rate. 

So if the bank of england base rate starts climbing, so will your mortgage payments. 

So yeah. Negative equity is an absolute shit, and it will trap you. You can get to the point where the bank won't even let you sell your house because you'll owe them £xx,xxx even after you've sold.

I hate to say it and invariably I'll get downvoted for going against the liberal grain around here but that's the downside of democracy. You don't really decide an awful lot, most if it's just talking about it. There's too many idiots with a voice. In a perfect scenario, we'd have experts in every cabinet position and a prime minister who was a good man-manager to tie them all together. Then everyone makes the decisions that need to be made. Of course, consultation takes place but at the end of the day a decision gets made and the person who made it is responsible for it.

But that's not democracy really. At least not the version we have and people tug for. One's ability to simply choose is regarded as the be all and end all. It doesn't matter if one's choice is actually making any sort of positive effect.

Edit:  From here: http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/International-Students/Fees--finance/Home-or-Overseas-fees/Scotland-Higher-Education/#1:-Those-who-have-a-'relevant-connection'-to-Scotland

1: Those who have a 'relevant connection' to Scotland

In order to qualify for ‘home’ fees under this category, you must meet all of the following criteria:

(a) you must be settled in the UK on the relevant date; and

(b) you must be ordinarily resident in Scotland on the relevant date. However, if you are ordinarily resident in Scotland because you moved from elsewhere in the UK and Islands to undertake a course, then you are considered to be ordinarily resident wherever you moved from; and

(c) your ordinary residence in Scotland on the relevant date must not be attributable to / connected with any period of residence in Scotland that was wholly/mainly for the purpose of receiving full-time education within the immediately preceding three-year period; if it is, then you will not be eligible under this category unless you acquired the right of permanent residence in the UK ""as a result of residence for full-time education which has led to"" this right; and

(d) you must also have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for the full three year period before the relevant date, eg if your course begins in October 2015, the date in (a) above will be 1 August 2015 and you must have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2015; and

(e) the main purpose for your residence in the UK and Islands must not have been to receive full-time education during any part of that three-year period. However, if you have the right of permanent residence you are excluded from this 'main purpose' test, as long as you were ordinarily resident in the EEA and/or Switzerland immediately prior to the five-year period of UK residence which led to you obtaining this right.
------------------
a) and b) seem most relevant.

a) Requires residency in the UK, b) requires residency in Scotland on the relevant date.

b) States if you are in Scotland solely for education, then you are considered resident where you came from.

It seems to follow if the reason you moved to Scotland was due to another reason, such as work; then you do not have to have a full 3 years residency in Scotland.  Just 3 years in the UK + Residency in Scotland on the relevant date for reasons other than full-time education.",null,0,null,1438720604,null,null,1438721060,0,ctris07,null,t3_3fpvda,null,null,null,t1_ctriblo,null,null,null,1440281554,null,0,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

null,null,CountChukka,null,null,null,"I've been going through something like this myself the past year (see my other post), and my understanding is that a 1975 Act claim can only succeed if the claimant is what one might genuinely consider ""needy"".

IxionS3 refers to ""dependent adult"". I usually refer to the 1975 act as a ""the widows and orphans act"" when explaining the situation to my friends.

Unless the sons are children, disabled or on benefits I think they're unlikely to prevail under the 1975 Act.

That you say the sons have their own businesses and appear successful (although for all you know they may have debts) suggests they don't have much chance.

If you're the executor then you're only responsible to the estate and its beneficiaries - i.e. what gran wanted - and you have quite a bit of latitude. 

Assuming you're the executor (and until your solicitor tells you otherwise), you're free to handle this as you like - you don't have to show them the will if you don't want to.

Assuming you're the executor, you don't have to tell them anything - you don't have to tell them what's in the will, or who's being left money. You can just ignore them, or tell them ""I'm just doing what gran wanted, and I don't have to discuss it with you"".

The sons will be able to get a copy of their will by having their solicitor write to the solicitors that made the will (called a ""Larke v Neugus"" letter) but it'll cost them a few hundred quid.

Anything in writing should be done via your solicitor, obviously, and you should take your solicitor's advice. But if they confront you face to face then you're allowed to fib and say ""I'd love to give you a copy of the will, but I need your request in writing to my solicitor"" or ""my solicitor says I'm not allowed to show you, you have to get your solicitor to request it"".

My instinct would be to take this line and just stick with it - be smiling and friendly but helpless, ""I'm really sorry, I'd love to help you, but I'm not allowed to - just get a solicitor and we can sort it out"". You can say things like ""it's not up to me, is it? it's up to the solicitors"" and ""I can't help what's in the will"".

This creates the barrier that they have to pay money before they can see what's in the will, and they have go to a solicitor who should tell them how slim their chances are. On the other hand, spending money on seeing the will may make them emotionally invested in the idea of challenging it. Showing them the will will save them some money and may allow their solicitor to say more firmly ""I'm not optimistic about this case"" (a solicitor will never say anything as clear and solid as ""you've got no hope, mate""). You're allowed to show them the will if you want to.

I'm not a solicitor, and I don't know for sure what your solicitor will advise. You should ask them. I would suspect they'll tell you ""don't tell the sons anything"", because solicitors seem like poker players, never revealing anything to the other side unless it's part of a gambit. On the other hand, they don't have to put up with the hassle, harassment and verbal abuse from your uncle(s).

Your gran could have left one third each to son A and son B, and one sixth each to her two grandchildren by daughter C. I don't think she had to do it this way to ensure C's children weren't left out. It was her choice to leave it directly to the grandchildren, but I think it was a good decision. If any children are under 18 you may be able to pay the funds into a child trust fund or junior ISA to protect them from their parents.

Do not allow yourself to be bullied. That is why solicitors, although expensive, can be very helpful - they help insulate you from the anger of emotional family members.

The star player this season for me will be the little magician David Silva. It looks as though he'll be played off Aguero/Bony this year which will suit him to a tee. With the pace of sterling stretching the opposition and providing him with more space I can see him having a brilliant year. 

I also think Mangala will have a good year and show everyone why we paid 32 million for him. We saw glimpses last year when he was paired with MdM and they formed a great partnership at the back. I just hope Vinnie can finally click with him.

**Username:** /u/josh_fraser17        
**Original Post:**          
Im selling my amazing CPU cooler - the Dark Rock Pro 2 from Be Quiet. 
This cooler is amazing with a great ratio of sound to performance. 

It comes with all the included mounting hardware, the cooler itself, 1 x 120mm and 1 x 135mm Silent Wings fan and instructions. All in original box. 
At max speed this cooler only gives of a sound level of 26.4 dB which is pretty much silence. 

Cooler is near new condition as it hasnt really been used that long. 
Can achieve amazing OC with it whilst still having a silent system. 

Grab an amazing cooler at a great price!

Price - £40 plus postage (will work out at the time)

I'm optimistic, a change away from the stale 4-4-2 to a 4-2-3-1 (or a 4-3-3 depending on what works best) will help a lot to begin with. Man United and Arsenal have strengthened a bit, but I still believe in at least a top 2 finish. As far as CL I think we're all hoping to finally reach that elusive quarter-final.

&gt;Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

Aguero as always, on his day he's unplayable, as long as he can remain injury free he'll be our greatest asset. Can't forget Silva either, his enormous contributions to our success is often overlooked by non-City fans.

&gt;How do you think the team will line up?

4-2-3-1:

Hart

Zabaleta-Kompany-Mangala-Clichy

Touré-Fernandinho

Sterling-Silva-Nasri

As for CM. Yes that's a problem but not as big as many people think. Dinho will definitely be vital for us and I think Fernando will surprise many. He looked good in pre-season and has said that a groin problem was holding him back. I fully believe he can find his old form back. The way he played in Porto. Yaya might need some cover as he's aging and all. Nasri is capaple but inconsistant. We also have Delph and Zuculini could cover for him as well. I'm not saying that our midfield is flawless but I think that is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.



I agree with most that LB is a maaajor issue and we need that sorted out. I really don't understand why we haven't signed Alex Sandro. That kid is talent. He has the aggression of Kolorov and defensive ability of Clichy. He is a great balance and only 21! That is a signing we surely need and we should focus on getting soon as he has been linked with Juventus for some time.

&gt;First, it’s really important to understand that the austerity policies of the current government are not, as much of the British press portrays them, the only responsible answer to a fiscal crisis. There is no fiscal crisis, except in the imagination of Britain’s Very Serious People; the policies had large costs; the economic upturn when the UK fiscal tightening was put on hold does not justify the previous costs. More than that, the whole austerian ideology is based on fantasy economics, while it’s actually the anti-austerians who are basing their views on the best evidence from modern macroeconomic theory and evidence.

&gt;Nonetheless, all the contenders for Labour leadership other than Mr. Corbyn have chosen to accept the austerian ideology in full, including accepting false claims that Labour was fiscally irresponsible and that this irresponsibility caused the crisis. As Simon Wren-Lewis says, when Labour supporters reject this move, they aren’t “moving left”, they’re refusing to follow a party elite that has decided to move sharply to the right.

Every month you are repaid both principle (investment) and capital (edit - no, i meant interest) into your account on Fundingcircle.  Repayments continue over the term of the loan - over that period you'll get all the capital repaid in equal small chunks and interest on top. 

You can either invest manually or auto-invest based on rules (there are 6 basic credit ratings,and you specify your minimum required interest rate and which credit ratings you find acceptable - I have mine set to auto invest at 12% on B-rated loans, 10% on A-rated, 9 % on A+ rated - currently making average 10.8% before tax)

If you accept the far higher risks of E-rated loans, 20% interest is available. I pass over that sort of risk...

Investing manually takes time. Autobid automatic investing will use all your returns to buy new loan parts if enabled.

To get an income from Fundingcircle you'd have to have autoinvest turned off for a period every month (to accumulate repayable cash in your account), then send yourself a transfer to your own bank, then turn autoinvest on again. It would only be a few minutes work twice every month

Congrats on the job, I live in Reigate, approximately 3 miles away, but not the nearest town main town which is Redhill.

&gt;I had some questions for you to answer, if you didn't mind:

&gt;- Where can I find cheap but quality accomodations near Hospital?

You mean where should you live, or what websites etc can you use to find a place? Personally, Reigate is a great place to live. 

- What is your opinion of East Surrey Hospital, particulartly the Surgery ward?

I have had some experience of East Surrey Hospital, which were not particularly good, however that was more around maternity, antenatal care and A&amp;E. It's had an overhaul in the past year or so, so it's less dingy! Will you definitely be based at East Surrey or maybe also Horsham or wherever the other one is? 

- Are there any vegetarian restaurants or restaurants that serve vegetarian meals?

Restaurants which cater for Vegetarians are quite common in the UK, and food is generally marked as Vegetarian on the menu. Check out [this site](http://www.veggieplaces.co.uk/search_results.php?s_loc=Redhill&amp;s_code=RH1) for local ones. 

- Are there any places where I can run freely?

There are plenty of free areas to run. Lots of parks within the vicinity, Reigate Priory Park is voted on of the best in the county and is great for running in. There is Earlswood Common and Redhill has a park. But you can quite easily run along the footpaths if that suits you. There are running clubs dotted around too. 

- Is food cheap there?

To buy or eat out? Eating out can be expensive, but I'm not really sure what to compare it against where you're coming from. Food prices in general really depend where you shop, and what you think is cheap! Going to larger supermarkets you're going to find cheaper food, but usually worse quality.

- What's the local football and basketball club?

No idea about Basketball, for football there are probably local clubs, are you looking to watch or play?

- Are there any places/amateur leagues to play basketball?

No idea, sorry.

- Any comic book shops?

Not that I'm aware of, but not my scene, there is a shop in Reigate (Miwk) which sells some but not much.

- What is the nightlife like?

We are using an LG G3 running copilot premium (with full Europe maps) alongside a windows 7 PC with Itnconv and Google maps.

Our process is pretty simple, using Google maps we put in our start point and destination, and then drag and drop the route until we are happy.

We then use the export route link to paste into ITNconv (using the same settings as Google maps).

Then we go through the route adding in additional waypoints to ensure that even with recalculating on copilot we end up following the same roads.

Use ITNconv to save the route as a .trip file.

Transfer to the phone is handled using Google drive and es file explorer, we place the .trp files in /sdcard/co.alk.copilot.mapviewer/EU/save

Routes can then be loaded in copilot.

Fits a little bit of a work around, but our recent tests locally have demonstrated it is very functional.

null,null,going_dicey,eng-durham,london,null,"House prices don't make sense for a lot of BTL in the South atm; particularly throughout London and the surrounding Home Counties. BTL is exceedingly attractive in areas throughout the North where property prices haven't been as crazy and in some cases have been stagnant or dipped. For example, some LL's up North are seeing 10% yields.  Conversely, top yields atm in dodgy bits of London (which provide better yields than nicer areas) are circa 3% gross (yup, same as your run of the mill Santander 123 account). Many new LL's who buy without doing their full research are negative.

In fact, its quite easy to see why this would be the case if you do a quick search on Zoopla. Do a search for a property that's for sale and find an equivalent for rent. Divide the total annual rent by the total sale price and that's your gross yield. Now subtract out acquisition costs (SDLT, survey fees, mortgage arrangement, higher BTL interest rates, conveyancer fees, etc), then subtract out void periods (at least one month per year is reasonable), cost of maintenance, management fees, etc. Couple this with the new tax changes, and BTL (in hotspot locations) makes absolutely no financial sense. You are 100% relying on capital value increases. Sure, it seems like London property (as an example) is 'super hot' and there's 'no way not to make money'! But in reality, average London prices were only up 4% last year (http://data.london.gov.uk/housingmarket/). 

In effect, the areas where BTL is most lucrative remain quite 'cheap' in terms of housing cost/value. The problem is most first time BTL'ers with 1 or 2 properties don't understand the full outlay and will just buy in hotspots. This pushes up prices, puts these LL's negatives, sucks supply and further prices out FTB'ers.

null,null,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"I completely agree with you... it's been the scourge of our play since AVB, and was only ever solved briefly by Tactics Tim, funnily enough.

Basically, both AVB and Poch are tactical ideologues with very rigid ideas about how they like to play.  Playing a 4-2-3-1 works best when you've got an attacking band of three who interplay very well and move fluidly around the pitch.  Instead, we stick with inverted wingers who are entirely predictable in their movement.  Instead of exploiting the potential to swap positions, they all just drift into the same areas, with only the fullbacks offering any width.

We also have a problem that none of those three players make darting runs from deep.  We lack pace in that band, plus a truly outstanding passer in the mould of a Mata, Silva or Iniesta to find players with unconventional balls.  So what happens is that we rarely ever see Eriksen, Chadli or Lamela/Townsend as the furthest player up the pitch.  Even when Kane drops deep to collect the ball (which he does fairly often), players don't make counter-balancing runs into the spaces he's just vacated.  Instead everyone drops deep to pick the ball up off each other.

All this leads to problems all across the pitch - fullbacks get forced too far up and leave gaps down the wings; possession becomes predictable and easy to dispossess us or contain; too many shots get taken from outside the box with low percentage success rates due to frustration.

It's hard to know what the best way to fix it is.  I would argue that some pace on the wings and playing with uninverted wingers could be a big step.  Get quick players to break in behind the line of defence and get to the byline to cross.  But I feel like Poch isn't open to that at all, which is a shame.

We've in some ways been unlucky in that we've had outstanding individual attacking players in recent seasons (Bale, Eriksen, Kane) who have been able to strike from nothing, masking a lot of our attacking stagnancy and preventing the manager from truly evolving his play.  Without Kane's wonder season, Poch would've been forced to do something drastically different or risk losing his job, because we currently have the attacking cohesiveness of a mid-table side at best.",null,0,null,1438726786,null,null,false,0,ctrmud5,null,t3_3fsh5l,null,null,null,t3_3fsh5l,null,null,null,1440283535,null,8,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,8,null

But I don't think the tags on Chicharito and Mirallas are out of whack. We are in rather desperate need for a striker. Problem with that is at least half of the clubs in the league are in the same boat. We shouldn't be dicking around with that.

As for the Daves, I think that one could make a compelling argument that they've been somewhat free spending in the first half of the transfer window. We spent decent money on a fair few players who may or may not be of the standard we need. Aside from Payet, we don't really know whether the rest of th players that have come in will pay off like last summer's crop. I'm not saying they won't. I'm saying there simply isn't any data to prove things one way or another. That in mind, I'd say the Daves changed their spending habits quite drastically from May to July. And since our manager and our players are mostly unknown entities in the context of this league, I don't think it's possible to pin us to any position in the table. It wouldn't surprise me if we finished 7th. It wouldn't surprise me if we finished 17th.

Lastly, I've said it before and I'll say it once more, I don't do doom and gloom. I'm afraid that's rubbish. I've followed this club for forty something years, and sometimes you get that queazy feeling in the pit of your stomach. I'm not saying we're doomed. I'm saying there are a lot of things that need to come together quickly which is very difficult to do. This will be the most difficult league in years because even the little clubs are spending money. I reckon any club from 8th or 9th down could be in danger. Therefore, I think we've got a tricky season ahead and we're not as set as I'd like us to be. Queazy. Not doomed.

One other thing, and I haven't been paying attention enough to know if this is a popular or unpopular opinion, but if he becomes leader of the opposition then imo the press will have a field day with him just as they did with Ed, based on his looks. Andy does not photograph well, that *should* not matter I know, but we have increasingly US styled politics with all the associated image management, and Andy looks like he's at best upset and at worst on the verge of tears in the pictures I've seen. He actually quite reminds me of John Boehner (US Republican), his facial expression is similar. 

The press will go all out to get the absolute worst images of him, and if the 2020 election is Andy vs Boris it really could go either way on who's the oddest looking.

This is exactly the kind of attitude I'd prefer to keep out of /r/BritishPolitics. 

The notion that, somehow, legitimate discussion of ""the left"" is solely the preserve of supporters of the Labour Party and fringe Left has been cropping up all over the British political subs lately, and it's entirely contrary to the spirit of what this kind of forum is about. We're here to discuss politics and current affairs in a civil, *open* arena- that means, inevitably, people coming into contact with positions that they disagree with. I'm not the only one who's been leapt upon for daring to have an opinion on Jeremy Corbyn without clutching a Labour membership card to my chest as I type every word- it's genuinely putting people away from discussing the topic at all, and that's *exactly* what the mod team is here to stop.

The entire point of the exhaustive rules we drew up upon this subreddit's foundation was to facilitate that without letting it descend into an echo-chamber like /r/ukpolitics was becoming at the time we split off. Shutting down debate by citing at the political position of the person making it is absolutely not something we look kindly on. 

&gt;I fear your behaviour interferes with the natural flow of the subreddit, please step back a smidgen, one gets the sense, rightly or wrongly, you are trying to dominate and direct the discussion.

...Posting a scattering of Dan Hodges articles constitutes ""interference with the natural flow of the subreddit""? 

The reason the moderation team submits articles at such a pace is to keep the front page both moving and current. We've done it for upward of a full year now- we all post sources from every corner of the spectrum, without flooding it excessively with a single point of view. Without some nudging along, the subreddit isn't yet at a size capable of sustaining itself as an active community - without topics to discuss there in the first place, people simply don't visit. 

I've been submitting a spread of pro-Corbyn and anti-Corbyn articles over the past few weeks. You're welcome to dig through my submission history and examine it, if you must insist on making a fuss about it. 

If the front page is at a point where it's completely flooded with pro-Corbyn posts, we'll post some links that take other positions. That's exactly the same kind of thing we've done in every single case where a heavily-hyped political topic has threatened to overwhelm the board- we've had a large number of complaints from our centre/right-leaning users that the place threatens, at times, to become an echo chamber, and, frankly, it's our job to do something about that. 

If you'd like to discuss this further, I do recommend that you take it to [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBritishPolitics), so the rest of the moderation team can have their say.

Yeah, i'm missing the point. That clearly isn't about the journalist at all, clearly some very honest journalist who just happens to be making themselves part of the story. The implications made here - that the police are still actively stopping anyone who happens to be looking round these would be huge - but deserve rightful skepticism from someone with this persons track record. I really don't see how that's a problem?  

Edward Heath may well have done some terrible things and hopefully some investigations will tell us, but I really don't see how engaging in this peadogeddon mentality is a healthy attitude at all either, nor do I think being delirious about some sort of Streisand effect on people who may well be innocent is at all an appropriate thing to do either.

Personally, I agree with the principle that loss-making mines had to be closed. The problem at that time was the unions were opposed to *any* mines being closed, and this opposition hardened Thatcher to cruelty. 

The ideal solution would have been for the unions to have accepted the closure of genuinely loss-making mines and negotiated for the best early retirement, relocation and retraining deals for their membership. By the end of it, Thatcher hated them all for their resistance that she was content to let mining towns rot.

But assuming you were a miner at the time, opposed to losing your job, striking made some sense - you'd have reason to be aggrieved if the other side cheated (which the government almost certainly did to some extent).

null,null,hampa9,null,null,null,"&gt; Why anybody would want to cycle on the roads today with pricks like that around I don't know.

Sadly, they don't. There are cities in the Netherlands with a cycling rate that exceeds 40% (Groningen is 60%). The social and environmental impact of taking half the cars off the road is enormous. Less air pollution, less noise, less space used on the road so everyone can get around faster, less space taken up in general by vehicles not used for 95% of the day, kids can safely play on the streets and get to know their neighbours, buses can take faster more direct routes by having bus stops further from residential areas (because now people can cycle the mile to the stop).

For the UK, it's something like 2%, and our solution is to paint lines onto the side of the road that are sometimes even less safe to use than the main lane. It'll never work. People do not want to cycle near cars, especially women and children, and all the ad campaigns in the world won't fool them that it's a good idea. We need completely separate infrastructure.

People whinge about cyclists holding them up, but if we had mass cycling we would have far less congestion, and many residential roads that are now effectively one-lane (because of all the [cars parked on the side,](http://garagewire.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/RAC-highlight-parking-problems-in-UK-cities.jpg) blocking pedestrians, again taking up huge amounts of space when the cars are not used the vast majority of the time) could become two lane, allowing cars to pass each other.

However, without the context, without the 15 year story, it's impossible to fathom just how much it meant. My first season as a fan was the 98/99 season, I was 6 when it started, a naive child with outlandish ideas as to how far my club could go, it started on a high (obviously) with that first promotion, it got better the next season with a consecutive promotion. For these first two years as a fan I was able to keep the taunts of my friends at bay, they were alł Leicester fans In the O'neill era, the winning helped me move past it. The few seasons after that were awful for me as a fan, up and down, lower table fodder for every team to beat, with age came a little experience and I finally realised that my dreams of reaching the summit of English football, of finally getting that one up on the rags was never going to happen. Cue a decade of pessimism (the older fans will have suffered this for far longer than I). The mentality of 'typical City' stuck, and still does to an extent, it's a hard habit to shake. The first takeover happened, the second takeover happened, we rose up the table, we won the FA Cup, but the thought of us getting the big one still never really entered my thoughts, and if it did was quickly dismissed as 'never going to happen.' Then it did, as if from nowhere, in the most difficult of fashions, as is the City way. A 15 year journey epitomised in one game, the ups, the downs, the pessimism, and then something happened that City fans hadn't really experienced, it ended on a high note. The forgotten dream of a young child came true in the most dramatic way possible and a decade of emotions that I'd forgotten existed came out all in one go. Sorry for wall of text, but that video just bought it all up again, the love. I don't love many things, or many people, but one thing that I will always love is City. People come and go, so do places and ideas, but City is that constant, it's obscene really just how much this club means to me, even though for a long time it was torture, Aguero made it worth it.

His best form for us has been as a CM in 13/14 and on the side of a front three this past season. Even then, as a ""forward"", he was dropping deep and filling quite a few of the same spaces he would have as a CM.

I don't really disagree with you though. Like you said, Coutinho can be great as a 10 if he has quality players in front of him. It's not near as much an issue in a 4-3-3 as in a 4-4-2 diamond also, as that's more of a creative role which can skew deeper (especially with midfielders as dynamic as Henderson and Milner) instead of spearheading the attack as basically a forward like we saw in 13/14 with Sterling.",null,0,null,1438731379,null,null,false,0,ctrpkn0,null,t3_3fss0s,null,null,null,t1_ctrmyuc,null,null,null,1440284822,null,10,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10,null

The logic doesn't work does it?

Did anyone from the actual university officially and explicitly say they were doing sign ins because people were never attending university? 

I suspect it's more to do with monitoring the people who pay large sums of money to attend your university which isn't subsidised by the government in any way, and you need to make sure that they actually cough up the cash. It's also that if they fail their exams it affects the university's performance measures.

In 2014 there were 290,000 immigrants from non-EU countries (the only countries that would require a student visa).

In the same year there were approx. 395,000 overseas students in the UK.

There is absolutely no way the percentage of people overstaying on student visas is high enough to be the majority of the 290,000 immigrants. 

In 2012 the Guardian ran a piece that said:

""One senior manager informed us that at the time of the inspection there were potentially 26,000 students whose leave should have been curtailed and who should have had enforcement action taken against them.""

That means at the MOST it's 15% of students overstay on their visas. At MOST. That also doesn't account for the fact that is 26,000 students to date, whereas the 390,000 figure is the number of student visas in place in 2014. 

When you consider this is 26,000 students out of the hundreds of thousands a year that enter the country, it is probably far lower than 15%.

The likelihood is that since 2012 universities now have to demonstrate they take steps to ensure people stick to their visa rules and that has spurred them onto things like registers.",null,0,null,1438731518,null,null,false,0,ctrpnhl,null,t3_3fdkgl,null,null,null,t1_ctrnnmm,null,null,null,1440284858,null,1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

They go to special schools, which are priced specifically to exclude all but the very richest, in order to teach their kids from the youngest age that they're the ruling class, entitled to rule, born from superior stock. They make connections and friendships at these places which form the basis of the political leadership of the country. You think it's a co-incidence for example that the man whom George Osborne sold Royal Mail too was best man at his wedding? They're comrades, helping each other out! Solidarity. I'm a trade unionist and have been for many years I recognise class solidarity when it appears. This current government has more Etonians in it than any previous Conservative government. What is Eton if not a training school for the political and cultural elite? What are Oxford and Cambridge if not finishing schools for the ruling class? Do you know that during the Cold War the Russians found Britain the easiest country to infiltrate with spies since all you needed was a public school background, a degree from Oxbridge, and a posh accent, and you'd be trusted implicitly!

The idea that they're ""just people"" and they don't think and act in class terms is tremendously naive. They share interests and they work together to achieve them. They have conflicts, of course, but by and large they can be relied upon to think of the bigger picture. 

In Britain the rich are the most class conscious people there are, more so than any marxist or trade unionist. This goes back centuries. It's not a new thing and it's not something controversial either. I've been involved in politics for years and I assure you we live in a society with a very strong establishment, deep state, ruling class, call it what you want. I like the word they use in Spain - *La casta* ie the Ruling Caste, I think that's quite apt.

null,null,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; Why would it always be ""damaging to the UK as a whole""?

Because a large-scale devaluation would push a lot of people into negative equity. This has a direct correlation with consumer spending (depreciating house prices were part of the drop off in economic activity during the credit crunch), meaning there's a real chance of a recession. In addition, with so many people being pushed into negative equity, the banks find themselves in a precarious position, in that their mortgage portfolios drop hugely in value, and they have less deposits on hand than they thought they did. This means that, for the first time buyer you mentioned, the deposits demanded will be very high to counter this huge drop in equity. In addition, homeowners facing negative equity will not be keen to cement their negative balance by selling their house (and therefore find themselves with no deposit to buy a new one/rent a place, as well as having a huge mortgage bill at the end to pay) so those houses aren't even on the market.

In fact, the only people who would benefit are those with enough cash on hand to buy a property outright (or at the very least, with huge deposits to put down), and most of these folks will be BTL landlords.

null,null,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; My parents financial advisor is coming round soon to have a chat with me and my sister about it all.

Are you paying him for his time?

I believe things have been cleared up recently, but it's important to be sure he's an *independent* financial advisor and not commission based in any way. In the 00's there were some dreadful commission-based sharks who were allowed to call themselves IFAs.

Personally I think that ""getting on the property ladder when I finish uni"" is a dubious goal. It's buying into the British [property ownership doctrine](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-27/fallacy-homeownership-–-why-do-people-believe-myth) when, at age 18 or so, you're probably going to spend a bit of time yet considering your place in the world (and maybe trying to change it).

The assumption might be that, after uni, you're going to get a job in your field somewhere in the UK, maybe within an hour or two of where you live now. Are you going to want to move in with a partner, have kids, or relocate for work? What if you hate your career or get made redundant in a couple of years? What if the best way to advance yourself is to take this job offer in another country?

Whilst you might dismiss all these questions today - or believe you have the answers - you don't know what might happen in the future. You might get settled in one city, and then have to move house because one of your parents gets ill, and you want to be closer to them.

If you stick this money in the bank, where it'll be safest, you won't get a very good return on it. If you stick this money in stock market trackers, then the market may have crashed when you want to buy a house in 10 years time (in which case we'd expect it to recover well within 20 or 30 years).

IMO you need to have a good think about this, and think extremely longterm. You should read lots before speaking to your financial advisor, so that you have lots of questions for him and can have a good discussion. You should find a financial advisor who understands you, and who's prepared to explore all your questions with you. Your parents should not be offended if you choose someone else.

How does this affect your student loans? Are you still eligible for them, or are you going to have to spend some of this money on food and rent the next 3 years?

null,null,EverythingIsFine,null,null,null,"I'll say two things about that. Firstly, it didn't and doesn't have to be the case where interest on bonds is paid in order for the government to finance itself, let alone that much. It was a political choice to make the government look like it ""funds itself"" via taxation and borrowing. The reality and the workings of the treasury/BOE is that the money is created and credited first. The government literally takes it from the BOE, spends it, then if there is a deficit, between what it has taken in taxes and what it has spent, it sells the amount of bonds to match that gap. This happens on a daily basis. Secondly, even though that is the case, those interest payments are made to the private sector, thus creating an exactly equal surplus to said deficit of the government (plus a little annuity for the bond holders as an income stream) If/when we move in to a government budget surplus, i.e, it takes in more from the private sector (taxation) than it spends, it will start taking away from the private sector surplus, as a whole, rather than giving, as it does now. If it gets to the point where the private sector, as a whole, can't just use cash on hand to pay for the government surplus, then it will have to borrow. That's not really ideal, especially when you take a look at private sector debt levels, and past history of what happens when it builds up too high, and a massive deleveraging occurs afterwards, which of course means that the government surplus will just be short lived as automatic stabilizers, bailouts or even QE kick in to stabilize the bust.

For example, a lot was made last season of Eriksen covering more ground than any other person.  The thing is, I don't think he should be that sort of player.  He's not Vidal, making lung busting runs from box-to-box, tackling ferociously and getting on the end of goalscoring chances.  He's a creator first and foremost, and so his movement should be based around finding space, not covering ground.  He should be instructed to play similar to how Silva plays for city... a free-ish role floating around and finding gaps wherever possible.

Asking him to press constantly is a low-yield usage of him I reckon.  I'm sure if you cross-compare how many kilometres he ran compared to how many tackles and interceptions he made, it wouldn't be hugely productive.  Pressing just ends up exhausting him to the point where he clearly can't function as effectively as a creator, which was painfully evident in the whole second half of last season.",null,0,null,1438737148,null,null,false,0,ctrszu7,null,t3_3fsh5l,null,null,null,t1_ctrrvk1,null,null,null,1440286499,null,2,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

null,null,TheAndies,null,null,null,"One of the problems is that police already deal with overflow from other services: social services, mental health units, paramedics... If they don't have enough people or time to deal with something, the police are the next stop. Social services are especially prone to this, Friday afternoon is a nightmare when social services start informing police about things that need to be dealt with over the weekend. 

Missing persons are incredibly work-intensive. Taking a report and doing the basic checks (hospitals, family members, friends etc.) can easily take most of a shift for one or two police officers. That's not unreasonable, but if the same person keeps going missing day after day (as happens with kids who don't like being in a children's home or being placed with a relative because their parents are unsuitable), then it builds up fast. 

As with the recent remarks about rethinking if police officers should attend burglaries, it's an issue with resources. With the cuts they're getting thinner on the ground, so there have to be considerations about how to use them.

Suarez may have only had 1.5 seasons of incredible football, but what he did in this two seasons makes me want to believe had he stayed we would always be serious title contenders, and that much can't be said about all of Gerrard's career. 

Gerrard has however gone to bring us silverware with a far lesser team including a Champions League. But I certainly believe it's easier to exceed expectations in tournaments than in a whole league second.

But the way I took the question, I don't consider consistency, season after season. I'm talking peaks of their talents in red, so 05/06 or 08/09 (playing behind Torres) Stevie vs 13/14 Suarez. 

It's the best midfielder in the world vs the best striker in the world at the height of their powers anyways. 

All good points raised. But also have to consider that Suarez had a much shorter career w/ us &amp; therefore will naturally have less defining moments. Also his time with us started shortly after a close call w/ administration, where we were in a complete rebuilding process. 

So while Stevie did it year after year for us, Suarez's 13/14 year was transcendent, mindboggling really. If he could replicate that for just next season as the question asks, it'd be incredibly hard to turn that down.

Suarez wilting in big games for us was an absolute myth, the stats may not be in his favor but he usually performed at a MOTM level. Immense vs Arsenal &amp; City in 2014 but no goal, he was always central to our attack in those kinds of matches tho. Others were benefactors usually as the defense tended put all their pressure on stopping him. Look at him w/ Barca where defenders can't do that, he bagged a goal/assist in almost every big match of theirs, he has that big game mentality. Obviously when you compare anybody to Stevie in that regard tho, they will inevitably come short of him. 

As for the selfishness, it's what drove him. Studge did the same where he'd shoot rather than pass which also frustrated Suarez, it was the nature of their relationship tho. They seemed to compete w/ each other almost to a fault at times but it drove them each to have their best seasons on an individual level. 

This is not to belittle Stevie's individual achievements but to defend Suarez's. I'd be happy with either obviously, but I definitely don't think it's clear cut in either one's favor if we're talking their absolute peaks.

null,null,Melberger,1972crest,,null,"**How do you think this season will go?**

Depending on the effect of the inevitable season long Guardiola rumours, I think we'll maintain a proper title challenge until April at least. Provided De Bruyne arrives, I can't see us finishing below 2nd. I hope for a good cup run, and maybe a domestic trophy. Will be nice to have a return to Wembley in the FA Cup, those memories of Wigan's dying moments winner are still sore ones. Hopefully we'll make it to the last 16 of the Champions League again as well, although we should aim for better. The Quarters should be a realistic target, progression in Europe has to be among our top targets - should be easier to do so as well given we're in pot 2 for the group draw this year as well.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

I actually think Sterling could prove a revelation. He'll be given a new lease of life at City, no pressure to carry his side or to be the sole focal point, he'll be one of several stars and he won't have to worry about being an opposition side's primary target for closing out of a game. He's already shown real promise dovetailing with Silva, and Aguero is yet to feature. I think he's precisely the kind of direct player we've been crying out for, and I could see the aforementioned players linking up very sweetly exploiting the space they each create for one another. I think he could leave some people very meek given how many have sought to write off his career hopes should he dared to leave the ""footballing citadel"" of Liverpool [Ian Darke]. The ""tears shed for the modern game"" [our friend Ian Darke again], may become the delight for a rising talent being given the stage to gravitate even further to the top, with England reaping the benefits going into Euro 2016. I suspect, and hope, that there may be many people eating their words at the end of the season. And how sweetly ironic would it be for it to be for City's own 'SAS' to shove those words back down the critics' throats?

If there is a God, and he has a sense of humour, that will happen. If he does exist, and he's a blue, during the title run-in Sterling will score a late winner at Anfield in front of the Kop, and proceed to do an Adebayor-esque knee slide in front of a baying crowd of Koppites - while Ian Darke commentates live for BT Sport.

**How do you think the team will line up?**

I think we've finally ditched 442, and we're going for more numbers in midfield, so we're less vulnerable out of possession. It also seems to be a change possibly suited to allowing an easier transition to Guardiola's style of play in a year (he is Txiki and Soriano's end game after all). 433, or 4231 seems to be the way of it for us this season. De Bruyne seems intent on a move here, and we seem destined to give him his wish, so my line-up is based on his inclusion. If he doesn't sign feel free to call me a prick. I'd like to see us as follows:

* -----------Aguero---------
* Sterling---Silva--De Bruyne
* -----Yaya---Fernandinho--
* Clichy--Mangala--Kompany--Zabaleta
* -------------Hart-----------

One to watch out for is young Jason Denayer, a really talented young Belgian centre half, just 20 years old and already a full international.

That's a perfect example of a leading question. It conflates personal finances and national budgets, and it also happened to be a prominent slogan used in the conservative party's election campaign (do a google search for the phrase, see how many Tory MP's say it in interviews...)

You ask the same question in a different way ""should the government cut vital public services to achieve fiscal consolidation"" and see what result you get.

Other point - since the Labour party was also committed to reducing the deficit in the last election, and since the Labour party has made no attempt to counter the deficit fetishism that marks much of our popular (ie newspaper led) discourse on economics, it's hardly a surprise people go along with it. 

If you don't make any attempt to establish a narrative of your own you can hardly be surprised when the public accepts the narrative offered elsewhere, even if it's a narrative based on pure fantasy.

People in the British Isles have some of the lowest levels, if not the lowest level, of melanin in their skin because the constant cloud cover in conjunction with the latitude means very little sunlight penetrates the atmosphere.

Considering that the primary function of melanin is to prevent the penetration of cancer causing UV rays into the body, and that melanin disrupts the production of vitamin D, it logically follows that different selective pressures in different climates would result in the expression of different phenotypes. In our case the reduced levels of melanin in populations found in climates with lower levels of sunlight. Lower levels of sunlight makes producing vitamin D more difficult, while at the same time reduces the selective pressure for higher levels of melanin in the skin, as reduced sunlight means reduced UV radiation.

But Gerrard in his prime was every bit as good as suarez is now, and to top it off can pick a team up and singlehandedly win massive games for the club.

How depressing for him to commit his entire life and career to our club only to be maligned by fans for doing exactly what he's told (and doing it very well...). He just has a very one dimensional role in the squad and he gets scapegoated for it. Don't be so quick to judge him just because he's not entertaining. My comment about the Nigerian coach reflects that he's not one dimensional by nature but rather he obviously showed an exceptional talent for shutting down a game and that's what he's ordered to do by managers now.

In terms of stats his passing is always above 90% after a season which is better than similar players who play short passes of an equal distance. He rarely gets dribbled past as well and he isn't an enforcer who fouls which can be valuable when holding leads. People froth Matic because he's excellent at interceptions, tackles and marking but Mikels skillset is there but isn't as valued from a viewing perspective. 

I'm not jumping out of my seat cheering when he gets subbed on because it dulls our attack but I can at least respect that we rarely concede when he comes and shuts the opposition out. There's a reason Mourinho, a manager who builds titles on defending tight leads, trusts him with his job. 

Also his salary is 75k and I'd say that's not ridiculously inflated considering our wage bill and his time at the club. He's been here for 10 years so every contract renewal (4 now I think) he'd be getting a pay bump. He's just ahead of amazing players like Oscar Willian and Azpi but that's only because they haven't gotten a new contract. He definitely built his way up to 75k a week and loyalty bonuses will always play a role in wage negotiations. If we were signing him now he'd be 30-50 at best which is around what Moses gets (50k).

There's actually quite a bit more regulation than that, at least in theory, and lights that ""cause undue dazzle or discomfort to other users of the road"" are actually illegal.

The police however are somewhat liberal on the actual application of the law, being most concerned that there is just a red one on the back and a white one on the front, but I don't think this is unreasonable given that cyclists without lights at all is a substantially larger issue than ones with front lights so powerful that they dazzle oncoming motorists.

Here's the start of the abstract:

&gt; Energy consumption of residential buildings and offices adds up to about 30% of total carbon dioxide emissions; and occupant behaviour contributes to 80% of the variation in energy consumption1. Indoor climate regulations are based on an empirical thermal comfort model that was developed in the 1960s (ref. 2). Standard values for one of its primary variables—metabolic rate—are based on an average male, and may overestimate female metabolic rate by up to 35% (ref. 3). This may cause buildings to be intrinsically non-energy-efficient in providing comfort to females. Therefore, we make a case to use actual metabolic rates.

A lot of ""experts"" seem to be writing City off, I haven't seen anyone predict us winning the league and I've actually seen a few rank us 5th. While that's not impossible the talent on City should put us no lower than 3rd and at least within touching distance of first. a CB and CM could put us over the top, but right now I think 2nd is where we end up realistically.

Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

Aguero. Always Aguero. He is our best player and will be the star of the season again. Think Sterling will do just fine, Silva will be our second best, and Delph will turn into a huge fan favorite. Problem is our back four will always be the worst players on the field for us at any given moment.

How do you think the team will line up?

When everyone is fit:
4-3-3

Zaba/Kompany/Mangala/Clichy

Delph/Toure/Fernandinho

Sterling/Aguero/Silva


Players like Denayar/Iheanacho/Bony/Navas will do fine off the bench, but again I expect City to look for a couple more defensemen (one inside and one outside) and one more midfielder. If those moves are made, no doubt we can top Chelsea.

The best rates for domestic mortgages tend to start at 75% LTV (Loan To Value). That means you want a 25% deposit if possible. 

This means you need savings of at least £32,500.  Of course, house buying is expensive - you need to pay for solicitors, tax, removals company, redecoration. And, it is possible that house prices will continue to rise. 

I would guess that you'll need at least £50,000 in savings in 3-4 years time. 

Secondly, you need to understand likely lending criteria. Banks generally lend up to 4x your salary - although they will take into account your regular spending commitments. If you want 75% of £130k, you'll need a salary of at least £25k.  Is that realistic for your career path? 

I would recommend going to your bank / building society this week and making an appointment with their mortgage advisors. Tell them what you are trying to do and ask them what you would need to be earning / have in deposit, to make this happen. 

You don't need to sign anything, or take a mortgage there and then - but it will give you a good idea of what you need to aim for.

null,null,barejokez,null,null,null,"it's kind of based on the stocks you've named, but not really - if you said you were planning to buy RBS and tesco you probably would have got similar replies (maybe a bit less strong).

it's based on what little we know (or guess) about you.  if you were a millionaire with an existing portfolio asking this question we would be more forgiving (and confused!). 

however, in asking for this advice, you make it pretty clear that you probably don't own any stocks (and you certainly have never bought any yourself). so it's unlikely that this is part of a diverse portfolio.

also, £12k is a lot of money to most people (myself included). there is a 99% chance that you aren't really wealthy and can't easily afford the risk of losing money on this scale.

next, you've picked two company names that are really ""buzzy"". this is a classic beginner mistake: ""netflix is gonna be huge, all my friends use it and i see good news headlines all the time"". that's fine, but the share price is surprisingly disconnected from this story.  there are a lot of people investing in this stock already, and they are making that decision on the same information as you. the share price may or may not appear expensive depending on whether you have a more or less optimistic view of the company than the rest of the investor base. it isn't about being optimistic overall (because we all are), it is about being above average optimism (that's a simplification, but a decent one).

finally, the decision to go 50/50 on these particular stocks is indicative of inexperience.  Amazon is about 5x as big as netflix (depending on how you measure it), and it would therefore seem more appropriate to invest more in the bigger company, if you're trying to be balanced. also, these are both US stocks, which means you will be exposed to currency risk. imagine how annoying it would be if the stocks go up 20% and the USD price dropped 20% (so your returns are 0%)? Now imagine how annoying it would be if the currency drops 20% and the stock doesn't move?

please remember that the negative responses you receive are us trying to be helpful. it isn't fun to see people make mistakes with money, whether it's their inheritance or life savings or student loan. there are ways to invest in the stock market with the aim of making sensible returns, and there are ways to use it to effectively gamble. both strategies are fine, but if you are going to gamble (which your strategy amounts to), you shouldn't be making big bets unless you can really afford it.",null,0,null,1438756786,null,null,false,0,cts2b6z,null,t3_3fqmws,null,null,null,t1_ctru5dw,null,null,null,1440290954,null,3,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

1. Look at the league/ratings tables to find out who is best for your course. There are multiple ways to do this but the Guardian one is pretty well recognised and reliable: http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2015/may/25/university-league-tables-2016
Also see: http://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide

2. Read some opinions from people who actually study there. These are just opinions so bear in mind you can't find out everything by doing this - but it will help. This site is often recommended: http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk

3. Start narrowing it down to a handful of places. Make sure you have the grades to attend. Feel free to contact the admissions people there if you're not sure (but remember to treat this interaction like an interview, as they may well remember you, and be the person who decides whether you get in!)

4. Finally, do some detailed research since you can't always tell from the uni website etc. what they're really like. Look into what the town, accommodation, etc. are like as well as the teaching quality, class sizes etc. Some unis are on a campus outside of a town, whereas others are spread all over a city in different buildings, or a few places around a smaller town.

null,null,cw287,null,null,null,"Ok I'd like to clarify what I meant by wilting in big games a bit better. There are a few games from 13/14 where we desperately needed a goal - city away, Chelsea home etc. - and Suarez did not score. And as the minutes ticked on he became increasingly selfish and frustrated and therefore increasingly less likely to score... and of course we lost these games and therefore the title slipped away (1 goal against City would've put us on the same points tally come the end of the season). Stevie on the other hand has countless examples of stepping up to the plate when we really need a goal - just look at this list for one http://xtra.liverpoolfc.com/listicles/revealed-steven-gerrard-s-10-best-last-gasp-liverpool-goals. What's interesting about this list is it's not exclusive to ""Gerrard in his prime"", showing how much of an impact he's had throughout his career, and it also doesn't show crucial goals before the 85th minute (notable exclusions therefore include his goal in Istanbul and his first in 06 FA Cup Final). 
I'm not bashing Suarez at all, his talents are clear for all to behold, and had the two players been at Liverpool in their prime at the se time I truly believe we would have waltzed to the league title (especially when at this time we had Torres in his prime as well). However, Suarez in his prime did for one season what Gerrard in his prime did repeatedly, and arguably with a better core of players around him than Gerrard had at times (Gerrard never played alongside Gerrard for example, although of course Xabi wasn't half bad).

For the lazy, the advice can really be summed up into two points-

There are definitely arguments for both and I truly love them both but I can't stop thinking that my answer is Suarez. 

If you take Stevie's best season when Rafa stuck him behind Torres I can't help thinking that Stevie had his best season because Torres was infront of him. But then I start thinking about the Europa League qualifier against Napoli I think and Gerrard came on and scored a hattrick within 20 minutes. Clearly showed he was a level above. He doesn't shout at team mates he simply inspires them 

With Suarez we are talking about one of the best strikers the world. If you watch his top 30 goals no one comes close except Tony Yeboah on repeat. He could play in any team in any league and instantly make them better 

So to answer your question, particularly about ""next season"" then my answer would be Suarez . With the team we currently have then Suarez would make much more of a difference than Gerrard ......I can't believe I've just said that :/

""I think there's a bit of a problem when it's warmer outside than it is inside your office.""

What? Wait... so in the middle of summer, when temperatures in the UK can reach 31c outside, she believes the office should also be 31c? So that she can wear fashionable clothes?

""So, what's the solution then?""

Apparently it's 'flexibility' and 'common sense'. Radhika doesn't quite see the irony here. 

At the VERY end she points out: ""maybe there can be some flexibility with men not having to wear suits in some offices and they can come in in T-shirts instead"".

Really? Are you being serious? The entire issue is that men 'have to' wear suits, which means they lower the air con, which affects women who can wear any (albeit business appropriate) clothing they like, sleeves or no. 

*Or maybe none of this is 'sexist' and as Radhika points out, the solution is 'flexibility' - the flexibility to have cardigan or whatever at hand - and 'common sense' - the common sense not to go cold just because having a warm shawl or whatever is 'inconvenient'.

Ream though probably merits a 6/10 but as said before he was our best player (apparently) for the last 2 seasons so I think that also probably shows you how poor our players are rather than how good he is.

Personally I think he wont be able to play 1st division football (BPL) as I don't think he is good enough however he is solid enough for Championship Football (2nd Division)

Print journalism has fallen because it can't control the narrative or the information any more. 30 years ago when a paper said X you either believed X or didn't believe X, you had no alternative. Papers seemed more authoritative because they were realistically the only source most people had.

Since the internet:

1. Stories break faster than printers can roll.

2. We can see just how much bullshit the papers print.

All that has happened is the papers are now honest. They can no longer pretend their opinions are fact so they've changed to being dominated by open opinion pieces rather than disguised opinion pieces.

The overtaking thing does often seem silly - a risky move for only a few seconds at the most but I think cyclists are unpredictable. They can be going at less than walking pace right up to over the speed limit. If there is an opportunity to overtake, people can just take it, even if in hindsight it seems pointless. Bikes do it too, I see them overtake each other without looking, or taking little shortcuts over pavements which save them seconds.

&gt;the banks could simply create more money out of thin air to solve all their liquidity troubles instead of having to rely on the taxpayer.

Not really as they create debt that they need to think will be paid back with interest, they create debt out of thin air in the hope it will be paid back plus interest, as most of our money is debt, debt and money becomes synonymous. But anyway I think we both agree on the process and it is just the terminology we disagree on, [but there is a large debate on this](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/steve-keen/keen-krugman-debate)  and we will have to just agree to disagree.

&gt;They can reduce or increase the supply of money in the economy via printing new money without the same sorts of obligations as other commercial banks.

Unfortunately 97% of new money is created by private banks for private profit which I think is wrong and therefore the BoE can't really change the money supply much by printing money, they can restrict or help expand the money private banks create through interest rates although how much this is effective is controversial. I would set up an independent institution that could print non-debt money if and when the economy required it to invest in infrastructure. (This would be similar to Corbyn's idea of QE for the people).

&gt;I have no problem with the idea of public banks printing money that's one of their jobs.

Let me update it for your situation...

-------
I inherited a similar sum when I was a few years older than you.  Here's what I wish I'd known...

- Friends can react very oddly when you come in to money. People who you think are your friends really just want you to buy them drinks / pay off their loans.  You don't have to tell anyone about this windfall (except, possibly, the taxman. More on that later!)
- It's *really* easy to piss that sum of money away. Bottle of bubbly at a club, taxis home rather than the bus, jewellery for a ""friend"".  Have a little fun with the money - but keep a detailed budget so you know where it's going.
- There are people who will help you - for a fee.  Look at finding an IFA or Wealth Manager you can trust.  They will be able to talk to you about the level of risk with which you're comfortable, and find suitable investments for you.
- Don't go to your bank for help.  Their job is to sell *their own* products.  They won't advise you if the bank down the street has a better rate of return.  Find someone who can look at the whole market.
- Do tell the taxman about the money.  Depending on the complexity of your investments, it may be worth getting an accountant.  They'll help make sure that you pay what you owe the state - and potentially suggest (legal) ways for you to minimise your tax exposure.
- Make sure that all your bank accounts have strong passwords and decent security questions.  Your entire family and childhood friends know what your mother's maiden name is - and what your first pet was called.
- Finally, don't let this go to your head.  £100k is *not* enough money to live on indefinitely.  It's enough to kick-start a business, fund a PhD, have some exotic holidays, or get on the housing ladder - but you can't retire just yet.  Concentrate on getting the best degree you can - and get plenty of useful work experience now you don't have to stack shelves between lectures.

-----------

To add to that, in your case, stick that large sum away in a low-risk venture that you can't touch for a few years.  Then forget about it.

You're probably going to live another 70 years.  This money is equivalent to an extra £2k per year.  It's not a lot.

As for the £5k you've got spare. Don't use it to buy friends.  Again, people react strangely when you're the one always buying an extra round etc.  Invest it in your studies - get a decent laptop, travel to conferences in your field of study, etc.

Clegg got into government for a start.

It helps that Corbyn is old enough that he is unlikely to last that long at the top of politics.

I see the period 2015 to 2020 as a choice between failure by chasing the tories to the right constantly and being seen as 'the pale imitation tory party' or failure because Labour doesn't coddle the middle aged and elderly enough with a pretty face, soothing tones and comforting blandishments that everything will be pretty much the same; apart from a tougher crackdown on undesirables like the young, the noisy, the foreign and the unpleasantly poor. Which is usually the formula that wins elections in England.

At least Corbyn might manage to educate a generation as to what Labour is supposed to be for.

I was never convinced it was our national top transport priority.

Personally, I like Burnham's plan to upgrade East-West links. Having done a lot of train travel, it's always grated that the only nice journeys are to and from London.

For instance, it's not really quicker or cheaper to go from Cambridge to Birmingham direct than it is to go via London, even though the London route involves a tube connection. It's also a crap-load less comfortable on the 'even the fastest train stops at virtually every station' cross-country line.

As for Coutinho being marked out of the game - this won't happen if he's in the middle which is what I expect. Gomez and Moreno seem to be quite keen to attack so I don't foresee any of the overlap problems you're talking about. When Flanno comes back he'll probably play on the right - which is his more natural position, where he'll be happier to get further forward. Remember he was only playing on the left because of a lack of options there.

Re counterattacking - We very seldom can play this type of game because a lot of teams tend to set up behind the ball against us, but if we do get an opportunity to counterattack we'll be fine. Our fullbacks are super pacey, Milner and Hendo can run for days, Phil is Phil, and Benteke will be used to counterattacking from his Villa days.

Southampton are ready to open contract talks with midfielder Victor Wanyama.

The Kenya international has two years remaining on his current deal but Southampton want to protect their asset, a player who cost them £12.5million. They were forced to strike a deal with Liverpool for Nathaniel Clyne after allowing his contract to run towards its final 12 months and don't want that to happen with Wanyama. The 24-year-old has been a mainstay in Southampton's last two Premier League campaigns helping protect one of the best defensive records in the division. 

Yet he has seen the club sell Clyne, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Morgan Schneiderlin while there are also concerns over the future of Jose Fonte. Wanyama has been watched by Arsenal and Tottenham in the past but has developed under Ronald Koeman who is keen to continue building around him. 

Southampton have signed Jordy Clasie but also sent scout Andreas Fehse to watch Schalke's Leon Goretzka in the friendly against Twente on Sunday. Koeman's side are willing to pay up to £11.2m but Schalke are reluctant to sell the 20-year-old Germany international. Schalke general manager Horst Heldt told BILD: 'We do not have the intention to sell Leon (Goretzka), Leon Goretzka is under contract at our club.'

Southampton are also waiting on Virgil van Dijk coming through unscathed for Celtic against Qarabag in their Champions League qualifier on Wednesday. They are ready to make a formal offer of around £8million.

Students in China tend to be good at easily quantifiable skills such as maths but I find they are just no where near as good at skills such as critical thinking and creative problem solving.

Additionally I am of the opinion that the different school systems feed into the different workplace culture, which results in a VERY top down management culture.

Obviously take all the above with a pinch of salt as I am just one English guy with his personal experience teaching English in China.

Personally I do believe some lessons can be taken from the Chinese system, but we should not resort to the idea that 'our kids are too lazy so lets go full Asian parent stereotype on them'.

null,null,preparationhguzzler,num8-away,,null,"Here's what I've got, I want to stay true to Poch's vision.

Starting XI:

Gk: Lloris (el capitano, sweeper keeper, allows the high press to occur and kicks a foot into the anuses of our defenders.)

Rb: Trippier (has to happen, early crosses to Kane and Chadli, pinpoint pass backs from bylines to eriksen, dembele, and something to prove and to motivate kyle, who could come on later)

RCB: Alderweireld (premier League starting experience and composure over dier, who is next choice, prove point with purchase, he will step up)

LCB: Wimmer (our best cb from what I have seen. He needs to play, what a great player, vertonghen's attitude disappoints me, and if he wasn't so stubborn he could be cdm and do damn well, so I am bitter and think he is waste of salary)

LB: rose (sorry ben, but this one is obvious. Huge player for us, just needs to minimize turning off episodes defensively, could front men in box, but his offensive prowess and tenacity excite me. As an American, he reminds me of the positives of American or central american competitive attitude)

Pivot 2:

Alli and Bentaleb: this is the potential pinnacle of pivot 2's. I say go for it, shoot for the stars. They may be too skinny and naive at this point, but with the work ethics and raw and pure abilities at such a young age as allí and bentaleb, what the fuck are you doing if you don't throw the eggs in their basket. Mason is fine. Whatever, energetic and decent iq offensively, some technical ability but not an amount to justify defensive retardation by eliminating his own presence with persistent overrunning.


Allí and bentaleb could become a duo where both can be box to box. Bentaleb is perfecting his arts with a focus on defensive, precision passing, and ball retention. Alli is box to box I can see a bright shuttling future with assists and goal scoring. People ask for a defensive mid this summer, and in the short term they may seem the greedy, but I feel greedy with my desire to utilize bentaleb as the defensive force and Alli as his defensively able but offensively concerned mate.

A substitution for vertonghen would satisfy me in times of trouble or fatigue or if ahead by 2.


3 behind da 1 and only:

Right side dominant: Lamela  (he needs to be considered the star and starter and if that fails he is gone, simple as that)

Centrally dominant: eriksen (please find your fucking creativity and energy and unlock  the d like we know you should be able to do)

Left side: Chadli (a finisher, pinch in and let the rose roam)

The one and only:

Striker: Harry Kane

Finisher of early crosses. Creator of own attempts from 14-22 yds. Back to goal option. Diagonal runner. Important press spark defensively. Wins award for ""most should have played Neville longbottom"".


Important messages to squad:

For lloris:

Keep the squad energy up on defensive and influence counter energy.

For Trippier:

Early crosses, no overcommits. Smart d.

For toby:

Smart play, quickly move ball into offensive, make pass in precession of opposition striker getting behind ball and encourage counters. Listen to lloris. High kine but you aren't a risk taker or offensive maestro.

For wimmer:

Same distribution messages as toby and additionally pump him up, nurture respect for lloris, and demand aerial prowesses. No dumb mistakes, stay turned on.

For rose:

Your movement is vital to offensive, but you are getting way too old for individual errors on defense. No moping. No attention to referees. Play some fucking football. Early crosses to kane.


For bentaleb:

Strict defensive positioning. Encourage counter when transitioning to forward players. Do not allow recipients of your passes the luxury of slowing down and returning the ball to you. Demand attacking attitude from teammates while supplying defensive persistence and piercing medium to long range balls to spread defense.

For alli:

You are the shuttler. Move the ball from defense to offense to create numbers situations. Beat your man and demand movement from attackers. Play off of them and be the catalyst to offense. Limit passes to walker, rose, bentaleb, and cb's.

For eriksen:

You are a 10 who works closely with a set of striker and forwards. You can drift left and encourage Chadli to play additional striker. Defensively stay alert, position well, but we can't kill ourselves. Work hard when we have numbers. Occasional alli cover.

For chadli:

At times lw but frequently second striker. Help rose defensively, but bentaleb is also available for assitance. Second striker is huge when ball is on the right. Rose must stay back. Get in behind. Confuse defense. Fluid and direct offensive interplay. Utilize numbers situations.

For lamela:

Take people on. Press. Dangerous passes in the final third are so worth the effort. Look for chadli second striker. Help Trippier on defense, when alli makes serious plays upfield with others, cover.

For kane:

Finish well. Be persistent. Confuse d with lamela and eriksen and especially chadli

For whole team, main points:

Persistent running on offense. Cover each others asses. Utilize numbers opportunities.

The airline then has the choice to either pass that cost onto the consumer (the guy making the deal) or eat it and hopefully find someway to innovate and emit less. Or if flying was more expensive companies might decide to do more business by video call and therefore demand for air traffic would be less.  The counter argument is often that a tax like this may cause inflation which offsets the rise.

More seriously; traditionally wedding gifts have been on the assumption that the couple are about to set up a household together for the first time. That's often not an accurate assumption these days, but has led to a bit of a theme of wedding gifts being durable, practical things. That's not an absolute requirement, but is still a bit of a theme. It's good to have a lasting reminder of the wedding around the house that you see and maybe use regularly.

However, I have met some racist people so I won't deny that racism exists! It also exists in London by the way. It's likely to be the same anywhere. These are minority views which are unpopular and not socially acceptable, but you do encounter them every so often wherever you go.

Some places are very traditional (Scottish highlands, for example) and you might find cultural differences if you're going to really small communities that haven't changed much in a long time. For example I met a very racist (but very friendly, talkative) man in a pub in Somerset. He lived in a rural, white community and didn't seem to know that he was being incredibly rude because he thought that his views were 'normal'. You might encounter this sort of ignorance in some poorer rural places, where older people aren't very experienced with the outside world because they've lived in the same village all their lives.

Hanging out in a village for few hours is very different to actually living in it. I do not recommend living in a village. Contrary to what other people say, you will always feel out of place and you will face few cases of racism, although not outright. It's extremely unlikely for you to be prevented from doing something or attending a place because of your colour but you will be treated differently by very small minority. If you can handle it, then go ahead. It's not good place for anyone (minority or not) not past their retirement age to retire anyway.

The law is not simply a tool for those who have power, it is a call to reason and allows us to acknowledge what reality suggests is fair and just. Holding people to account for their crimes is step 2 of 2. The first step noting the error, is as distinct as it is important.

Justice needs to be seen to be done, for the same reason.. because reality invokes a righteous indignation in those who witness crimes; in the absence of justice being acknowledged, injustice is encouraged.

While a fair court can rule that injustice has occurred, it should do so and set out the reasoning used to come to that conclusion.

You don't need to be able to regurgitate their profit margins for the last five years or anything, but you should be reasonably well informed on their big clients, what countries they operate in, general information about their sector and who their competitors are and what they do.

For the weaknesses question, from what I've read (I've prepared for this question in the past, but it's not actually come up yet), it's best to pick a real but relatively moderate weakness you have, and then explain how you've been trying to improve on it. I would seriously advise you against saying something like ""I'm a perfectionist, blah blah blah"" because it's a bullshit answer and your interviewers will be probably know it's a bullshit answer.

I hate the 'animal' question (and its many variations), but it's basically just asking for your strengths. So be aware of what your strengths are and then answer with an animal relative to that, e.g. ""I would be a lion because I'm competitive but I also work well in a team..."" (I'd advise you to pick a less shit answer than that haha, but that's the general idea).

Whenever possible, try and back up your answers with evidence, and evidence from outside your degree will most likely be looked upon favourably.

I would like to make some points though. 

-As long as Brendan Rodgers is in charge of the club, I support our football club. I'm disappointed to be claimed not a Liverpool fan for pinpointing managerial flaws.

-Yes, currently my opinion is that I'm not a fan of him (which doesn't mean I won't back him as long as he manages our club). This doesn't mean there is nothing I like about him. He is a young manager who will obviously have flaws and some way to learn, and I posted an article a few months ago highlighting this.  

-I know that a lot of points are biased, and that's because this simply was a one sided argument. If I were to comment on the other side, I would of course talk about some of the transfers I liked eg. Benteke and Lallana, him getting the best out of Luis Suarez  and the praise he has received from figures such as Steven Gerrard. I would also consider writing an article on why he's not all bad. 

I don't categorically dismiss pro-Rodgers supporters and people are allowed an opinion. There are some reasons I cannot stand our manager; that doesn't mean I don't see any good in him. I feel like people would prefer a more defensive article such as this

It's alright to let the Shi'a Arabs be oppressed and the Kurds face savage attacks for stability? 

&gt; His ideology was secular and he was an Arab Socialist. Look what we have now (Daesh). Which do you prefer?

Saddam was hardly secular, his power base was the Sunni minority and he suppressed the Shi'a majority of Iraq.  

&gt;I think the motivation to depose him was not oil, but to prevent Syria and Iraq combining under Ba'athism to become a regional superpower.

I'm not sure how Iraq led by megalomaniacal dictator and Syria led by less megalomaniacal dictator could unite to form a country. 


&gt;I think Ba'athism was the Middle East's window of opportunity to a better future. Bad things were done in the name of it, but at least it was a secular ideology in the name of social progress. A society advancing towards more egalitarian ideology is a very slow process, and we can't expect backwards (but advancing) states to behave like angels. The West certainly did not.

Ba'athism failed in Syria and Iraq, becoming like other authoritarian party based countries it forbade any criticism of the party or the leader and brutally suppressed  any dissidents.    

&gt;Anyway, Saddam didn't even have WMDs. The whole gig was done purposefully in order to fund arms industries and perpetually destabilise the middle east. It is brutal, capitalist Realpolitik.

&gt;The whole 'illegal war' concept is on dodgy ground anyway. We have the UN but there isn't really a global police force and the UN itself is beset by international politics. I mean Russia sit on the Security Council. Would their veto mean any Western intervention anywhere is deemed an illegal war? My impression, I am not a lawyer, would mean that Yes it would be. 

Security Council agreement is probably the most clear-cut way of assessing the legality of the use of force but it's not the only way. The others are self-defense and there is an idea of preventing an imminent humanitarian catastrophe, but Iraq doesn't fit either of those cases. The British Government tried to argue that the Security Council resolution approving the first Gulf War still stood, and the 2003 invasion was just a continuation of that war, but virtually no lawyer buys this argument and in any case it would require a separate resolution from the Security Council to make that decision - Britain can't just declare it is so. There have been some *post hoc* arguments that ""responsibility to protect"" makes Iraq legal but again, that relies on a misreading of the doctrine and so it doesn't apply to Iraq, either.

In terms of a Russian veto - the system is *designed* to make consensus difficult. It's not like a Parliamentary system where the intent is good governance or swift passing of legislation - it's meant to severely restrict the use of force to only the rare instances in which the five permanent members of the Security Council agree on the need for action. Saying it's ""ineffective"" is like criticising a forest for having too much wood - it's supposed to be that way.

&gt;Essentially a handful of countries decide what is legal and what is not and other nations can take a hike. Some countries will likely never get done and instead the deposed despots of smaller nations will be easy pickings for any prosecution.

This isn't that far from the truth and one criticism of the ICC in particular is that it spends more time prosecuting African warlords than, say, western war criminals, but it's not up for countries to ""decide"" what is legal. International law is formed on the basis of state practise, *opinio juris*, and *jus cogens* which basically means that something can become part of international law by virtue of it being practised by the majority of states who in doing so believed they were acting according to a principle of law. So in other words you can't point to states who do illegal things without caring about the legality - the principle has to be shown. *Jus cogens*, meanwhile, covers crimes for which there is no means of escaping illegality - unilateral military action *per se* isn't *jus cogens*, but aggression, torture and crimes against humanity are, and it's here where Blair, Bush *et al* could be got.

&gt;There is no real concept of international law. It's still all global politics where the powerful rule. These discussions of the 'illegal war' work well in coffee shops and Reddit but it doesn't apply to the way the world works.

All I'd say to this is pick up an international law textbook because it's just not true at all. There is a problem with enforcement, but international criminal law is a fairly recent concept so it's not surprising that there are difficulties in how to bring powerful westerners to justice. It's not a perfect or complete system by any means, but to claim it doesn't exist is far from the truth.",null,0,null,1438774308,null,null,1438774605,0,cts6wd0,null,t3_3fthzj,null,null,null,t1_cts4s5a,null,null,null,1440293181,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Do you really think, that had we known Iraq had no WMD's in the first place, that we still would have gone to war? Ask yourself why we never invaded Saudi Arabia.

We also can't attempt to justify the invasion without considering what followed after. Surely if the operation was to be deemed a success then the removal of the regime was only one piece of the puzzle. We failed to stabilize the country, in doing so we let the people of Iraq down, and we let ourselves down in allowing Iraq to become a hotbed for even more violent conflict and extremism.

Actually it's more about the use of the term 'cockroach'. When you debase people to the level of vermin you really are appealing to the most abhorrent forms of thinking. Rwanda and the Nazi's are two perfectly relevant instances of the level of aggressive rhetoric that asks people to debase humans simply based on their unfortunate situation. You wouldn't go in blackface with a watermelon to a fancy dress party if you had half a brain, re-kindling the type of talk that was central to the Rwandan genocide (and the Nazi's) is also a very bad decision. 

Oz journalist Jenna Price compared the Australian Government to the Nazi Party for its treatment of asylum seekers. Mike Godwin (the founder of the law) himself commented on Twitter that these comparisons were justified.

Rotherham and Hibs are not battling for the same prize, so there is no inflated price for league rivals. It's not a totally drastic move to deny the sale of *any* player to a league rival, so there needs to be something extra in a transfer between Hibs and Rangers in order to tempt the club into a sale.

If it were...say...Nicky Law and Hibs were looking to sign him at this point, would you not say that it would be a little bit daft of Rangers to allow him to leave for anything other than a big bid? I would.

Same thing goes for Allan. 

A sensible bid is *only* one that has a chance of being accepted. 

In the current circumstances, these low bids by Rangers have no chance, a similar bid from a team outwith the battle for the league *could* be a little less but I think Hibs are pretty committed to keeping him at this point, so ~£300,000 from anyone is wasting everyone's time imo.",null,0,null,1438776743,null,null,false,0,cts7pmx,null,t3_3frwnq,null,null,null,t1_cts7d3n,null,null,null,1440293563,null,1,null,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1,null

 But then again, I haven't ever found an episode of New Who Doctor Who scary because the 'scary' stories aren't about things or aren't done in a way that I would find scary. 

But everyone is different. Some people find the Weeping Angels scary, some people find the Daleks scary, some people find the Kandyman scary, everyone will find different things scary.

I find the core concepts behind the scary scenes and scary episodes *can* be interesting and maybe worrying more than scary. I don't find things featuring Satan or other like things because they aren't *really* applicable to everyday Human life (although, I could argue that the *Impossible Planet* has hints of it, but anyway). 
But the Cybermen's concept, and their first appearance, are worrying to me rather than scary because I can see that could be a direction that the Human race could head towards. But they usually aren't written in an inherently scary way. 

I could go on, and on, and on with providing different examples but I think I have hopefully made my point.

**TL;DR: Everyone finds different things scary.**


EDIT: I can't help but add something else.

This means my clients have to be the kind of people who can throw that kind of money around. 

Even outside of London, you're looking at musicians earning 25-45ph for teaching/directing (the two most common avenues outside of London) and clients have to have that kind of money. 

To pay for two kids to have piano lessons once a week will be 1-2k/year + cost of a piano (2-6k) + music costs (50-200/year dependent on how much and how you source it) and also require enough free time to get them to their teacher's or to supervise lessons at your own house. 

Even cheaper options like dance classes or acting classes will out you back about 500-1k/year. Drama workshops vary from 80-110 for a week (understaffed and just passable workshops in a cheap venue) to 800-1100 for a week (top youth theatre groups at internationally known professional venues with plentiful support staff). 

And many of these groups subsidise costs through income from shows. That means venues, that means finding customers, that means providing staff that can get your amateur company to a sellable quality (and there's precious few professional companies that survive up in the North alone, and many tour London and Europe instead)

I rarely work outside of London. It's for good reason. My clients are middle class or higher and that's mostly because if you don't have that kind of job you don't have that kind of money.

With the first formation, Henderson is not just wasted but probably very risky at the base of the diamond. The author has done it to fit both couts and firmino in but in reality with the diamond it's one or the other. Allen/Lucas/Can have to play at the base and we can't get away from the fact that all three of them do have major issues with fulfilling that role. The formation also puts a lot of reliance on the fullbacks. Gomez is not going to be first team week in week out so it would be Moreno there and I am dubious about how much he can be relied on to do what would be an awful lot of work in that formation.

With the second formation Sturridge is shunted out wide. Someone indicated he has never played there for us, I don't believe that's true, he did have one or two games there before the 13/14 diamond was established. Needless to say it was not the right choice and it would not be now either, so it's Benteke or Sturridge not both. This formation is really a 4231 which is a good idea on paper but in preseason didn't work. Probably will be tried at some stage though.

Overall, we can only play them both in a diamond and I think it would be risky, possibly try it at home against Norwich, something like that, but with a midfield of allen, hendo, milner and firmino or couts.",null,0,null,1438777564,null,null,false,0,cts80fa,null,t3_3fv0mh,null,null,null,t3_3fv0mh,null,null,null,1440293705,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I'd maybe disagree with that a little bit. I've still been asked ""what school did you go to?"" by police officers a few times. It's a lesser problem that it was before, but it's still an issue I'd say.

But the way they are tackling sectarianism at football games is just all wrong. It's shutting down genuine expressions of support for football teams and playing a role in killing the game.

&gt; one has to ask who picks the list of banned materials.

If you're talking about limiting free speech; it already is in Scotland. 

The European Convention on Human Rights lists a possibility to restrict speech if it's deemed to be ""Hate Speech"", and a lot of the sing-songs about being *up to your knees* etc fall into that category. So I'd trust the ECHR to decide, but not really Police Scotland; I'd not put it past them to call *Let the People Sing* and *Rule Britannia* ""hate speech"".

&gt; Drinking? Folk free load before the game anyway. If you're blind drunk at the start you still will be 90 minutes after.

I'm fully behind shattering *all* our country's fears about alcohol. Continental nations have a very relaxed attitude to it and it's proven to be the right approach. But I feel alcohol is used too much by police and government to attack groups like football fans and young people, so we're probably stuck being scared of it as a nation.

I hope Hibs keep him TBH and Rangers sign him on a pre in Jan (assuming he still wants to come to Rangers). Rangers get a potentially big signing (in relative terms) for the following season and Hibs get sod all, that to me is the sensible thing to do.

Is that correct? From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_Tax#How_Council_Tax_is_spent):
""Although it is the only tax which is set by local government in Great Britain, the Council Tax ostensibly contributes only a small proportion (25%, on average) of local government revenue. The majority ostensibly comes from central government funding, either as grants, or in the form of business rates which are collected centrally and redistributed to local authorities.""

Councils receive all of the council tax paid by residents, yet it makes up only about 25% of the income they receive. 

&gt;the name was a successful attempt by the Thatcher administration to make it appear to the public that they were paying directly for local services and have them heap blame for high taxation on Councils rather than the government.

This may well still be correct though, as local services are determined much more by central government funding than local council funding. We have the situation at the moment where council tax goes up, but services go down (because of central government funding cuts), and thus people get annoyed at the councils and see a lack of 'value for money'.

   Kane

Chadli - Eriksen - Lamela

Alli - Bentaleb

Rose - Vert - Toby - Walker

Lloris (c)

_____________________

**Justifications**:

*Kane* - It's kind of obvious, isn't it?

*Chadli* - Chadli has the physicality to get past defenders down the line like none of our other players can. He also has good positioning and is one of the only players who moves off the ball (why the fuck that is so hard for our boys to get, I'm not sure).

*Eriksen* - We need our creative center, which is what Eriksen provides when he's on his game. And I really hope he's on his game. If he plays, he'll probably be constantly followed by Schneiderlin, but more on that later. 

*Lamela* - Until Yarmo (please, God) arrives, Erik should be at RM. He's one of our best AMs in defense, even if he can be a bit too eager. His run against Real was great, but his skied shot was very disappointing (I wish he'd stay the fuck on his feet when shooting).

*Alli* - I've been very impressed with him in these pre-season games and I think he has the composure to be baptized by fire in the pits of Old Trafford. More on this below, but I think his height is paramount. 

*Bentaleb* - Can't not play him. On his day, he's a majestic midfielder. 

*Rose* - Again, another easy pick. One of the best LBs playing in England. His surges up the field against Real and the MLS AS were heavenly and I look for him to be a key factor for us this campaign.

*Vert* - our most seasoned CB. We need his calmness against ManU. He will also help gel Toby with the rest of the defense. 

*Walker* - While I really like Trippier, I'm not sold on him displacing Walker as our starting RB just yet. Walker was arguably our best player against Real and tore the right side of the field up. 

*Lloris* (if fit) - One of the best keepers in the world. Obviously.

________________________

**Exclusions**

Mason - More on this below. But tl;dr, he's too short and won't be effetive against United's long-ball approach. Also not creative enough going forward.

Dembele - While I really like this new Dembele, I don't think it's right against United. I think he'll be the perfect CAM or CM against Swansea, but United is different. 

______________

**Strategy**

*Defensive*

I mentioned this in another comment, but I've watched all of ManU's pre-season friendlies in preparation to the first game, and they have rarely deviated from the long-ball style they played last year. 

I was at the PSG v. ManU game in Chicago and while they did move the ball up the field through the midfield, it was obvious that their most effective attacking mechanism was launching it.

The key difference this year is who is doing the launching. Last campaign it was Carrick or Herrara, both good players in their own right. Now, they have Bastian. And while he's not as fit as he used to be, the guy's foot is amazing. Combine that with Rooney's incredible off-the-ball movement and you have one heck of a combination. There were a number of times where Bastian put a ball right on Rooney's foot from half the field away. 

Thus, Alli over Mason. Alli is 6'2"". Mason is 5'10"". That extra 4 inches will be important, I think, in countering the long-ball. I would go for Dier, but he just seems too untrustworthy there for now. 

The other threat is a speed combination of Depay, Darmian, and Shaw. Walker and Rose will need their running shoes on because these guys were streaming down the line in every pre-season match. Depay is a tricky motherfucker. If you stay on him long enough, he'll give up the ball because he's not very strong; the problem is catching the little fucker. 

If you congest the midfield, they'll put it wide with Shaw and Darmain. Our back 4 + the midfield will have to be on their game. 

*Offensive*

The biggest thing for me will be creating space in the United final third. Their system leads to very little space and if we sit on the ball like we always do, it's going to be a parade of Vert and Toby passing between them. We either catch them on the counter or we drag Jones, Smalling or Shaw out of position and exploit. 

Hopefully Alli can be of use here as well. 

Kane will be marked, maybe even double-marked, for most of the game. Eriksen will be followed tightly by Morgan. The room that leaves should be enough for Chadli, Alli, and Lamela to exploit and create *something*.

null,null,rjolly,lfc68,,null,"Because he doesnt know how to judge players. I'm not going to just unfairly attack him but I think it is a fair criticism that he doesn't know how to judge players.

The players he signed for Liverpool were not Liverpool quality he judged Konchesky and Poulsen as Liverpool quality because Konchesky was a decent player for mid table clubs and Pulsen had been at a few decent clubs. He does it with England he will pick as many top 6 players as possible because he thinks if they are at big clubs they must be good. He is afraid of giving other players a go because he can't judge how good they are.

He has tried giving a few other players ago such as Delph, although he is now at City. But even that he can't get right because he has played Delph too much as he can't judge his ability. And he picked Vardy. He is trying to pick different players but picks someone average like Vardy

Remember when he put Cleverly on the standby list for the world cup? That was inexcusible. No matter which way you looked at it, there was no justification. Players such as Noble, Colback and Barry who all had a good season were left out. Barry was arguably behind Gerrard the best English midfielder that season yet he put Cleverly on the standby list. If he was going to pick someone shit he could literally have picked any shit midfielder England has and they would have been better than Clervely. It was unprofessional, disgraceful and inexcusible to pick Cleverly granted he didn't make the final squad. When he played Jones ahead of Clyne at RB he said people would be asking why Jones wasn't playing if Clyne had started. Which shows he doesn't  know how to judge a player. He picked Jones because he thought that was what was expected. He of course thought wrong no one would ask why Jones wasnt at RB

Also he is a bit stupid. There was a point last season well into the season where he had visited every premier league ground to watch players but didn't go to Swansea which seems a bit unprofessional especially since they have a few English players. It's even worse considering he went to watch Chelsea play a European game. Chelsea who have 2 English players and one is retired. Cahil didn't start that game either

null,null,BullshitSuperMan,null,null,null,"&gt; ""where there is property, there is great inequality"" and a proceeds to say ""“Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.”

That implies that inequality is ALWAYS a bad thing. It suggests that people who are poor (those lacking property) are poor through no fault of their own, which is very often not the case. Of course I accept that there are many people who live in unfortunate circumstances due to forces outside of their control, and this is why we need at least some sort of welfare state. However, welfare should be a safety net, not a charity for those who make bad life decisions. Unfortunately, it would be very difficult to distinguish between the ""deserving"" poor and ""undeserving"" poor, and so we have the system we have at the minute currently.  
The passage you quoted also suggests that a government that served no other purpose than to protect property rights only protects the rich, when in actual fact it protects the poor as well. It prevents the rich abusing their power/wealth to steal from the poor.  
One of the biggest criticisms of our current systems is the amount of tax avoidance that goes unpunished. People on the left suggest we raise taxes, and clamp down on businesses that avoid parting with their money. But nobody says how this can be practically achieved. Under our current system, the rich can quite easily move their ""multinational company"" from one place to another, thus avoiding tax altogether, if they do not like the higher rate. As a result, the higher tax rates do not affect the rich at all. Sure, they do not protect the rich, but they do not help balance the scales either. Higher taxes ultimately hit the middle classes in society, who cannot move their wealth as easily. This dissuades the middle classes from starting businesses, and creating jobs - slowing economic growth.  
My point is that a government that only protects property right, protects everyone, albeit not equally. By contrast, a government which taxes the rich harshly, does affect the rich at all, and hits the middle of society the hardest.  
&gt;the state is required for the markets to operate

Well, yes - the state is required to maintain security and public health, allowing the ""market"" to operate. It is not required for trade or business. It is not required to regulate the money supply or the interest rates. By saying the state is required for the market to operate is like saying the state is required for you to go to cinema - sure, the state needs to maintain order to you can enjoy the time you have for recreation, but it is not required for the actual act.  
&gt;but when the state is become increasingly privatized where is the money to fund the state coming from?

The private sector. If you privatise something, the private sector pays for it, the private individual buys it. Unless you are referring to the so called ""privatisation"" of the NHS, which isn't privatisation at all. It's called outsourcing. While the NHS remains free at the point of delivery, paid for from public funds, it has NOT been privatised. It doesn't matter if the health care is provided by a private company - that is not what privatisation means if the money to pay for it is coming from the state.  

&gt;You're argument about tax and the NHS etc is invalid, because these are the things we need to arguably run a successful healthy economy.

I don't see how the NHS contributes to a healthy economy, unless you mean it helps keep the workforce healthy, and therefore productive. If the latter argument is the case, I agree with you. We need an NHS. It is the most efficient way of providing citizens with health care, when in the right hands. However, my point in the my comment above was not that the NHS is bad. I was trying to show you how we don't live in a ""free market capitalist society"". The NHS is government intervention. The government is intervening in the health care market. It isn't a capitalist organisation because it is paid for from tax payer funds. The government does not respect property rights when taxing people, therefore we are not capitalist. I'm not saying taxation is bad - I'm saying we don't need more of it.  

&gt;You guys can't have t both ways, the free market needs to be regulated by a socialist government, and have some sort of social market economy like Germany to have any chance at succeeding

Why? Why, why why why? Why does the free market need to be regulated? Because it perpetuates inequality? You don't know that for sure, because we  don't live in a free market society.

ST: Kane

I think there are three **main** things to consider going into the opening game at a place like Old Trafford: Quality, History, Familiarness

1. Quality: United beefed up this summer, adding to an already impressive side. With DiMaria seemingly on the way out but players like Depay moving in, United looks more like a side that is going to have precision and speed in their arsenal. This is a tactical point.
2. History: OT has the history of being a hard ground to win away on. I don't care what the last two years have brung, that feeling still echoes around the ground and the fans still get behind their men to push forward. This is part of a psychological tactic point. 
3. Familiarness: United have brought in players who aren't used to each other yet, and one could argue this is *the perfect time* to go to Old Trafford. The players may have some friendly experience together, but they will be a much better side come GW8-9. Tactically, we have to take advantage of their cohesion (or any lack thereof). 

So, tactics:     
*I like Poch's tactics, granted it's a bit removed from the ethos of Spurs of old, but football is a different game now. I will embrace the double-pivot many of you think Poch is assembling even though I prefer to a dedicated person. Hence, I've dropped Bentaleb and Dembele in the midfield pairing. The reasoning here is that Mason is a good player, but he is also a player who isn't strong enough. I am preferring a slower Dembele who is instinctually smarter and can battle a bit more. Good for 60 minutes, bring on Mason to run down tired legs after. I'll break this all down. 

United XI:

                           De Gea

          Darmian  Smalling Rojo  Shaw

          Schneiderlin   Blind(Schwein)

                    Mata(herrera)    

       Pedro(if official)   Rooney   Memphis

This is a good looking side, to be fair. I don't see Schweiny being ready and I anticipate Blind stepping into a deeper role than Schneiderlin. Mata your 10 with Pedro if moved, Rooney up top and Memphis filling the LW role. Speed and confusion is going to be their bag come Saturday. 

Tactics Overview:     
Disrupt weaklinks, retain possession, and press only in our own half. Ideally, we take Rooney and Mata right out of the game by keeping them marked. Pedro and Memphis can play a sprint game against our FB pairing and see how they do in the PL. I am not confident they will be ready for the physicality or intensity of PL, and I think that's a weak link we need to attack. In their back four, Smalling and Rojo are the weak links as a pairing. Smalling is just so error prone to bonehead mistakes that Kane getting on the left, coming in to his right could be a deadly move. 

- Walker and Rose to sit and run from deep. CB's to stay tight, stay deeper and keep Rooney in front of their eyesight. Bentaleb and Dembele are going to have their work cut out for them with Mata, Blind and Morgan creating a triangle. I think people underestimate Blind as a deep player, but he is scary accurate and can put in a good defensive effort. MS is MS. He will be a bruiser and Dembele is going to have to work some magic with his feet. Eriksen to come deeper to remove Blind as a backwards pass option. 

Transition: 

- When lost: Drop behind ball, press at halfway. Kane to come deep and press CBs and try to force them to launch it up field to our taller CBs. 
- When won: Quick movement to wings. I believe Depay and Pedro* will be looking to impress and will be caught higher up the field, releasing Chadli and Lamela. What I wouldn't want to see is Rose/Walker go bombing up, but rather Eriksen creating an inside outlet that releases them into runs behind the LB/CB, or RB/CB channel. Smalling is particularly a bad turner. Get in.

null,null,Subotan,,Lizzite,null,"&gt;has not brought stability to Iraq and has probably honestly made things a lot worse.

This is contestable. Remember, from the initial date of the invasion, Iraqis subsequently went to the polls en masse three times in general elections to elect democratic-ish governments. By 2009 the insurgency/civil war was largely defeated, and Iraq notably remained quiet during the initial phase of the Arab Spring.

Iraq can be compared quite closely to Syria on this - both were authoritarian, Ba'athist and therefore nominally secular, sectarian states. During the initial phase of the Arab Spring Syria completely imploded, but Iraq remained stable until the combination of increasingly sectarian/pro-Iran rule by Maliki and the advance of ISIS into Iraq brought about the collapse of the Sunni elements of the Iraqi army last year.

I think it's reasonable to say that the invasion was a catalyst for the sectarian civil war which engulfed Iraq from 2004 through to 2009, peaking in 2006 - I wouldn't use cause personally as I think domestic factors especially the legacy of Saddam's Sunni supremacy and Iran's role were stronger. But ultimately, that war *was* won, and Iraq was stable with a democratic system for the first time. 

The big mistake was the American withdrawal and subsequent abandonment of Iraq, even as the rest of the Arab World was descending into chaos and Maliki danced more feverishly to his Iranian puppet strings. Historians will probably look on the invasion as a blunder - but Obama washing his hands of Iraq will be seen as an era defining catastrophe.

Naturally this apathy can be used as the reason for the lack of right and centre discussion but having been around as long as I have I know how the system works and I can't change it. 

What I've done here is bring attention to the circlejerking this sub has become. I have compounded the problem but as the numerous upvotes on this thread prove, either people are tired of hearing about Corbyn all the time or just found this a bit amusing. Unfortunately it is a low effort shitpost but then again I regard copy pasting the links of whatever Owen Jones has to say this week in the same way. 

I must have missed these broadly conservative posts. No doubt they were lost in the usual Guardian linkdrops. I could link to the numerous Guido Fawkes blogposts on C_o_r_b_y_n highlighting his dubious associations with terrorists or regimes that promote the violations of human rights but I don't believe they will be well received in this subreddit, given the status of GF as a rightwing mouthpiece. 

I like /r/unitedkingdom. As /u/Frankeh pointed out this sub used to be a quality community with usually strong content, and these days there are occasionally some fantastic one off posts. This is the exception rather than the norm however. I still come here out of habit but there's been a real shift in attitude recently, which I think has come out of the general election and Scottish referendum being held. As politics dominated the UK headlines, so too did this sub. Despite /r/ukpolitics existing, the overflow from election/referendum mania into this subreddit has resulted in it becoming the defacto main area for UK politics on reddit.

 I must admit I've actually entertained myself quite a bit by bringing /r/C_o_r_b_y_nJerk to the front page of this sub, apologies for the low effort and lack of discussion it provokes but I started this as a way of highlighting the ridiculous circlejerk that goes on over the man and am glad if others have been entertained by mocking the pro-Jeremy culture. 

Thank you for your words on my posts in /r/horseracing. They did take a lot of time, whereas you can imagine this thread didn't

This.

I alluded to this when explaining why Sherwood did better with Lambert's squad last season. Sherwood had nothing to fear. He could have played six up front and if we'd been relegated, I doubt anyone would have blamed him because the consensus was that we were going down anyway.

Equally, at Norwich, Lambert had nothing to worry about. They were almost expected to lose a lot of the time. We've never had that kind of thing at Villa. We don't expect to win all the time, but we're not really content with middling along (no matter what the stereotypes suggest). So we're more demanding in that sense -- what with the deep sense of pride in the club's hugely important history that we have as fans -- and I think Lambert was acutely aware of that.

Problem was that it appeared to affect him very strongly, mentally. He became afraid of taking those same risks he might have done elsewhere, the risks he took in the beginning... and it projected onto the players. As his confidence shrank, so did theirs. And frankly, their confidence wasn't exactly sky high when he got here, was it?

If you look back, you can see the gradual shift Lambert made from ambitious, risky decisions with youngsters to uninspired, supposedly ""safe"" decisions with veterans. He feared failure more than he desired success, perhaps.",null,0,null,1438781165,null,null,false,0,cts9l66,null,t3_3frpqs,null,null,null,t1_ctrchpq,null,null,null,1440294447,null,2,null,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

Did the war fuck Iraq up worse than Saddam did? The jury is out on that one. I'd wager Sunni Arabs would say yes, while Shia Arabs and Kurds would say no.

&gt;Hundreds of thousands died in the Iraq war

Ok, that's a bit I don't understand. Yes, hundreds of thousands of civilians died in the Iraq War, but extremely few of them were killed by the coalition; most of them were killed by terrorists from the other side of the sectarian divide. Shouldn't the blame for killing people in terror attacks fall to the terrorists rather than to the coalition?

&gt;and the 'democracy' that was installed in Saddam's place is laughable.

It's certainly a hell of a lot better than Saddam. It could be much better still, but one of the conditions for this bettering would be not having terrorist attacks from people who can't accept the idea of an Iraqi democracy.

&gt;So we should have been there forever?

Until the job was done and Iraq was able to defend itself alone.

&gt;What would happen is we would kill a bunch of civilians, and then ISIL would continue their genocide anyway.

Well no, or at least not in the conditions it is doing so now. ISIS is different from other terrorist groups in that it actually controls a territory and imposes its barbaric law inside it. If a halfway to modern military (could even be Turkey's) decided to strike at it, it'd be lost in a few days.

I dislike him as much as the next red, but he does reserve the right to make those kinds of decisions with more in mind than the better player. I do agree that Clyne should've been starting, but don't think it's completely beyond discussion. 

To answer the  OP, I think it's to do with the overall level that the players consistently play at. It's difficult to stand out in a team that isn't playing well, and mid-table and below teams don't tend to play well for particularly long spells. International football is already so sporadic, so international managers generally only want to call up players they intend to use long-term. The big exception to this is friendlies, where they probably want to give potential backup players/media darlings some minutes, both to prove a point, and to give them some sort of grounding in case they're needed later. 

Clyne admittedly isn't the best example of this, since Soton only finished one place below us though. Part of his reasoning will probably be though, that Soton having an off season could end up with getting relegated. Liverpool having an off season still includes us finishing higher than them after an exceptional one. If Soton finish mid-table, it's almost impossible for Clyne to look good as a fullback. If Liverpool get into the champions league, then just by being a regular Clyne will probably look a much better long-term bet.

In Gabby's case, if I were to guess, I'd say it's because he gets along with pretty much everyone at the club. Couldn't make him team captain because he probably won't play that often, and making a new guy your captain (especially if there's an established, popular figure in the dressing room) can be divisive.
