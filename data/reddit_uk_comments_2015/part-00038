null,false,Monztaa,lfcwfmm,,null,"So Rodgers, despite saying 'I can categorically tell you that Balotelli won't  be at Liverpool', wanted Balotelli? And that Balotelli is the complete opposite to what a typical Rodgers signing is? He cut off Remy last minute because Balotelli was available or was that because Remy failed a medical? The board forced Balotelli onto Rodgers because the transfer commitee themselves are compromised of people who are specialist in stats and figures rather than coaching credentials. I can't stress this enough. Balotelli is the opposite to what Rodgers wanted. He's static and doesn't press. He's also got mentality problems (admittedly he's matured). I can practically guarantee you that Rodgers didn't want Balotelli. He's so different from Rodgers' philosophy that it was surprising that he was even considered as someone to buy. It's clear that it was a panic buy and Rodgers was forced with Balotelli or nothing. And Lambert was involved in perhaps the best pressing team in the league last year under Pochettino. Lambert knows how to press. So does Sturridge. They know the principles of pressure. Balotelli doesn't because he wasn't taught how to and still isn't pressing either. Lambert is totally different from Balotelli in that regard.

You clearly don't understand Rodgers' method and coaching if you believe that pressing isn't key to his methods. You don't understand any of Rodgers' principles at all. Do you know how he bases his philosophy on space and pressure? Can you explain this to me then? It's not an excuse, it's fact. I even remember one distinct game in which Balotelli didn't shut down the lane and Henderson did instead. Afterwards, Henderson screamed at Balotelli for not pressing. Pressing has always started from the front for Rodgers. That's why Carroll was shipped out ASAP. Rodgers isn't blaming lack of goals for Balotelli not pressing, but make no mistake it's a fundamental part of our play. Balotelli isn't directly a problem for us not scoring goals. Indirectly, he is. It's how we tick. 

Unfortunately for you, I know what I'm talking about because I get paid for my opinion and advice and am an active coach. I know a good coach when I see one. Rodgers has got things wrong for sure. He shouldn't have upset the balance of the play and made any changes. And he shouldn't have persisted with certain players. But he's a very young coach and is learning all the time. But it's not all his fault. And if you can't see that the TC is also to blame then perhaps we should just end the conversation. I don't need to prove to you that I'm right. But some of the claims you make are factually wrong and nonsensical.

However, I think this is delving into things like why not make Superman, Superwoman? And Wonderwoman be Wonderman? 

They opted to make new opposite gender characters for each (except Wonderwoman?) of these characters. 

Why is changing the gender of this one fictional character so important? Why do the same people who advocate it fervently not push for other characters to have a gender switch?  The character was created as a male, why are people so interested in the change? 

I don't see how the longevity of the show is an objective qualifier for why the character should change genders. Why is Sherlock still a guy? that's an even older male character. What about Hercules?


Perhaps it is because I think of him as a super-hero, and his powers are intellect and regeneration. 

An alternate time traveler who happens to be a woman might or might not work, I don't know. River Song did quite well. Smart, Strong, Sassy, etc. 

Or why not focus on creating an original lead female character that we can all admire? I mean, River Song and the Doctor's daughter were automatic favorites for me. 

Also as a side point, do we know how Time Lords reproduce? Would the mythology be amended to say that at any point any time lord can be pregnant if they happen to regenerate into a female?

Your quite right and yes the fees are there online but are a lot less than off-line fees. Ebay for example listing fees are not very high and the commission shouldnt phase you so much as it's only paid post sale. 

I agree online marketing is not something you are going to learn overnight - it takes lots of time, reading, pratice etc. however all it costs is time. You don't have to spend a sh1t ton on online ads to get exposure - in fact we advise against this for SME's at the startup phase as you'll just sink money into google for little ROI. Being clever with your approach is best IMO.

I guess a large part of this is - is this a hobby or something you would like to make into a business? If it's a hobby then great sell at some markets, make friends and have fun.

What nonsense:

""The CCTV footage showed that while she was inside the kebab shop she was unsteady on her feet, at one point she fell over and landed on the floor. On the other hand, outside the kebab shop she could be seen eating pizza from a large box, although she was also seen to stumble, squat, lose her balance, and walk unsteadily. Indeed, she left her handbag in the shop. Based on this evidence, the prosecution case was that she was very drunk.""

...

""The complainant had no recollection of anything which took place after 3am. That extended to the fact that she and McDonald entered the hotel at 4.15am. The night porter described her as ""extremely drunk"". That reinforced the Crown's case based on the evidence of witnesses and the CCTV footage before she had arrived at the hotel.""

Also:

""After about half an hour McDonald left the hotel via the reception. He had a brief word with the night porter, telling him that he should look out for the girl in room 14 (the room in question) because she was sick. The applicant did not leave by the front door; he went out by an emergency exit. McDonald and the applicant met up outside and they returned to the applicant's home.""

So Mr McDonald would also seem to think that the victim was very drunk.

""The complainant said that her next memory was waking up in the hotel room at about 11.30am. She realised that she was alone. She was naked and had urinated in the bed. She had a headache and was confused. She reported the matter to the police.""

So she's seen on video stumbling about and falling over, the night porter described her as ""extremely drunk"", Evans' mate asked the night porter to 'look out' for the victim because she was ""sick"". To cap things off she wakes up ""confused"" having wet the bed all that is rather suggestive that she was indeed very drunk.

So do you propose the sex given to children at birth is based upon the results of a DNA tests? Because that would be very expensive and time consuming. Around one in a hundred births results in a child with indeterminate genitals. There are also people who don't react to testosterone/ oestrogen and who present entirely as female or male respectively. They may be XX or XY but absolutely everything about them would be male or female. 

I'd probably use terms relevant to what people have in their passports/ birth certificates (including if altered in line with the current UK law).

Results of brain scans of trans people show that their brains act in the same ways as people who conform strongly to one end of the binary. 

The current theory is, that the amount of some hormones which a foetus is exposed to in the womb affects how their brain develops. This can cause them to have more male or more female brains. The ubiquity of trans people makes me doubt this biological 'given line' really exists in a sense that provides useful debate in any other context than the medical profession. 

Trans women *are* women. Germaine Greer was cruel and obtuse in her comments, and they carry very little merit in the current debates surrounding Queer people and arguably most 3rd wave feminism.

null,false,cashrichhealthpoor,null,null,null,"Yeah, that's really my dilemma: if I'm looking only for security on this side of the portfolio, is there any reason today to buy gilts at the moment rather than higher yielding government-guaranteed options like (on the liquid side) NS&amp;I bonds at 1.25% and (on the illiquid side) 5 year bank bonds at 3%?  I don't think so but then I'm new to all this and probably missing something.

With investment grade corporate bonds you also keep the liquidity but there's no clear value advantage over gilts: a bit more yield for a bit more risk.

The Vanguard fund is interesting in principle but I can't see the 1.9%.  I can see a YTM of 1.6% as at end 2014 but fixed income prices have rocketed again since then so that's probably dropped a bit.  Once you also take off the fees, I'm not convinced it's going to come out a lot better than NS&amp;I (although of course NS&amp;I's rate might fall at any time).

The Vanguard fund also slightly bends Mr Hale's rules about 5 years or less and AA or better for defensive assets.  With an average AA- rating and 8.3 year maturity, I'm not convinced it's a lot safer than a 1-5 year GBP investment grade corporate bond fund yielding c. 2%.  I guess you're paying for the greater diversification (and it is an impressively straight line on the performance charts).

If I was aiming to avoid gilts (or government bonds in general) but still wanted some more inflation protection than I get just from equities, what did you think of the idea in current markets of adding a commodity element to the growth side?  Commodity futures funds are horrible and I would avoid them like the plague - there is a lovely study showing 89% of profits across 63 funds over a decade getting taken in fees - but I am tempted to add in, say, an oil &amp; gas index tracker and an agribusiness index tracker, given the proportion of global inflation that comes from oil and food.

Other than a commodity rebound, I see the most likely source of high future inflation in the UK as being another currency crash - but I'm less concerned about that specific risk as my equities will mainly be in a US-heavy global fund rather than being UK focused, giving me a good hedge.  If the UK economy itself starts inflating for reasons other than commodity price rises or a currency crash, the BoE will raise interest rates faster than expected so index-linked gilts still won't do brilliantly (although better than other GBP fixed income things of course).

The Santander account is great and yes, I will switch my current account to it - £40k is a small part of my portfolio but worth having.  In total I have about £900k for defensive assets - but say £650k of that is to buy a house in the relatively near term so that part has to stay in NS&amp;I for security and liquidity.  So there's around £250k left to invest properly on the defensive side (with a similar sum for the growth side).

I think I'm leaning towards something like:
* £40k in Santander current account @ 3%
* £85k in Bank of Baroda 5 year bond @ 3% (or split between two banks offering similar deals)
* £50k in a 1-5 yr investment grade corporate bond index ETF @ 2%
* £75k in NS&amp;I @ 1.25%

Then 80% of it is government guaranteed, 66% is liquid, and the average nominal yield is around 2.3%.

Then on the return engine side, I'm thinking of going for Hale's recommended mix but swapping out say 10% of the 75% in global equities for the two commodity funds.  (Or potentially taking 5% from equity and 5% from property.)  It feels like quite a lot to put in commodities but I've taken all the inflation protection out of the defensive portfolio.

What do you think?

Hardly.

""The CCTV footage showed that while she was inside the kebab shop...""

Which was ahead of the timeline of the CCTV at the hotel where she appears to have sobered up significantly.

&gt; ""The night porter described her as ""extremely drunk"".

Which is directly contradicted by the video evidence of her at the hotel.

&gt; So Mr McDonald would also seem to think that the victim was very drunk.

Being sick doesn't mean too drunk to give consent and McDonald testified that she was able to give meaningful and informed consent.

&gt; So she's seen on video stumbling about and falling over

On the earlier video, apparently she is seen this way. On the later video she is not.

&gt; the night porter described her as ""extremely drunk""

Which is directly contradicted by the hotel CCTV and all four witness statements. 

&gt; Evans' mate asked the night porter to 'look out' for the victim because she was ""sick"".

Being sick doesn't denote that she was too drunk to consent.

&gt; To cap things off she wakes up ""confused"" having wet the bed all that is rather suggestive that she was indeed very drunk. 

The girl in question [testified as to what she drank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Evans):

&gt; The woman, a 19-year-old waitress, said she had drunk two glasses of wine, four double vodkas with lemonade, and a shot of sambuca. As a result, she told police she ""felt tipsy but not out of control"".

null,false,bockers7,lfc99,,null,"&gt; Unfortunately for you, I know what I'm talking about because I get paid for my opinion and advice and am an active coach. I know a good coach when I see one.

This is what I'm talking about when saying I didn't want to give you my credentials bc I would sound like a try hard. It becomes a dick measuring contest over the internet.. I played youth soccer at Atletico PR, where Fernandinho came from.. I didn't have the talent/speed necessary to go to the next level and moved to the US in my teens to play in college, which I did at a very good school.. You are beyond retarded if you think I don't know what I'm talking about.. Whatever your opinion is, doesn't make it better than mine. We are clearly from two different school of thoughts. You take things wayyyy too literal and don't read between the lines when it comes to Rodgers comments. Coaches use the media to push their players. I guarantee you we keep Balo for another year. 

And I agree that Balo has to press, which I stated. What I;m saying that it isn't the reason why he hasn't been successful in our shirt. There are numerous other reasons why he hasn't been banging in goals, pressing is not one of them. We are simply awful attacking team at the moment, and it starts all the way at the back. Idk how you don't agree to this?.. Sure pressing makes us tick, but if that's the case why was Stevie playing CDM? He is anti-press.. Or why is his AM now? So bc we press is why he put Hendo out in the wing where he's absolutely useless? 

Rodgers method isn't some sort of magical formula. He is utter shit in defense and has been his whole career. His attack tends to be free flowing but we haven''t been able to put 5 passes together until the four games ago.. He has not been good this season, stop trying to defend him, it's a mute point. I really like Rodgers and I agree that he has the chance to become a great LFC manager, but it doesn't change the fact that he has been utter shit this season. For instance this last game, why did Stevie play the full match? Why wasn't Lallana brought on? Why did Glen go into the middle? What about zonal marking can he not get through the players heads? Why did Sterling start as a lone fucking striker when we knew we needed to nick in a goal... 

But wait, lets just use some of your past comments to refresh some of your old opinions.. 

&gt;I also do think that people jump on the 'Balotelli is lazy' bandwagon when everything is going wrong and he's been given an awful amount of criticism. Yes, he hasn't scored but it's not like he hasn't tried his best.

You yourself defended him from being lazy yet while arguing with me you called him lazy... how does that make any sense?

It makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways.  I like him, it's not so much about the name of the player being important for me as a fan, I'm more concerned about his ability to play his usual game while playing for a club Liverpool's size.  If he can handle the pressure I think he'll do great.  

Liverpool only don't benefit now in that they don't get to select him at the weekend (assuming Sturridge won't be starting yet), which is a shame, but, like with Origi, if it gets the deal done, and at a much better price, while also protecting the other club and the player (they will play another half season of first-team football before arriving), then it seems to me good business.

39. The combination of FA314, FA420 and FA720 would implement what is effectively a complete ban on growing, importing or consumption of GM food in the UK. The motives for this are largely on grounds of safety. However, this goes against the scientific consensus of numerous industry, academic, national and international organizations of scientists (short summary: https://std3.ru/13/88/1377358653-13880403dfaeeae97f36b502869c1059.jpeg ) This directly contradicts FA120 (d), which states you will base your policies on evidence-based research.

40. FA710 states that GM does not make farming more efficient. However, GM crops are capable of vastly increasing yields per acre, reducing land use. Have you actually carried out research on this subject, or just made a knee-jerk reaction of a policy?

41. The infamous ""Terminator Gene"" would solve the criticisms of GM you give in FA711 A, B and E, by preventing the propagation of the genetic modification in the wild. Would your party accept this solution?

42. FA711 C is clearly a reference to Roundup Herbicide, and is based on research by widely discredited scientist Giles-Eric Séralini. Why is this part of your policy?

43. The assertion made in FA712, that GM has harmed poor communities where it has been introduced, is not backed up with any evidence.

44. FA713 states that insufficient research has been done on GMO safety. This is the main motive for your proposed moratoriums. Here is a list of about 600 studies on GMO safety: http://genera.biofortified.org/viewall.php .  If this is not sufficient research, what is? So far, it seems that no level of evidence will change your policy.

45. Overall, it is clear your GM policy is not based upon scientific evidence. Why do you feel it's acceptable for you to criticize other parties for ignoring the scientific consensus on Climate Change, while you ignore the scientific consensus on GM?

46. Your party will encourage growth of the Organic food industry, mostly because you support use of organic fertilizers and chemicals over conventional ones. However, several chemicals used routinely in organic farming (and used because no other viable organic candidates exist) are far more dangerous and environmentally damaging than conventional chemicals. Rotenone is extremely toxic to insects and marine life. Copper Sulphate will accumulate permanently in soil and, at high concentrations, make it incapable of supporting plant life. Why do you support and industry that requires these sorts of chemicals to function, over the far safer conventional industry?

**Health**

47. Home birth is known to have a far higher rate of death than hospital birth. However, your HE303 policy will act as an endorsement of this practice, leading to the deaths of large numbers of babies and mothers. Does your party consider these deaths an acceptable price to pay in fulfilling your principles?

48. HE311 iii, on first inspection, seems fine. However, there is a risk that businesses will be unable to prevent women from breastfeeding in conditions that risk them, their child or those around them. Will any exceptions to this policy be implemented?

49. Requiring government-employed health workers to carry out health policy avocation, as stated in HE319, is potentially a source of propaganda for the ruling party if they are required to advocate policies that the ruling party favours. How would you prevent this happening?

50. HE325 states that you consider ME/CFS to have a strong environmental factor. However, the pathophysiology of ME/CFS is unknown. Why have you asserted a specific cause of ME/CFS despite insufficient evidence for this?

51. H326 covers regulation of 'natural' and 'alternative' medicine. Will these regulations do the sound thing and implement a complete b

52. H330 states that you will not allow the introduction of Novel compounds that don't have significant advantages over existing drugs. However, novel compounds have uses in cases where people often experience different side effect severity between the original drug and it's novel compounds, meaning they have their uses even if not strictly better. Why would you restrict them despite this?

53. In HE334 you state that a ban on blood donation applied to bisexual and homosexual men. This in incorrect; it applied to men who had sex with men in the past. Not all bisexual and homosexual men have had sex with men. Either you are unaware of this subtle difference, or you are making concerning assumptions about the sexual lives of homosexual and bisexual men.

**Industry**

54. Your criticism of the finance and service sectors in IN103 is at odds with your de-industrialization policy in IN210 - a shift away from industry would represent a shift towards finance and service sectors.

55. IN628 states that you will require 40% of the the board at all companies to be Women. However, because this does not come with a requirement that 40% be Men, this would be discrimination in the legal system and contradicts RR207, which states that you oppose discrimination by gender.

**Peace and Defence**

56. PD205 states that nuclear weapons are disproportionate to any threat. Does this mean nuclear weapons are disproportionate to other nuclear weapons?

57. Have you analyzed potential threats to the UK following reduction in military strength, abandonment of NATO (PD513) and nuclear disarmament. PD302 appears to only consider threats to us in the context of our current military power, not with the level of military power you intend to bring us to.

58. How will you enforce PD400 without threats of military action, since military action would be required if diplomacy cannot enforce it.

**Rights and Responsibilities**

59. Since we do not perform military conscription, I do not see what use RR403 has. Conscientious Objection is as simple as not joining the military.

60. The second right listed in RR405 is so vague as to be meaningless.

61. RR501 is redundant since that law has already been changed.

62. RR502 implies that you reject asexuality, by asserting that young people will feel either heterosexual or homosexual attraction, or both, but not neither.

63. RR503 may need exceptions for work in pornography or brothels, where someone's sexuality would directly impede on their ability to carry out their work.

**Science and Technology**

64. For once, this is a policy I feel the greens don't go far enough on. ST221 states that all publicly funded clinical trials must publish results. However, why not extend this to private research by requiring that medical trials be registered before they are carried out, so that they can be made to publish results? This would reduce a source of bias where those who carry out trials favour publishing results that are 'interesting' and will often not publish results which support the null hypothesis. 

65. ST331 states that new equipment should avoid being made obsolete. The only way to do this would be to eliminate research carried out by Intel, Nvidea, AMD and similar companies that lead to the improvements in computing power that make new equipment become obsolete.

66. ST370 describes giving technological aid to the 3rd world. Does benign technology transfer include the GMO crop Golden Rice, designed to deal with vitamin A deficiency?

**Philosophical Basis of the Green Party**

67. Does PB101 hold any purpose other than to strawman the beliefs of your opponents?

68. PB109 blames people's need for love as a basic need. How will you meet this need, given that humans may reject loving someone for a variety of reasons that would be justified easily?

69. Can you demonstrate that the assertion made in PB110, that exploitation of the environment is caused by a lack of basic needs being met, as opposed to just being a prerequisite of meeting basic needs?

70. PB411 suggests that supporters of measuring wealth in monetary units believe that human labour is the main source of wealth. However, the only branch of Economics that still believes this sort of thing is the Heterodox branch of Marxian economics.

71. PB420 states that economic growth is finite because of finite resources. This is not the case, as economic output does not necessarily mean consumption of resources. An idea can have definable value (and grow the economy) despite requiring 0 resources. Therefore, infinite economic growth is possible without infinite resource consumption.

72. This is going to be a very hypothetical scenario. PB431 implies we should avoid researching certain technologies. However, even if civil society rejects this, groups opposed to it may not. If they carry out research into these areas and the rest of society does not, we may find ourselves powerless to stop any negative application they may have developed.

73. PB502 makes unreasonably negative accusations about your political opponents.",null,0,null,1422579318,null,0,false,0,co583ee,null,t3_2u58oh,null,t1_co583ee,null,t3_2u58oh,null,null,null,1424315653,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

null,false,JustAhobbyish,null,null,null,"&gt; Saying they haven't got a manifesto out yet does not invalidate the aims that the Green party is pushing for. UKIP haven't got a manifesto out but people still judge their apparent policies. Their leader has not denied any of the claims made about their approach to welfare and the like, just said ""wait until the manifesto to come out"". That's just plain not good enough for a leader of what is becoming a significant Westminister party.

I agree with you on this idea we should not be judging any party until the manifesto comes out. Only policy we know for sure is leaving the EU for UKIP.  Giving credit to the Greens and UKIP for being open about policy discussions.  UKIP saying it had discussions on insurance style NHS system. 
Already know to a point the general direction for most parties. 

&gt;280bn has been the figure floated around for this. A ""progressive income tax system"" would have to almost double the level of tax taken in from income tax alone. A doubling of everyone's current tax band, pretty crazy stuff. The rich would run well before implementation.

Poorest households pay the most tax when you factor indirect taxes number comes at around 50%, with top 10% of households paying 35%. Scandinavian nations have a far more progressive tax system not suffering from a major lack of high earners. Rebalance of the tax system is required, Greens idea is making sure everybody has enough money and with more people working on top. UK has had a decline in the number of people working as a percent of the work force.  Japan has started to look at increasing the number of women in the workforce. 
Need to look for some studies or ideas on how people would make the tax system more progressive.  Not seen anybody say that a bad idea apart from a couple newspapers. 

&gt;I've literally just posted an article on Russian planes causing trouble for UK air traffic within the last 10 minutes. I don't know why people think that war or threat of war is somehow over or done with. The world is not a pleasant place where people get along, just look at the middle east crisis at the moment. Are we to let ISIS capture and enslave countless more women and children?
The thing is with war in the modern age is that it moves so fast. If there's no resistance an army can be across European countries within the day. We're at a lower risk of war than during the Cold War but we still have a risk nonetheless. I worry that the coming decades will resemble that of the 1930's where Britain scaled back its military significantly due to the national debt and France paid the price.

Russia wants another cold war and rest of world does not care or even in the mood. Ukraine was mishandled due to a disjointed EU policy. 
Geopolitics of the world is changing with the balance of power moving towards the asia.   Middle east is being reshaped can only be solved by the arab states which sadly don't want to work together. 
Risk of war is no longer a nation but a rogue group with arms over a government.  
Having a full scale army in the current world does not make much sense smaller quicker response units do. I worry more about the EU being ripped apart from politics failing over war. 

&gt;I see. Not enough money through taxation so just print off money.

Commercial banks create most of the money in the economy.  Monetary policy does not replace fiscal policy. You don't need to wait for taxes to come in before spending money. 

&gt;They have clearly come out and said they want either zero growth or negative growth. This is patently untrue.

null,false,Aygers,lfc99,,null,"I'll elaborate:

Suarez had amazing quality and potential from a young age, even if he had disciplinary problems in equal measure. Either way teams saw something more in him and he moved from from one club to the next relatively quickly. In about three years he moved from Uruguay's Nacional to the Dutch Groningen and then to Ajax. Groningen went after him after only scouting one of his matches. That happens very rarely, if ever.

Sturridge was also tipped for great things. He made his breakthrough at Man City and impressed there enough to be offered a chance to join a bigger club (at the time). I'm not entirely certain why he wasn't offered more opportunity at either City or Chelsea and one could argue that he was in the spotlight even more because he was a young and exciting English striker at a time where there simply weren't many quality English youngsters coming through. He made a career with the burden of expectancy and pressure while being able to exploit and develop his talents.

Danny Ings has made a fine career so far. I don't have any intention to belittle him or his achievements. With all do respect however he simply never was considered in similar terms like the previous duo. It's true, he had more competition in his generation than Sturridge and it's possible to argue that the environment is also more challenging for Ings to succeed in compared to Suarez. But on the simplest of criteria, if there really was that much to Danny Ings would he have stayed at Burnley for so long? (with all respect for Burnley, fact is that big teams come for desirable young players with quality very quickly and with wallets wide open).

Danny Ings has talent and has experience. He holds potential and some proven quality, specially in a lower league. At the same time he was simply never thought of or rated as highly as Suarez and Sturridge were at a similar age. I'm intrigued by Ings and I rate him as a professional, based on what little I've seen of him. I think he has a long way to go however and a lot less credit compared to the other two strikers, when they were at a similar age.

You can have an XY that has developed as female due to an inactive [SRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testis_determining_factor) gene variant. Even rarer are XX males where the SRY gene has crossed over to an X chromosome.

And then you have aneuploidy where the sex chromosomes are XXY or XXXY or XXYY or some other variation.

You could instead say, okay, let's just test for a known good SRY gene and base the sex on that. But that gene is only the initial trigger for sex differentiation, there's a whole cascade of biological molecular machinery that makes it happen. So there are many things that can fail to work as expected during development, due to genetic variants or the foetal environment.

Because of all that sometimes the genitalia develops in an unusual way, maybe the opposite of what you might expect from the genetics, or some intersex condition. And the brain develops later on in pregnancy so can be influenced differently as well - you can end up with, for example, a typical male brain and the rest of your body looking female, or vice versa.

However, my comment on doubling the tax bands is in direct reference to income tax alone paying for a citizen's income.

Ideologically I am opposed to the idea of massive, crushing taxation just to fund people who may not necessarily even be working.

&gt;Risk of war is no longer a nation but a rogue group with arms over a government. Having a full scale army in the current world does not make much sense smaller quicker response units do. I worry more about the EU being ripped apart from politics failing over war. 

It's easy to say that you just need smaller response units to deal with international threats in this day and age. Consider though that to launch a proper response worth a damn we basically need to send our own carrier group to an area in order to project power. If we are to maintain any sense of force projection we will at the least need to commission the two carriers we are planning on building and fielding in the coming years.

I mean how small is a ""smaller quicker response unit""? I would place the smallest unit as the brigade level and you still need a considerable logistics chain with all the protection that needs to take place to protect such a chain. Ultimately a brigade in field will take maybe ten to twenty times the manpower alone to just keep it fully operational in any given area of the world.

Production of military goods takes a couple of months. Training to western standards but especially British standards takes even longer. I commented on the speed of modern warfare being very quick. In order to effectively even stand a chance against foreign aggression we do require a decent sized army in the field at all times. This is a regrettable but necessary aspect of our militaries.

The Green's wish to end our armed forces as any kind of threat, even to weaken them beyond a light defensive force. If a major crisis occurred a hostile power could land and take the country very quickly. We'd have no nuclear weapons, no air force, navy or ground forces. Our shores could be landed on without resistance and paratroopers could fall from the sky with the ease of a training exercise. Naturally the Greens do not want gun ownership too so the civilians would not be able to resist an occupation. In such an event we would be little more than pawns for other powers to play with. Fortunately and for all its faults, Westminster is fully aware of these dangers and so we of course have a competent set of armed forces. 

&gt;You don't need to wait for taxes to come in before spending money. 

I would greatly prefer if this was the case, or at the least something this country approached. The national debt is of great concern, particularly when people wish to raise spending as if we can afford to spend forever. If the national debt was £0, we would have an extra £47bn to pay for the NHS.

Not to mention an unpopular Prime Minister threatening to Shirt Front Vladimir Putin in a vague attempt at using a colloquialism he probably didn't understand.

The additional problem was that the Ukrainian Army launched an offensive in the area around the crashsite shortly after it came down and prevented Australian and Dutch Aircrash Investigators from going into the area.

&gt; How much would it cost approximately to ask a solicitor to send a letter asking for a partial refund?

Solicitors fees vary according to how good they are, but you're not looking for an expert here.

A wind turbine can only be used when winds are 4-15 m/s so only work for 75-80% of the time.  This isn't a issue, all power plants shut down for maintenance etc. 

Bad news is Wind turbines are affected by Betz Law, which states the maximum you can ever get out of open wind turbine use if 59%.  That is a real world, maximum efficiency under optimum conditions 59%.  In reality, if the windspeed decreased by half, your energy output decreased by a factor of 8. 

When in operation each wind turbine will typically do only 20-30% of it's rated output.  The biggest Wind turbine in use in the world, is 8MW, companies are working on 10MW for the new generation.  

If you have a wind turbine rated at 10MW, it's actual energy output is only going to be 2MW or 3MW of real useable electricity when in use, which is going to be about 70-85% of the time (of course this depends on being in ideal optimum conditions).

Lets say its in the perfect spot where it generates 3MW of power every hour for 85% of the year (310 days) Thats 22,338 MW from a single turbine in absolute optimum conditions.

Nuclear, biggest power plant in the world, comes in at 7965 in Japan.  Nuclear Power plants also generate electricity 90% of the time in new plants (24/7).

Taking those assumptions it gives us 62,796,060 MW.  Over 2,811 wind turbines would have to be installed in absolute optimum conditions in order to even match a single nuclear power plant.

That is also ignoring the basic fact that you cannot store Electricity well, This is why Nuclear is best option.  You can increase or decrease output depending on the grids requirements at a whim.  Wind you're entirely dependent on the wind to increase it's energy  (Unless of course you build so many Wind Turbines you constantly have 10-20% shut down at any time so you can increase it that way (depending on the wind is still useful) ).


Sorry but Wind Farms are not ""Safer, Cleaner, Cheaper"" 

Safer is debatable, There has been 33 Deaths in the UK due to Nuclear Power (In 1957 at Seafield)

In 2011 alone, Wind turbines killed 14 people.  

Cleaner, Again based on Co2 output including building and mining Nuclear and Wind are comparable and Solar is twice as polluting as Nuclear or Wind.

Cheaper? Not according to Government experts and studies.  Building a Nuclear power plant is cheaper than any other form of Renewable or Low Carbon Emitting source.

I'll tell you what a republic means to me. The current Irish President grew up in poverty. His parents were unable to support him and his brother so they were sent to live on his uncle's farm at a young age. He worked as a waiter in England in order to fund his college education. He came from nothing, yet was able to work his way up to the official top post of his country.

Our previous President comes from Belfast. As a Catholic, she was treated as a second-class citizen in her homeland, and when the Troubles broke out loyalist gangs drove her family from their home. And yet, decades later, she was the first citizen of Ireland, and she had the pleasure of inviting the Queen (technically her head of state when she was growing up) to her country and they stood beside one another as equals.

I find powerful symbolism in both those stories. They're positive egalitarian messages that can inspire children about the nature of democracy. Indeed, when I was growing up it was nice to know that there were no barriers preventing me from becoming head of state some day. And even though that will almost certainly never happen, I can still take satisfaction from the fact that I get to take part in the democratic decision of who gets that role.

But that kind of writing is beyond the skill of the Doctor Who writers. Neither Moffat nor Davies could carry the transformation of the Doctor into a woman as anything more than a gimmick. Moffat has a talent for clever dialogue and ham-fisted plot twists but he can't do character development to save himself and he doesn't have the attention to detail to manage anything but the most superficial of series arcs.

Without a genuine character-centric motivation and sensitive exploration of issues of gender the Doctor becoming female would just be hugely polarising and ultimately destructive to the franchise.

Why do people want a female Doctor? Can't the same narrative goals be achieved through a different female character? Someone like River Song could easily stand as an equal partner to the Doctor. There have been times in the history of Doctor Who where the Doctor himself was little more than a MacGuffin or a framing device and strong, personable companions drove the narrative.

null,false,L41r,null,null,null,"&gt;I wouldn't call it dumb per se. It's an idea that a good writing team with vision and a delicate touch could potentially pull off. If you had the strength of writing in Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad you might be able to achieve it.
But that kind of writing is beyond the skill of the Doctor Who writers. Neither Moffat nor Davies could carry the transformation of the Doctor into a woman as anything more than a gimmick. Moffat has a talent for clever dialogue and ham-fisted plot twists but he can't do character development to save himself and he doesn't have the attention to detail to manage anything but the most superficial of series arcs.


Those are rather unfair assertions. Moffat's plot twists aren't objectively 'clumsy' and the claim he cannot do character development is simply untrue – Rory, for example, went from wimp to awesome. And the attention to detail he has is fantastic – he's picked up on decades-old plot threads and successfully pulled off intricate plot arcs. Also, *regeneration* is a gimmick. That doesn't make it bad.

&gt; Without a genuine character-centric motivation and sensitive exploration of issues of gender the Doctor becoming female would just be hugely polarising and ultimately destructive to the franchise.


That is simply untrue. They wouldn't have to do an in-depth character study and exploration of issues pertaining to gender – they could just treat the Doctor's new gender as a fact and be done with it. You seem to feel as if the Doctor's having changed gender would need to be the focus of the show for ever series featuring that incarnation, but that's simply untrue.

Making a female Doctor wouldn't magically improve the portrayal of women on the show, there are already plenty of strong women on Doctor Who and the weaknesses that do exist are flaws in the writing, not the lack of important female characters.

If I were a woman I imagine would rather have a authentically female role model than to co-opt a male role model. Surely women don't have to have the male role on the show to be portrayed as equal?

You might argue that transgender people would appreciate having a Doctor who changes gender, but I doubt the writers have the appreciation and writing skill necessary to highlight transgender issues with sufficient nuance and sensitivity. I'm pretty sure that the Doctor's regeneration is not an appropriate vehicle for exploration of transgender issues, although it's not for me to say.

The main thing, in my opinion, is that it's not a problem most people can see.  It's not on their doorstep.  It's not their kids.  It's not even the kids of anyone they know.  So...  Oh, sure, it's enough to generate some ire when they read the newspapers, but really no one gives a fuck.

With the police, social services, the council and the sort...  The public sector is over-worked and under-funded, but this **isn't** the core problem.  Under New Labour target driven management went through the roof.  It's management by spreadsheet with neither intelligence, nor compassion guiding it.  And the thing that cements the problem into place is that senior managers are addicted to good news.  

The head of HMRC announces more tax yield than ever, but actual tax paid falls.  The NHS announces that they reduced waiting lists, but you can't actually book an appointment to see your GP.  The government claims it has successfully **slashed** benefits, but total benefits spending goes up.  These things are the result of this form of management and dealing with anything complicated is to be avoided, because it doesn't feed that success.

The fear of seeming racist thing *does* exist.  I can tell you from experience that ten years ago it was entirely de rigueur to make accusations of racism if your taxes were being enquired into and you weren't white.  Even if it didn't stick, it took a load of time and resource away from looking at you closely, so tactically it was absolutely the way to go.  You could be, well, 'whiter than white' but if someone calls your manager and claims you're a racist in the public sector and your working life isn't going to be much fun for some time.

Finally, on vigilantism...  If you remember the riots that followed the shooting of Mark Duggan, the rioters and looters were given really severe sentences.  You have to understand that the rioting and looting was opportunistic and had very little to do with Duggan.  (There's a pretty good argument to the effect that people with no investment in the society around them will resort to this much more readily.)  Now, a lynching (if done swiftly) is probably viable, but it's not something that people are organised or psychologically up for. Rioters driven by this, even if they didn't resort to looting, wouldn't be portrayed as justified.  They would be described as violent, racist, thugs.  Last time the police were heavily criticised for not breaking out the hoses and rubber bullets, so expect to see them on day two of the next riot in the UK.

I'm just saying that people should not look down on these highlights because they are goals Ings scored in the Championship. Quality goals are quality goals. 

Very few people had heard of Phillipe Coutinho when he joined Liverpool and felt he wouldn't be able to adapt to the premiership due to his size. Ings is actually showing some very good potential in the league right now and he's young so why are we so quick to hate this signing? My point is that we shouldn't be bashing on this signing because he's not a Lacazette or an Icardi. Sometimes the best signings can be diamonds in the rough.

null,false,L41r,null,null,null,"&gt; I think the prevailing view is the appearance of new incarnations is more subconscious than random. Timelords that identify as male regenerate as male; timelords with a more fluid gender identity may change their gender.

As a general rule, that might be the case, but the Doctor hasn't got definite control over *any* aspect of regeneration.

&gt;There are plenty of female characters on the show, many of whom are very much the Doctor's equal. If inclusivity is the goal I would favour bringing back River Song and emphasising that she's very much the Doctor's equal.

All of whom are supporting characters. *The Doctor* is always going to be front and centre of *Doctor Who*.

&gt;""Because you can"" is not necessarily a good idea for a controversial change to a show. I'm pretty sure that all the most popular changes to Doctor Who were done for storytelling or pragmatic reasons, not just because. Daleks can fly because it makes them more of a threat.

That's not the case.

I'll grant that Rory did develop well as a character but he's the exception. Moffat's writing was admittedly much better in his first season but he has gone downhill considerably since say ""A Good Man Goes to War"". I don't think he's a bad writer I just think he's a bad showrunner and maybe he overworks himself. I think he would be perfectly fine writing episodes with someone else running the series.

The way regeneration is handled on the show illustrates how a plot device can be so much more than just a gimmick. Successive Doctors have had some of their strongest character moments as they contemplate their mortality approaching their regeneration—or later as they come to terms with their identity post-regeneration.

These are some of the greatest moments of Doctor Who. Who can forget Tennant's ""I don't wanna go""? Contrast that with how Matt Smith left us. We're told it's hundreds of years fighting on Trenzalore, but but we don't feel it. He just looks and acts older. He's given a bunch more regenerations but you'd blink and miss that plot point. It's not something he wants, asks for or cares about. We get the concept, we intellectually realise it's important but we don't feel its importance. We should have had half a season of the Doctor suddenly realising that it was his final regeneration and paralysed by fear that he was about to die permanently.

If Moffat wrote the Doctor's regeneration as a woman we'd understand that the Doctor is now a woman, but we wouldn't know why. We wouldn't feel what that means to her. We'd probably have a quick joke about some new parts on the chest and some parts missing between the legs and that would be that.

If it doesn't mean anything for the Doctor to change into a woman, then it's just a gimmick. Regeneration *means something* to the Doctor; that's why it's not just a gimmick. The Daleks' unquenchable hatred *means something* to the Doctor, that's why they're such a good enemy.

All I'm saying is that if the Doctor's going to become a woman, it should be in service of some greater character story and not just because ""why not"". I don't think Moffat or any Doctor Who showrunner so far has it in them to pull that off.

A good actor. Some of my favorite british shows I watch because of the actresses in them. I don't think there is any reason to believe a good actor can't be found.

The cultural background of the doctor. While I don't think an American doctor would destroy the show I feel like it is an iconic role and seeing the doctor with an American accent would be strange.

My one concern is that the female characters in Doctor who are as deep as a puddle.

Yes, his personality and demeanor differs slightly, but I think of it more like a change of clothes; you act differently when you're in a suit and tie than when you're in jeans and a Tshirt or in sweats lounging on the couch, but you are still the same person with the same thoughts.

Introducing a female Doctor at this point is the human equivalent to gender reassignment surgery.

&gt; 11 ... Within the Council, **we found no evidence of children’s
social care staff being influenced by concerns about the ethnic origins of suspected
perpetrators when dealing with individual child protection cases**, including CSE. In
the broader organisational context, however, there was a widespread perception that messages conveyed by some senior people in the Council and also the Police, were
to 'downplay' the ethnic dimensions of CSE. Unsurprisingly, frontline staff appeared
to be confused as to what they were supposed to say and do and what would be
interpreted as 'racist'. From a political perspective, the approach of avoiding public
discussion of the issues was ill judged.

Fans used to Tennant and Smith and their penchant for tears and emotional outbursts and ready affections seem to have a tough time letting that go and turning to a Doctor who has finally stopped running from his own history (which is very long) and who has chosen an older face as a message to himself: you're not a dashing young beaux, you're an Ancient Time Lord with some grim experience behind you!

Emotion for this Doctor is frightening; he probably associates warm feelings and touchy-feely behavior with losses of Rose, Amy, etc., and with awful events that tore him up at the time, and he's not having that again if he can help it (and that's behavior in life, not good or bad writing).  Distance is his protection; coolness insulates him from grief and mourning.

But many times in series 8 he's shown deep emotion, e.g., when the dinosaur burns and he is desolated that he couldn't get her home as he just promised (and he's still in a the midst of a huge bout of renovation shock at the time); on the beach after ""Mummy"", when he states explicitly to Clara that it's not true that he behaved ""heartlessly"" on the train, only that he made the best of a bad hand; and did people somehow miss his entire conversation with CyberDan in ""Death in Heaven"", admitting to deep shame over the many deaths caused by the Doctor's own travels?  Look more, and listen carefully, Batmenic365, and you'll find many more glimpses of very strong emotion in this Doctor, and his efforts (sometimes humor, sometimes anger, or a demand for action) to seal that emotion up before anyone can get a grip on it.''

The Doctor is certainly at a stage where he feels guilt for having led people he'd come to care about into dangerous adventures that have not just hurt but at times destroyed them, and some followed him because -- they found his youthful good looks and energy attractive.  He's no longer using that kind of face, or letting himself be drawn close to his human contacts, hoping that holding them at a distance will protect them -- and also protect himself from the guilt of being responsible for what happens to them because of hanging around with him.  And older face, a more reserved manner, make him less of a magnet to susceptible followers, at least in his mind.

Of course, this is a very tricky strategy, since the figure of the older, distant, often unapproachable man of mystery and power is by definition attractive in human cultures.

But, as Clara is addicted to throwing off the bonds of normal modern life and going adventuring in space, the Doctor is also addicted -- to human company, among other things, so he's not going to escape this dilemma that easily, is he?

 I'd be fine with a female doctor if it's done well. I think the over all ""controversy"" is silly. People don't like change.

I just prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt and not jump to assuming people are sexist.

As you said the points people brought up are legitimate points. As for ghostbusters I haven't seen anything about it really. Personally I don't think they should reboot ghostbusters period. 

The thing about nerd culture is, as I have observed is they don't like change. They want to preserve precious memories. Rebooting something always goes over with a negative view. Not sure if you are a trekkie but many people were not happy with the idea of a reboot.

While they may be focusing on the fact ghostbusters has a female cast, I'd be willing to bet if it were an all male cast they would find something else to complain about, be it the director, the writing, or the special effects used.

I'd be more willing to believe it's people not wanting change of something they have fond memories of over that of a sexist attitude.

I'm not denying there are sexist attitudes. I just doubt, in nerd culture it's primarily about women, and more about change and reboots in general. 

Another prime example of this would be Jurassic Park. The reboot has already been torn apart online from what little we know about it. It's the change that people don't like. They put movies or shows they love on a pedestal, wrapped in plastic and behind bullet proof glass. It's perfect the way it is. Don't touch it. That's the attitude.


&gt;There is nothing wrong in bringing up any of your points but the discussions should flow in the direction of fixing any issues that could get in the way of a female doctor, not using them as an excuse to dash the idea to the curb.

You have to start the discussion somewhere. If you want a female doctor then find people talking about these points and confront them with answer to flow the conversation in the direction you want. Otherwise what is the point in the first place?

Allen is too small to be a proper DM. He's too slow to link defense to attack. He has limited vision and I've probably seen (exaggeration to come) him make a total of twenty passes forward in his whole career.

All that said, I think Allen IS a player, unlike say Borini, who would actually benefit from being in a different system. But much like Andy Carroll, I think the issue is that system is never going to be employed by any top side. So sure Big Andy does well with the ball being hoofed to him. But teams that hoof it don't win the title. 

What we gain from accommodating Allen is minimal in comparison to what we gain just by virtue of leaving him out.

I dislike the term creator being used here to imply something.

I don't particularly mind characters who change gender in media, but it just seems like blatant social justice nonsense rather than an interesting story point with regards to Doctor Who

I mean you could have a riff on all the female companions, and have the doctor team up with some online game addicted nerd (maybe cybermen get involved in online gaming and this guy helps out), and then halfway through the season the doctor takes him to some planet where the doctor is unaware of a forced 50/50 gender split.  He could say ""Hey I took rose and the others here and nothing ever happened.. oh wait... oops"".  They could even run with it and cast a female to play the same character for the rest of the season (perhaps because the process can't be reversed until a certain amount of time has passed), and then you can play it for laughs as the character is now profiting off of his female body doing live streams and such.  It'd be a lark.

But having the Doctor female.. what purpose does it serve?  There are female timelords.  Why not just bring back Romana?  Or another female time lord?  I don't see it working.

Especially because in the end a lot of the shows popularity does hinge on a certain amount of sexiness.  You're less likely to really have that with a middle age or older woman as the doctor.  Sorry to say, but even having Capaldi as the doctor was a bit of a disappointment to some female fans who have come to expect eye candy.  (And the males get their eye candy with the female companions)

Another in the growing list of those who haven't really done much in the game yet are already being invited to join Liverpool. Another potentially good player, but far from a proven striker who could go straight into the first team.

This is a fair complaint from people, but I think we've already invested too much into the future for it to make much sense for us to suddenly go for big names right now. We could spend £40m on a player like Falcao or Costa, but by the time the rest of our squad really hits their prime, they'll be getting past it.

Suarez didn't win us any trophies last year, and it's not for definite that we'd win any this year if he was still around. Same for any other established top player. Big signings right now would be a massive boost to the squad, but in terms of silverware it'd most likely be a big risk of throwing a lot of money for little gain, because they'd be out of sync with the rest of the squad development. 

Our squad is definitely not the best in the Premier League, but I think it easily has the potential to be in three to five years without us having to spend nearly as much as the likes of Man City and Chelsea on players. But for us to get on their level in the next season or so would require a lot of spending that would be overly focused on the short-term. Which is why, although it runs the risk of us not being top four this season, I think it makes sense for us to stick to buying players for two or three years' time.

-Higher dps
-Higher movement speed 
-Both equate to quicker farming and ability to kite and kill enemies.

NEGATIVES for MoM
-squishy (due to damage amplification)
-you must toggle orb to be able to life steal and slow. Manually selecting when to slow and when to life's real due to the stacking of UAMs. 

POSITIVES for HoD
-dominate large amount of creeps to help team, utility item
-purge creep for the likes of omni  repel 
-frost ogre for armour (quicker rosh due to attack speed slow)
-wolf (higher dps)
-wildkin (for armour aura)
-grants additional damage and armour 
-can stack ancients

NEGATIVES for HoD
-less attack speed than MoM
-still must toggle orb (orb walk) to be able to live steal and slow

Overall if I'm playing against a melee team with little mobility it is a must to go MoM, you can kite and kill. If they have great initiation then go dominator to tank up. A HoD can provide a lot more  for the team than a mom so I would build it 75% of the time but when they can't close the gap and or you can secure yourself better farm then go mom to exploit there lack of economy and end the game early

null,false,q_pop,null,null,null,"The 1.9% from the Vanguard fund is the historic yield - i.e. what has actually been distributed in the past year. It's net of all charges.

The advantage of a fund like that is that you are making *no call* on the markets. You've got something that literally represents the bond markets.

You're mostly buying treasuries (as they represent most of the bond issues in the world) but there are some corporates in there too. 

Investment grade corporate bonds have a credit premium - that is all you are getting over treasuries. Bond markets are very efficiently priced (thus the yield curves).

Commodities are a completely different ball-game - as they are not income-producing you are paying significant *opportunity cost* for holding them. You're also effectively trying to make a tactical call on whether oil is cheap or not - oil seems cheap because it has recently been expensive, but we suffer from a significant availability bias. I do not consider myself knowledgeable enough to make a call on commodity markets and so I prefer to stay out of it entirely. Read up on Warren Buffet's views on this.

As for five-year cash - I would personally prefer to take a hit on return and retain easier access, be that through savings accounts or gilt/bond funds. You can always resell a fixed-interest security to the market (and thus access the funds), but you can't do so with a long-term cash saving. 

In summary: You're overthinking. The return differential on any of these proposals is likely to be pretty small in the long run. No matter what you choose you are most likely to regret your decision at one point or other (commodities crash and you regret upping your exposure, they soar and you regret not doing so).

For this reason, I much prefer buying the market. Less chance of regret. You might also want to look at how Vanguard construct their Lifestrategy portfolios - that makes a pretty good basis for market-like bond allocations.

If you're not confident to make the decision you really should have a chat with a knowledgeable advisor - it's disappointing to hear that you haven't had much luck thus far.",null,0,null,1422611942,null,0,false,0,co5lew6,null,t3_2u2mct,null,t1_co5lew6,null,t1_co55tdx,null,null,null,1424309290,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

It should be available for everyone who has a dependent and a crime that is minor enough for a jail sentence to be waived.

It's not like this is the only thing that would disproportionately affect one group of people. If we make efforts to help people who have been raised in violence, then those people will benefit disproportionately compared to those whose crime stems from other places.

Depending on what area you are they can be a bigger, smaller or non-existent thing.

Where I grew up we had some waste land behind our housing estate and every few weeks we would have some travelling communities setting up camp and the council would have to begin the process of having them moved on. When that did then happen they left an almighty amount of mess behind. This varied from bins just being emptied outside the doors, chemical toilets just being upturned minutes before driving away and on one or two occasions we had furniture just abandoned there.

Here is just one from the 80s when we were literally on the brink of WW3 due to a NATO ""exercise"":

&gt; Thus, on November 7, 1983, as Soviet intelligence services were attempting to detect the early signs of a nuclear attack, NATO began to simulate one. The exercise, codenamed Able Archer, involved numerous NATO allies and simulated NATO's Command, Control, and Communications (C³) procedures during a nuclear war. Some Soviet leaders, because of the preceding world events and the exercise's particularly realistic nature, believed—in accordance with Soviet military doctrine—that the exercise may have been a cover for an actual attack

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83

NATO do this several times every year. They move a massive armed contingent around the world and simulate attack runs against whomever they are attempting to intimidate, with [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Internal_Look), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Response_2008) and [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal_Eagle) being the regular ones at present. You generally find that North Korea's silliest statements always come during such an exercise, something our press consistently seem to neglect to mention. This years Foal Eagle is scheduled for late February so keep your eyes open for the ""unprovoked threats"" they'll be reporting from the North Korean dictatorship. 

Ronald Regan later wrote in his memoirs:

&gt; ""Three years had taught me something surprising about the Russians: Many people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy were genuinely afraid of America and Americans. Perhaps this shouldn't have surprised me, but it did...During my first years in Washington, I think many of us in the administration took it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it unthinkable that the United States would launch a first strike against them. But the more experience I had with Soviet leaders and other heads of state who knew them, the more I began to realize that many Soviet officials feared us not only as adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl nuclear weapons at them in a first strike...

So, put in context a single Russian bomber flying down the English Channel isn't quite on the same level as what we do to them.

You can make the argument that the reasoning for it is as you say, but we also know, factually and statistically that more than 40% of domestic violence victims are men.  You know, the type of domestic violence suitable for jokes in films.  ""Oh don't worry about him, he's just a man.  Kick him in his balls.""

*(I will give you points if your response to this wasn't a roll of the eyes - another man whining about trivial problems.  Because, you know, assault is a trivial problem to men.  We only deal with 75% of it.)*

My argument is this.  **We have already seen sexual asymmetry in the way that social issues are dealt with when it comes to gender separation.**  So naturally when a statement like this comes out, you want it clarified.

Further, there are plenty of issues that disproportionately affect groups of people.  What is interesting, is that modern society only seems to care if they are negative to women.

EDIT:  I will also make another point.  Observe the vitriolic response of feminists to MRAs.  I personally can't stand either (MRAs are as hyperbolic as their feminist counterparts) but even the indication that men have problems which are anywhere as systemic as those women continue to have is greeted with at best disdain and at worst, threats of violence.

The concept of talent and how long it takes to become an expert in an area of study is something that has been investigated by many researchers. While there is debate on the actual amount of time required, the figure that is most commonly cited is 10,000 hours of properly guided practice. With that amount of practice, almost anyone can become an expert in their chosen field. If it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert, it takes much less to become properly informed on the subject.

 The reason Jim couldn't learn in hundreds of hours what Laura learned in less than half is that Laura was absorbing the information, doing the homework, asking questions in a much more efficient and useful way, which made the work she did much more useful and effective in helping her to understand the material. She may have learned how to do this at home or outside of school, and applied this way of thinking to all her work. It has nothing to do with genetics or inherent ability, she is just using the time she spends working in a more effective way. **And anyone can do the same if they are taught how.**

Great comment! For clarity, there are no repayment fees on the post-grad. I can pay money in at any time with no penalty.

I'm strongly considering the possibility of cashing in the stocks and shares and also kicking in £3k on top of that (approx £4.6k all-together) so that it is approx (£9k).

One thing to bear in mind is that per month I actually have £2,000 after tax on income, but a further £1,000-£1,800 PRE TAX which comes in (gets paid in the year after).

The UK would be in the same situation if the BoE wasn't willing to stand behind the pound, print money and buy up government bonds  as necessary to keep the economy and government afloat.

Because Germany refuse to let the ECB perform the same role for the eurozone, the ONLY way Greek government could balance it's budget is with huge cuts.

* What car do you have? Is it front-wheel-drive or rear? In ice and snow, FWD is typically better because the power 'drags' the car rather than pushing it. If you try and steer with all the power coming from behind you then you'll be more liable to skid. So if you have a FWD car you can relax a little (but still drive carefully). If it's RWD take extra care. 

* I'd suggest sticking to larger roads where possible and avoiding small roads that aren't well traveled (the theory being that more traffic will thaw snow and ice more quickly which will make your driving conditions better. 

* You know how much space you usually leave? Leave more. Good, now leave more. Sliding on ice is scary and can go wrong quickly - if you're too close to the car in front then you're asking for trouble. Keep your speed down in bad conditions too. That being said - don't take the piss and do 20mph on a motorway if conditions don't demand it. 

* Use your lights. Visibility is also important not just for you but so others can see you. If you're lit up, they'll register you better. 

* Set off with ample time for problems - better to arrive early than late because you hit trouble. 

* Maybe pack a few essentials in the car - it doesn't hurt to have some water, blanket / something warm, food, torch etc. just in case you should need them. 

* Make sure your car is well serviced - has oil, washing fluid, de-icer and fuel etc. on board 

* Check travel sites before you leave for traffic information so you're ready for any issues. ",null,0,null,1422615321,null,0,false,0,co5m37i,null,t3_2u6pot,null,t1_co5m37i,null,t3_2u6pot,null,null,null,1424308975,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Greece was sacrificed to save the EURO in Ireland and elsewhere (other GIIPS): That decision is what failed Greece by the Troika ie the EURO &gt; Greece.

I have to say I don't often agree with Nigel Farage's explanations even if he's pointing in the right direction (for the wrong reasons) but he does summarize the future for Greece's decision quite well here on Daily Politics (perhaps Dry January suits him better than he realizes...):-

[Why Europe fears a Grexit more than a new bailout](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/why-europe-fears-a-grexit-more-than-a-new-bailout-1.2931768)

&gt;*But there is a more self-interested reason for them to be charitable: The alternative could be even more costly.*

&gt;*Greece's critics say the country's current financial mess is its own fault because it borrowed too much. By that argument, if Greeks reject the discipline of austerity, they alone should accept the consequences of leaving the euro, the so-called Grexit.*

**Flawed argument**

&gt;*The argument is flawed in two ways. One is that in the world of finance, borrowing too much money is not just a problem for the borrower. Lenders also take a share of the responsibility, partly by setting interest rates high enough to cover losses from risky loans.*

&gt;*It is written right into the principle of bond lending that some borrowers will default. That is why interest rates differ. In theory, the high cost of borrowing discourages risky borrowers. The high income from those rates pays for a higher than expected rate of default.*

&gt;*For a number of reasons, default is difficult while Greece continues to use the euro. But if it exits the euro and switches its euro-denominated loans into a new currency, it can safely devalue that currency and start afresh.*

&gt;*The other flaw in the anti-Greece argument is the view that only Greeks will be hurt. The fact is that while the new currency, let's call it the drachma, would make European goods more expensive, the burden of austerity would be gone.*

&gt;*The country would no longer have to sell its public enterprises to the private sector, and most of the money lent to it by European banks and governments would have disappeared.*

And this leads to the the right medecine:-

&gt;*But there is a much worse outcome for the countries of Northern Europe -- if a Grexit is a success.*

&gt;*As the best-selling French economist Thomas Piketty has said, one reason inequality is a threat to capitalism is that if enough people feel they are not getting their share they will elect governments that will turn against global capital. If the Greek democratic revolution is a success, how long until a Grexit is followed by a Spanxit, an Itxit or a Franxit?*",null,0,null,1422615494,null,0,1422615732,0,co5m4fr,null,t3_2u46la,null,t1_co5m4fr,null,t1_co5l8g6,null,null,null,1424308959,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;The __Independent Press Standards Organisation__ (IPSO) was established on Monday 8 September 2014  following the windup of the [Press Complaints Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Complaints_Commission) (PCC), which had been the main industry regulator of the press in the United Kingdom since 1990. The PCC received extensive criticism for its lack of action in the [News International phone hacking scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal), including from MPs and Prime Minister [David Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron), who called for it to be replaced with a new system in July 2011.  The [Leveson Inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveson_Inquiry) was set up and reported in November 2012, recommending in favour of the establishment of a new independent body.

Motorways and major A roads will be cleared better than minor routes, so it absolutely makes sense to use those.

Make sure you have a good scraper. [This type from Halfords is by far the best that I have ever used](http://www.halfords.com/car-seats-travel-equipment/winter-essentials/ice-scrapers-demisters-squeegees/halfords-ice-buster-ice-scraper). Clear your windows and also clear any large build up of snow from your roof. Make sure you have a full tank of fuel, maybe some blankets too if you are worried about the risk of getting stranded. Also make sure that your washer fluid is filled with a reasonably strong screenwash solution, because salt from the roads will tend to build up on your windscreen and need cleaning regularly. Make sure your phone is charged.

Tips for driving in wintry weather. 

Watch your speed and keep your distance from vehicles in front. You are more likely to skid when braking or turning a corner, so try to slow down much earlier than you would normally do, and take corners a bit slower. If possible try to do your braking as you approach a bend keeping both hands on the wheel. Then just before you reach the bend, change gear if necessary and take the bend at a constant speed. Try to avoid braking and turning at the same time.

There is a huge difference between ignoring the complaints of abuse victims and ignoring the claims of people who reckon it is happening. We should absolutely listen to anyone who approaches the authorities with serious claims based on direct experience/specific knowledge of instances of abuse.

As for lockers, we don't have them now, we have desk drawers. We're moving to lockers to enable every desk to be in essence a hot desk. But even though they know there are twice as many people assigned to an area than there are desks for them (because some are only in 1-3 days a week, and those don't get a desk), they didn't put twice as many lockers as desks.

We have a microwave in our kitchenette now, but once we move we apparently won't have one. It is used heavily, by people warming lunch brought in from home mostly. We would in future have to go to the canteen to do this, which for us doesn't mean changing floors while carrying hot food, but for others will. We've been told we have to eat in the canteen - but the canteen seating area in the new building is *smaller* than in the current building - and in the current building it is always crowded at lunch time and at other times is used as an impromptu meeting space because there aren't enough meeting rooms.

So the sum total of this is: convenience being removed, personality being removed, facilities being removed, arbitrary rules they'll soon find out are impossible to follow because you can't eat your lunch in the canteen if there's nowhere to sit, higher health and safety risks due to people carrying hot food up and down the floor between canteen and ""break-out"" seating (the only non-canteen spaces we might be allowed to eat, though they haven't confirmed it).

There is a hiphop jam happening in EMpire Bar which will be a different type of night for belfast (aside from the usual shite hiphop that you find everywhere) this will be featuring homegrown grassroot talent with some big names from UK, featuring DJs, live funk bands, bboys and rappers attempting to showcase real hiphop. (I'm going to it obviously haha)

But for a friday night, yeah the cathedral quarter as RedManStrat mentioned is a good call. A lot of decent wee bars down there and you're sure to meet people and have a laugh. 

Also there is some traditional music throughout the city too, just need to know where. Check this list:

http://visit-belfast.com/whats-on/event/traditional-music-sessions
I'd recommend the GARRICK bar out of these. Not sure about Fountain, and Fibber Magees is ok, but its attached to robinsons bar which isn't considered the best place to go. 

I've personally had good time sin both but garrick wins for me. Plus with the garrick, if you're bored with that music just walk to the back bar and enjoy a night of funk, soul, and old school hiphop. Again, always a great night and great atmosphere. 

Id recommend wandering mostly. Wander through the city centre and check out back streets, which are all safe and no issues, and just go with what you feel. 

Random other bars to check out:
Whites Tavern,
Aether &amp; Echo (the area surrounding it has a lot of art, grafitti etc)

Not a green and won't vote for them but I will say that importing from France is very much an option as there is already an Interconnector connecting the two countries with at least two more planned. The existing one, IFA, was half paid for by National Grid, a private company. Is the goverment really going to say sorry, no more nuclear. Your investement was wasted? I think not.

The power is sold where the price is highest, which is often in Great Britain (NI is a seperate market).

If importing energy offsets carbon emissions, I think the same can be said for nuclear generation, especially as it would not be pratical to know how the imported energy was generated.

The main hindrance for not being able to import energy from France is that the interconnector can only transport 2GW, the two planned would be 1 GW each.",null,0,null,1422616631,null,0,false,0,co5mcjw,null,t3_2u58oh,null,t1_co5mcjw,null,t3_2u58oh,null,null,null,1424308854,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I am aware of other GP's disregarding mental health issues to pursue their own closed minded agenda.

 You need to be able to trust your doctor.

Realistically in England you're unlikely to get the sort of conditions I did there, but a few things that really make a huge difference:

1- Tyres. I once had to borrow a car with Michelin Alpin snow tyres on the front and some bullshit budget brand on the back. Didn't know a 206 could drift quite so well. It was horrifying. The whole ""don't buy budget tyres"" lesson would be a good one to pick up for your driving career anyway.

2- Momentum. I have regularly driven through areas that you simply have to maintain speed because if you stop you're never going to get going again and they'll find your frozen corpse 3 days later (okay maybe not quite that bad but you'd be there a long while).

3- A sliding tyre grips a lot less than a static one. Now that I live in Glasgow it's amazing the number of shiteating morons who just try to hoof it up hills and then are somehow surprised when they can't make it to the top (leaving two nice lines of glassy ice for me to have to avoid when getting past them as well). Use your clutch control.

4- Grip in poor conditions may vary significantly across the width of the road surface, partly due to traffic/the aforementioned shiteating morons. When it's very cold (ie, not at the moment) you'll find that there's generally less grip where other vehicles have driven.

This is probably not going to be needed for you, so the advice would be to just take it easy on this particular trip.

I understand that businesses can pay for it but it's totally ridiculous that a business park right off a major dual carriageway that's 12 miles from a capitol like Cardiff and there's nothing available at a decent price except ADSL.",null,0,null,1422617829,null,0,false,0,co5mlgh,null,t3_2u6qtg,null,t1_co5mlgh,null,t3_2u6qtg,null,null,null,1424308739,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

1. Teachers with no qualifications and no experience will earn around 4000RMB a month, which is roughly £400. I was apprehensive about this at first, but with accommodation paid, that's more than enough to live on. There are opportunities to take extra classes, or as my friend did, get private tutoring in the side to bump up your pay. Teachers with qualifications by no experience can expect to earn around 5000RMB, or £500. Teachers with both qualifications AND experience can expect to earn up to 5500RMB, or £550. If you sign up to do a years teaching, the school will pay you 6000RMB at the end of this year to cover your flights. 

2. I will be going over on a years student visa when I go next. This will allow me to work up to my 20 hours for Little London, whilst doing bits and bobs on the side. The visa is something you have to pay for however, 

3.Typical lesson goes as follows - Come in, introductions (How are you, I am fine etc) Having a student/students read the texts, and listening for any words they seem to struggle with (Unusually is normally one) and help correct them. Then, as long as the teachers comments on the lesson plan have been observed, I usually play games with them for the rest of the lesson to help further their grasp of english language and pronunciation. Lessons are only 40 minutes long aswell. 

4. Taxis in Hohhot are unbelievable cheap. The starting fee is 8RMB or 80p, which then goes up by 1.5RMB (0.15p) ever kilometer. From the airport to Hohhot centre costs about 35RMB (£3.50) and to the Honder University campus is about 25RMB (£2.50)

5. I went out for 2 months purely to see if this is something I feel I could commit to for 6 months/a year. I kinda wish I had gone for a year straight of the bat now, but don't regret taking the time to find out wether i liked it (Although the plane tickets are a pain in the ass)

6. I went through a company called GoChinaGo, which is owned and managed by a friend of mine. We're in the process of sorting the website and official informations packs at the moment, so as soon as they are done, I shall post a link!

Point 1 depends on the uni. There is variation. In scotland I needed a certain number of SCOTCAT points, which  I guess is different in england. On my course if you didnt do so well you got a regular BSc not a BSc (hons), and could leave after 3 years rather than 4.

Generally June/July for graduation, but youve often finished your studies well before then, there is a winter one in November or something, for those who cant make that (teaching etc)

3) Thats your grade. Again varies wildly by department. In my computing dept if you failed any final year modules you were capped at a 2:1 and couldnt get a first (which would require mostly As), a 2:1 meant you got nearly Bs and some As, a 2:2 mostly Bs, and a 3rd was Cs and Ds. If you get a 3rd that doesnt look good on a CV. You want to get a 2:1 or a first.

4) Depends on uni . Sometimes, sometimes optional. Look up ""sandwich year"". Can be paid or unpaid. I worked as a software developer for 3 months in between my 3rd and 4th year, got paid.

&gt; Its no longer about Men vs Women, its about the 0.01% of the population controlling all the wealth and assets, its a screwed up version of vampire capitalism which is continually exploiting mass voulmes of workers acroos the globe. It needs to change

Let's see if the BBC make it an Editor's Pick, which is what gets top viewing (just BBC's system of hiding the most popular comments)

More top comments reference ""a race to the bottom"", """"wealthy once again screw the little people"", ""more divide and rule"", ""capitalist class is engaged in the effective robbery of their workforce"", ""corporations have used the Financial Crash as an excuse to reduce wages and increase profits"", ""richest 65 people in the world control 90% of the world's wealth"", ""we mere minions get nothing"".

Which is the only comment the BBC lets you see on the default page?

&gt; Not surprised. Women have been playing catch up on pay since the ""equal pay"" act came in several years ago. Larger businesses (and maybe smaller too) - or at least the more reputable ones - will have been gradually redressing the balance. Some might argue this should have happened instantly as soon as the equal pay act became law, I can see why this might have been impractical.

Basically, a lame sock of a comment. Selected because it doesn't reflect the popular consensus.

Clearly the BBC is trying to manage perceptions. I suggest they remove comment voting, so that even if you do want to see the real comments, as opposed to the BBC's approved favourite comment, they will only appear in chronological order.",null,0,null,1422619248,null,0,1422620062,0,co5mwru,null,t3_2u6qph,null,t1_co5mwru,null,t3_2u6qph,null,null,null,1424308592,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

Nobody needs these speeds, because so very few things on the internet can take advantage of it. Torrenting without a VPN might max it out but (1) if everybody did that the congestion would be awful latency and speed for everyone would be abysmal and (2) it's illegal.

The most dire predictions for how much the animal suffers when killed without stunning is about two seconds of 'extreme pain'. For this, people are prepared to devote front page headlines to the 'barbarism' of halal slaughter, campaign for halal meat to be removed from food supply chains and introduce extremely tough legislation to prevent it from happening.

But if people *really* cared about animals, the method of slaughter is a complete non-issue. They would campaign on - for example - making sure animals are definately dead before being flayed, making sure animals don't see other animals being slaughtered and making sure slaughterhouses are frequently inspected without warning to ensure workers treat the condemned animals with dignity and respect. Heck, we could go *super* hippy and campaign to improve the welfare standards of battery animals, for example making practices like 'de-beaking' illegal, forcing farmers to respect - in law - the social well-being of community animals like pigs and cows. I mean, if all these people who suddenly discovered that animal welfare is so deeply important actually *didn't eat animals* for a couple of weeks they'd do far more for the welfare of animals by preventing the birth of yet more animals to repeat this cruel cycle than they ever will by preventing halal slaughter.

It seems - to me - to be using the suffering of animals as a stick to beat Muslims over the head with.

Allegations that the recent furore over halal meat is at least in part driven by Islam's current bogeyman status in the UK can't be dismissed out of hand.

Tesco have a well documented history of lowering the price of certain good to the point that they are making a huge loss on them in a particular store, until all the competition has been shut down, and then raising the price back up the very same week. Tesco obviously see local business as competition, so why don't you?  
  
Yeah you just described what is commonly called ""free enterprise"". Why would a store not have the right to set prices as they wanted, including strategic pricing? It is not only what the shareholders expect, it's what the LAW expects (any CEO not running his company according to maximization of profit opens himself up to lawsuits from the shareholders/ dismissal by the board of directors, according to the principles of sound merchant conduct or whatever that law is called in the UK).  
Again, I am just flabbergasted that anyone would see ""protecting"" shitty little stores from competition (i.e. depriving customers of choice and lowest available price, which may not matter to you, but sure as shit matters to people on the breadline) as a sound policy. It's not liberalism, it is actually CONSERVATIVE (in resisting the change induced by free enterprise) in the worst way.  
And if we're talking about great political leaders of the 70s/ 80s, you will probably not be surprised to hear that I am a great fan of the underappreciated Maggie Thatcher, who probably was the best prime minister your country had since Churchill. So there.

Our outer London offices max out at 15MB/1MB. I often use my phone as a 4G hotspot because its faster.

At home (10 minutes walk from the outer London office) I have 160MB/10MB up due to cable. As someone who works a lot with video (4-20GB of files being common) I frequently go home just to download/upload files because it can take, literally, **days** to upload from the office.

In short, its not just rural area's that have crappy broadband - BT severely hamper UK business competitiveness. My company has lost tens of thousands in business due to our being able to offer decent broadband speeds and its a location sensitive business so we can't just move. I'm actually anticipating that this will be solved by 5G services before BTs fibre plans get rolled out.

&gt;  I don't think that violence towards men is funny (well, sometimes slapstick-y stuff in comedy is, but only to the extent that it is for women).

So essentially you position yourself as an arbiter of humour.  The remainder of the comments were just people either acting confused or making a few other mild jokes at your expense.  As a British person, you know well the natural reaction to the humourless.  You came across as humourless.

You do have my sympathy.  Reddit, like a number of communal internet spaces, has imported chan culture which in itself is just gaming culture once removed.  This culture is inherently adolescent and interactions with women are limited to TITS OR GTFO.

However, this is not a male unique phenomenon either.

We have already seen in Myspace and Tumblr how vitriolic a female dominated internet space can be and how abusive and irrational they become when they feel their interests are threatened.  I have personally seen the abuse even low end MRA blogs get from feminists.

The situation is, as you say, not gender unique.  I never claimed that women didn't experience this.  Only that it is very difficult for men to admit that they have societal problems without getting absolutely dogpiled by either misguided male feminists who seem to think it is their duty to protect their damsels or by utterly repulsive vitriologues whose only redeeming feature is that they occasionally menstruate.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; Rolling this out now is fairly pointless there isn't the broader infrastructure to take advantage of it. The rate limiting factor at the moment is not my connection to the ISP, or my ISP's connection. I get slow downloads on PSN, but great downloads on Steam. Having a faster broadband speed from my ISP will not help this, as the problem is not within their network.

A rollout of a new technology is going to take years. Even BT are saying that G.fast will take about a decade. You're applying your own limited examples to long term decision making. I hope BT wouldn't make technology decisions based on how much bandwidth Sony has to the internet...

I have little problem achieving line saturation on many servers with my nearly 80Mbit FTTC.

FTTP does not mean BT would have to only give people 1Gbit connections. They don't even do that now - if you want 40 or 80Mbit, you can have that. The point is that it doesn't matter where you live, if you can get FTTP you can get that speed, guaranteed, and it won't be reduced by line length, crosstalk, RF interference and other factors. If/when faster speeds become more necessary, it is much easier and quicker for BT to do it.

&gt; It can be an issue with ISPs. Congestion and latency depends on the network you use and how your ISPs manage it. I've heard lots of accounts of, for example, Virgin FTTP suffering congestion during peak times. Speeds between the cabinet and the home are obviously not an issue!

Virgin is not fibre to the premises. It is a hybrid fibre-coax network where the entire local area (a few streets) is sharing a couple of hundred megabits of capacity and customers get copper co-ax to the home. Because of this, congestion is very easy to create - when you're offering 150Mbit to your customers, almost one user maxing out in the area can use up most of the available capacity. It has nothing to do with BT's network, so it is not relevant here.

With the BT network, the FTTC cabinets have gigabits of backhaul, so local congestion is never likely to be an issue. BT's FTTP network works similarly to Virgin's, except that it is all fibre, but there is enough available capacity for congestion to not be a serious issue. Good ISPs also manage their end to make sure they are not a bottleneck, too. Maybe people on TalkTalk paying £2 a month for ""unlimited broadband"" will see problems.

&gt; Explain how FTTP solves geography any better than FTTC. There are more areas where FTTC is available where FTTP isn't. That's kind of the point of FTTC - less digging up of roads and easier to roll out.

Because FTTC, like all copper based broadband services, is limited in what it can provide by line length and other factors. People in more rural areas whose line may be connected via an FTTC cabinet do not always achieve very good speeds because they're several kilometres away from the cabinet.

FTTC is a cheap bodge. It allows BT to claim better coverage more quickly, but it doesn't necessarily mean great speeds for everyone in the coverage area. It also has no real room for expansion - those who can barely get 80Mbit today are not likely to get much higher speeds unless BT starts doing line bonding, or FTTP.

FTTP eliminates these issues because it has no practical distance requirement (there is, but it's tens of kilometres) - if you have FTTP, you can get BT's current maximum of 330Mbit even if you live far away from the exchange. It costs more, and is slower to deploy, but it is overall the better solution (and allows for cost savings through not having to maintain so much old, aging, rotting copper, or dealing with broadband issues because of that)",null,0,null,1422621082,null,0,1422621571,0,co5nd93,null,t3_2u6qtg,null,t1_co5nd93,null,t1_co5n99f,null,null,null,1424308379,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

null,false,slippyg,null,Housing Officer,null,"To the best of my knowledge there's no requirement for a letting agent to disclose information about building work going on nearby. It's unlikely an agent would check local planning applications for each property they manage; you would usually expect the prospective tenant to do this as the agent has no power over the adjoining areas. 

If you feel like the property was marketed towards you as quiet, you'd have to take a complaint up with the branch manager of the agent. All agents are required to belong to a property redress scheme, either [The Property Ombudsman](http://www.tpos.co.uk/), [The Ombudsman Service for Property](http://www.ombudsman-services.org/property.html) or [The Property Redress Scheme](https://www.theprs.co.uk/). You can make a complaint about the agent but wouldn't expect it to go far given the above.

Regarding your ceiling leaking water, you can contact your local council. They will usually have a team that deals with private landlords either in environmental health or housing. They will be able to assess the situation, if it's a hazard they may be able to service an improvement notice requiring your landlord to fix the issue by a certain date.

The landlord is required to make sure that appliances provided at the start of the tenancy are safe and in good working order, there is no statutory obligation for the landlord to repair white goods. Environmental health might take a dim view of the oven being broken in terms of the health and safety of the property, if it's your only means of cooking. It will depend on the situation as this legislation is separate from the landlords repair obligations.

I would ask the landlord to confirm in writing if he is happy for you to carry out the repairs yourself and deduct it from the rent. People are lazy and if you give him a simple solution he might agree. Don't withhold rent without his agreement.

e.g. the places where there are no blocks of flats to worry about, everyone on the pole is reasonably close to it, and it's overhead wiring so apart from getting fibre to the pole (which would be a problem with Gfast anyway) running the extra 10 metres straight to the home would not be a huge, impossible task. Like my own pole with about 6 or 7 houses on it, where BT managed to move it up the street and replace everyone's drop cables within a day due to a new housing estate needing poles to be moved. Shame that they didn't think about FTTP while pulling in the new copper for that estate

And having seen some of the very rural locations where BT has seen fit to deploy FTTP (I'm talking rural farmhouses, where they have their own pole/DP, and they live quite a distance from that, yet there's the FTTP splitter nicely mounted on top), even they don't see it as an impossiblity.

Look, I'm not denying that feminism (in most cases at least) supports equality for men - otherwise it would look rather hypocritical.

These are just a few social and political examples that come to mind.

Feminism is pro-equality for women - otherwise the name FEMinism is redundant. It's not directly for equality for men and as such by 'fighting the patriarchy' as feminism claims to do we are not solving women's and men's problems - only women's.

As I have commented elsewhere: 

&gt;The issue with very short hair is that it is associated with the skinhead culture.

&gt;It is banned in many school for several reasons, first, schools do not want skinhead culture developing within their school. They also do not want the public thinking there are skinheads in their school. This comes back to the issue of the school having the right to project an image through its students, just as employers do.

&gt;Also, it can be a matter of protecting the children. If they are seen in public and mistaken for a skinhead they could targeted, either by people who disagree with that culture, or skinheads themselves, looking to recruit new members.

&gt;It can cause problems such as an anti skinhead groups hanging around outside the school and attacking anyone they suspect as being a member.

This is the view of a minority at the top of the party. Not the view of the party at whole. And they are right about one thing - we have an ageing population and (relative) decreasing work force. The NHS is going to get considerably more expensive per working head in the years to come - at the very least it makes sense to think and plan about this now.

&gt;  which might be lovely if you are a ""young upper-middle class graduate"" but not so great if you are poor as fuck with fuck all education and from a difficult background.

So. Your claim was wrong - they are fuck some people up the ass.

&gt; Those people exist in vast numbers and it's basically cunty as fuck to condemn them to brutal poverty because 'fuck you, got mine'...

There is no definitive evidence either way on right wing policies condemning all already in poverty to stay in it. If they actually work entirely it brings everybody up - as we approach high employment standards have to increase for companies to find the staff.

And my father &amp; pretty much everyone he is friends with started out at the very bottom &amp; worked their way up. So I don't buy the claims that you can't. There was little luck involved for any of them - just an insane work ethic &amp; being decent people.

&gt; I just hate their populist politics

They are still a young party. They have a few well investigated headline policies &amp; the rest are still in development. I'd argue wait until the manifesto comes out. And yes their will be popular things in there - because the party hasn't experience against public interest. So many of its members views will align with public view for the short term.

&gt; blaming the economy on foreigners to garner votes.

They don't. They blame capacity shortages in infrastructure &amp; services on them, but little of the economy (directly). Feel free to prove me wrong with an example (from the party, not some nobody councillor).

&gt; I've some serious reservations about the EU too, but I am certainly not going to throw my lot into a party that is reactionary, blustering and frankly fucking dangerous.

They are by no means dangerous yet in that they will not get the majority of seats at the coming election.

null,false,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,null,"M and A roads are generally fine as long as you don't drive *just* after a heavy snowfall.

The roads to be careful of are the secondary roads, and roads within housing estates. These can become completely covered in ice. So be careful when turning off and on these roads.  If you're driving on an icy road, and you approach a junction, test your brakes early to see if you are going to skid. I actually give the brakes a quick hard push to see how much grip I can achieve. Most likely your ABS will kick in and you'll hear/feel a grinding noise. This means you've got less traction and you will have to start braking much earlier. Better to skid for 20m before the junction than to skid across the road in to the traffic. 

At Christmas, I had to travel North to see some relatives. I checked local police reports, and also checked on Twitter to see if anyone had reported bad conditions on certain roads. Someone said the A47 was icy, so I took the A6 to Leicester instead. I even asked some people, via Twitter, what their local roads were like.

I use the Motorway cameras http://www.motorwaycameras.co.uk/ to look at the local conditions. You can generally see to the sides of the motorway and it's pretty obvious if there is snow on the ground or not.

I can absolutely understand this sentiment. But I also understand the schools position. The reason that a great many schools ban this haircut is that it has associations with gang culture. As the school sees it:

They don't want gangs developing in their school

They don't want local people looking at who is coming out of their school and thinking it is full of gang members.

They don't want their pupils being targeted by rival gangs

They don't want gangs trying to recruit their students.

There are all very reasonable reasons to ban one particular haircut in my opinion.

But again, in any case I'm not talking about local congestion between consumer and ISP, or necessarily congestion within the ISP networks, but real world internet usage very rarely needs or can take advantage what currently is considered good. My examples weren't about throttling of congestion happening within my ISP, but elsewhere on the internet. If that's congestion at the content provider end (which imagine is the issue with my PSN example) or some intermittent carrier network, it doesn't really matter for the consumer. 

We both agree(?) getting more people up to that standard is the big issue, and my point is getting more people to 40Mbps (or whatever more modest target) is more impactful. Sure FTTC is a bodge job. Everything ever done with domestic ISP that involves the old copper wire is a bodge job. I'm not disagreeing with you. FTTP is indeed a better tech, obviously. Nobody is saying otherwise. But given the option of increasing FTTC as a stop gap is more economical than saying FTTP or nothing, and would get more people up to useful speeds now. There is no reason this can't be managed along side a more gradual widespread FTTP roll out. Realistically, the economics of getting FTTP to every single residence in the UK means that bodge jobs are necessary.

I'm saying that getting higher speed ISP connections is a secondary concern to wider geographical coverage.",null,0,null,1422624392,null,0,false,0,co5ocyp,null,t3_2u6qtg,null,t1_co5ocyp,null,t1_co5nd93,null,null,null,1424307917,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; but real world internet usage very rarely needs or can take advantage what currently is considered good. My examples weren't about throttling of congestion happening within my ISP, but elsewhere on the internet. If that's congestion at the content provider end (which imagine is the issue with my PSN example) or some intermittent carrier network, it doesn't really matter for the consumer. 

I'd still say that this is missing the point somewhat. That a couple of sites cannot give you full speed does not mean that faster and better connectivity is not important. 

Your argument could just as much apply to the days when ADSL was new and everyone was on dialup, or the days where faster cable connections were outstripping most people's ADSL. Doesn't mean it wasn't a good thing in the end.

Content companies will upgrade their connectivity as appropriate. And personally, I don't see what you claim - it is easy and normal for me to max out my nearly-80Mbit connection with the stuff I download.

&gt;  But given the option of increasing FTTC as a stop gap is more economical than saying FTTP or nothing, and would get more people up to useful speeds now.

The problem with all these stop gaps is that you end up paying more and taking longer than if you just did it properly in the first place - and as I said, a lot of people aren't seeing benefits and likely won't unless or until BT comes back and puts even more money into it.

&gt; There is no reason this can't be managed along side a more gradual widespread FTTP roll out. Realistically, the economics of getting FTTP to every single residence in the UK means that bodge jobs are necessary.

I can't agree here. It might be necessary for BT's short term profits and their shareholders' dividends, but not in reality. If we thought the same way about roads, railways, rural electrification, water/gas, nothing would happen.

I've seen some very very rural areas where BT has FTTP, installed likely at enormous cost. They will do it when they want to, or when they have to (e.g. in those northern villages where B4RN gigabit FTTP exists, BT is now scrambling to do the same areas with their own FTTP network).

The government is prepared to put tens of billions into HS2 for a few cities in the north to get to London a bit quicker. I'd bet that even a fraction of this could build a serious FTTH network for everyone.

&gt; I'm saying that getting higher speed ISP connections is a secondary concern to wider geographical coverage.

And I am saying that FTTP (and Gfast) do both - the only real way to sort the issue out once and for all is to push fibre to the home, or close enough to it - and that isn't just to give people 500Mbit tomorrow, but to give them 40 or 80Mbit today. Or, as we already see today, there will be the haves and the have nots - just as it was dialup vs ADSL, it's now slow/no FTTC vs good FTTC vs FTTP. 

You seem to be fixated on the idea that FTTP = 1Gbit to the home, probably because of companies like Google (who can offer such speeds safely knowing that it won't be an issue because no one can max it out). It isn't and doesn't have to be that way. Most FTTP providers aren't rolling it out to do that, but to eliminate the issues of maintaining an aging copper network, and increase speeds to something more usable today - but will also be safely able to deal with the future, too",null,0,null,1422624932,null,0,1422625315,0,co5ojtp,null,t3_2u6qtg,null,t1_co5ojtp,null,t1_co5ocyp,null,null,null,1424307827,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

1. Normally you will have to write a thesis, pass exams and meet other course requirements. You will get ECTS credits but I don't think they're very well known here - I hadn't even heard of them until I saw them on my final transcript. Bachelor's degrees last 3-4 years (varies by subject and university), Master's degrees 1-2 years. Be aware that for some science subjects some universities offer ""undergraduate master's degrees"". This is a 4-year undergraduate degree but you graduate with, for example, an MChem (Master of Chemistry) rather than a BSc Chemistry. Note that an MChem is not quite the same as an MSc Chemistry. In the UK an MChem (or other undergrad master's degree) is enough for you to enter a PhD programme, but I'm not sure how well-known or acceptable they are in other countries.

2. Depends on your university. Usually within a few weeks of you finishing your degree requirements. Some universities are more flexible and will allow you to graduate months or even years afterwards if you want to. You normally receive your diploma (fancy piece of paper) on the day of the degree ceremony.

3. That's you final, overall, grade. [More info here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification)

4. Depends on your course.

Wings. Chadli is the only one playing well consistently. Lamela is hardly playing to his potential (not even close), Townsend is similar in that a game or two can be good/very good but plays meh/okay in general (and needs to stop trying to do too much on the ball you can't take on entire teams, sort out his passing and first touch). Lennon can show signs for maybe 5 games a year. Unfortunately the targets will almost certainly have better offers (Depay and Man U) 

Strikers need no explanation.

Centre backs - 3 I'm very happy with, Vlad plays like a converted winger and Kaboul is not exactly inspiring confidence.

Left/right backs - Generally fine. Dier can play right in a pinch with my logic for keeping Vlad is mainly as a backup here, he can be himself more (i.e. attack). Walker, Dier, Rose are fine imo. Yedlin? Wait until next season. Hopefully he can improve a lot.

Keepers - good. Hopefully this doesn't change in the summer.

Centre mids - generally good but frustrating. Dembele *could* be so amazing but rarely plays to even half his potential (get forward more, take a few more shots damn it), Capoue could be fantastic, Mason and Bentaleb will hopefully be so too, Paul is the most frustrating here but can be played behind the striker. He drops too deep taking the ball off the centre backs (no need, why even do that? Let them play it out) *or* he needs to be given permission to be the one further forward more often.

Eriksen - can't clone him soon enough. Needs to be stronger in tackles, turn out more (especially to his right).",null,0,null,1422625527,null,0,false,0,co5orj6,null,t3_2u6zw0,null,t1_co5orj6,null,t3_2u6zw0,null,null,null,1424307727,null,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6,null

Vote for Policies is not a source. It's a means of misrepresenting politics which happens to point people in favour of a party which you support, because it ignores their weaknesses.

&gt;I think a blind look at manifestos is a good thing. You think any look at manifestos (blind or not!) is pointless, I disagree.

Less pointless to look at a manifesto unblindly - blindly, why should there be any point? I might like Labour's policy of freezing energy bills - I still know they won't do it.

&gt;You also think that the only way we should interact with politicians is through the mainstream media. This is very harmful.

Perhaps, but as I say it's not the whole story.

&gt; It still isn't FTTP. It's fibre closer to the premises. It's still relying on good ol' copper for the last bit, it just relies on a shorter bit of copper. Really, you could just build more cabinets and give more people FTTC. Which effectively is what this is.

As much as I've said I disagree with BT using g.fast, it isn't really the same as FTTC at all.

The problem with FTTC that we both agree on is that your line length dictates speed. There will be people who are 10 metres from the cabinet getting 80Mbit, and people who are 5+ kilometres away getting no benefit at all.

With G.fast, BT will likely have to run fibre all the way to the pole outside your house. This means that everyone on the pole will get decent speeds because there is not the same spread of distances. Some might be 5 metres, some might be 10 or 20 metres, some might be a bit more. But everyone will get good speeds although some will be better than others.

BT could theoretically do the same with more FTTC cabinets, but it doesn't really fit in with the way their network is built. FTTC works because the FTTC cabinets are installed alongside existing copper cross connect cabinets (but which doesn't necessarily fit in with the way the houses are placed). G.fast theoretically works because they will put the equipment on the poles and wire it straight into the cable going to your house. They fit in logically. In addition to all of this, G.fast will provide much faster speeds. But that's a nice bonus.

FTTP would eliminate all of this and give everyone the best possible connection.",null,0,null,1422626443,null,0,false,0,co5p41x,null,t3_2u6qtg,null,t1_co5p41x,null,t1_co5oziw,null,null,null,1424307564,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That would be logical. They don't seem to do this as a guaranteed thing, though. Certainly the new housing estate across the road from me is is FTTC on my cabinet, despite the fact that BT had to pull in new copper to serve the houses, and had to re-arrange the poles in the street for new road junctions (this is in a village that does have some FTTP)

Knowing BT they probably try to get the developer to pay.

They do offer voice over fibre. I believe the battery backup is pitiful though, like an hour, because they use 4 rechargable AA batteries rather than a proper UPS-type lead-acid battery

&gt; The thing is, each install/upgrade will have to be done seperatly. FTTC/FTT(Pole) is easy, because they just build the infrastructure, and swap it over. 

I don't understand. FTTC/FTTdp still require work to be done on each line as each customer orders the service, at the cabinet/pole.

null,false,craichoor,null,null,null,"Coming from the 26 Counties I am highly opposed to our system of segregated education. I believe it's hugely detrimental and far too much time is wasted on religious instruction, the most time spent on religious instruction in the OECD after Israel. I believe in the secularisation of education in the 26 counties.

I too believe in the secularisation of education in the 6 counties, however I don't believe it's the panacea for the conflict in the north. Are the 10% of students that attend non-denominational schools devoid of an opinion on the constitutional status of the north? Which is the crux of the conflict, not religion or religious expression.  

Education for Mutual Understanding has been part of the NI curriculum since 1992. It is a compulsory part of the curriculum. 

&gt; The objectives of EMU show that it is about, inter alia, ""fostering self-respect, respect for others and the improvement of relationships between people of differing cultural traditions"", and is set within the progressively widening context of Northern Ireland, the island of Ireland, the British Isles and the wider world. 

That and Schools Community Relations Programme are important to help foster good community relations. And yet the author made no reference to these efforts. 

Religious Education is compulsory in all schools in the north, controlled and voluntary. The author states that a Catholic Grammar school encourages its students to study religion, it compells its students to study religion like **all schools in the north**. 

&gt; The Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 gave the Department of Education, for the first time, the power to specify a core syllabus for religious education for use in all grant-aided schools in Northern Ireland. This core syllabus is not intended to be the total provision for religious education in schools, but will provide the basis on which each school can build a programme to suit its particular needs. It was drawn up after wide consultation by a group made up of the four main churches in Northern Ireland and **is entirely Christian in content**. The core syllabus became compulsory for all pupils in September 1996. 



All in all it was a pretty shit article that came across as a whine without providing possible solutions to the perceived problems the author sees with the education system in the north. 


Although solutions for education in the north are incredibly hard to come by. 


The teaching of history is an oft quoted problem, can a balance be achieved? The A-Level History Curriculum states that 

Students must:

* study the history of more than one country
* study a British history option for Component 1 or 2
* study a non-British history option for Component 1 or 2
* study topics from a chronological range of at least 200 years

I believe it's hardly fair to force Nationalist/Irish citizens to study British history.
(I may be very wrong in this as I am unable to find a KS5 A-Level History Curriculum for Northern Ireland)


Can a shared history truly be thought when a British narrative is about Imperialism and Empire Building whilst the Irish narrative in anti-colonial? 


Academics looking at primary and secondary students interaction with history found that

* Students appreciated school history’s commitment to balance as an alternative to the partisan histories they encountered outside school.
* Most were less interested in the purely “academic” side of history than its usefulness in helping them understand the origins of contemporary conflict.
* Students were not simply accepting or rejecting either school or community history but were drawing from each to pursue their own interests.
* Students remained loyal to their original political commitments, but they wanted to reach their own conclusions rather being compelled to follow what others believed

(McCully and Barton)


If secularisation is brought in, what would be the position of Gaelscoileanna? Many are already secular but as the author points out they are nearly exclusively Irish/Nationalist/Catholic. Therefore they couldn't be used as as engine of integration.


If secularisation was brought in would schools, parents and political parties find to another way to perpetuate sectarian / ethno-national division? Former Catholics schools to petition to move to curriculum and control of the Department of Education in the 26 Counties? Adoption of Irish as language of instruction? Adoption of Irish Primary Curriculum and Junior and Leaving Certificates. 


Another elephant in the room for segregation is that the 6 counties isn't fully mixed geographically, students in demographically uniform areas are not automatically going to get cross-community contact. Another problem is sport, sport in the North is segregated and this too applies to school sport. Will the schools that predominantly play Gaelic Games start playing other sports? 


Overall, secularisation is needed in the North, like everywhere, in my opinion, but it'll be a long time before it is brought in as it is a political nettle and the current parties benefit from the propagation of two distinct communities and regardless of creation of a ""Northern Irish"" identity the constitutional question will always be at the apex of politics in the Six Counties.

You seem to have highjacked my point slightly making a point that I actually completely agree with.

I will bet a shiny 50p that coverage with this new tech will be patchy, so not all residences are going to benefit from it. I will bet a further 25p that they wont use this to address the issues in areas where they're struggling to get anything near ""broadband"" speeds and not bother addressing areas with awful coverage. I would be amazed if this new tech was rolled out universally. It will be sold in certain areas, and the selling point will be the speed because that's all ISPs think matters to consumers.

Religion is a fun topic to discuss, but no credible study can be done of it as it has no factual basis - it's as useful as discussing the philosophy of Sauron in the LOTR. Useful as a thought experiment, useless in every other practical way.

I would also note, one of the main reasons philosophy of religion exists is to examine the effects of religion on society, not to defend religion.

You claimed that Plantinga's work ""conclusively"" put the topic to bed. I'm amazed you could even type that with a straight face, his free will defence has been taken apart by countless other philosophers.

But it is a well know fact that a short haircut like that is associated with some gang culture.

The Kosher/Halal method of slaughter is considered by [*holy book of choice*] to be the most painless method of killing. Two thousand-ish years ago, this was probably true. The butchers use an incredibly sharp knife, the animal is dead within seconds, some believe brain dead instantly. Wikipedia says:

&gt; According to Jewish religious sources, this results in a rapid drop in blood pressure in the brain and loss of consciousness rendering the animal insensible to pain

Again, 2000 years ago, compared to decapitation or just smashing a cow's face in with a mallet, I'm sure that the Kosher/Halal method was fairly quick and painless.

Now with science and stuff we know that shocking them is the best way. However, Kosher slaughter (shechita) must be conducted with ""respect and compassion"" for the animal. The whole idea of an electric shock is considered to be both undignified and an unnecessary pain, so is contrary to both of the main facets of shechita.

So overall remember that a) Jews think shechita is completely pain-free and b) their opinions probably won't be swayed too much by modern science.

He's been out of form this year and has been displaced as the starter this year, but is still 25, and he's been very good in all years except this. They also have Ginter as their young highly rated 3rd choice centre back (kind of like us with Zouma), meaning that Subotic will be left out. He's also Serbian, so I think coming a team with Ivanovic and Matic already here could intrigue him. He's also really good in the air, and would add to the massive team we have, since he's 6-4.

But I can't help but think that the description of the guy's eye condition by his mum is little different to the sort of the thing that is always said, ""There's no way he would be involved, he wouldn't harm a fly, he couldn't lift a feather"" etc. Except in this case they're referencing an eye-condition he had. It's not beyond the realms of possibility that certain medical conditions would be exaggerated, even by specialist witnesses, in order to secure an acquittal.

However, if his eye sight really is that bad, and the crucial event was over very quickly, then he wouldn't have had much opportunity to act in such away as to distance himself from the assault. That might be by intervening, objecting to it, running away immediately even. Whether or not that would be enough to prove he was not culpable, I don't know, because I don't know the preceise details of the law. But I get the impression that if all the other members of the gang had said, ""Jordan [specifically] said to stop."" or if they all said he had no idea what was going on then he would have been acquitted.

You're also getting into a discussion of whether we treat disabled people like children who can't be responsible for their actions because they can't quite see as much or hear as much or hit as hard. If we look at that example of his vision on the BBC site, it looks pretty bad. But imagine if that was the only way you could see so you were used to it, then imagine that filter being applied to footage of a group beating a man to death. Do you think you would notice what was going on?

I would presume this was all discussed in court though, and the jury decided that he was guilty even taking his poor eyesight into consideration. I think there's an argument that even with bad eyesight, you can still understand that you're hanging around with a bunch of bellends that get up to no good and that you have to bear some of the responsibility when the group does something bad, even if you weren't directly involved, because you should have had the expectation that it could happen.

I'm very much in favour of the joint enterprise law. I think it's perfectly defendable to convict a group of people for a crime commited by someone within that group, where you have a reasonable suspicion that they know exactly who did what and when, but none of them are talking. I'm quite comfortable with this guy going to jail for what was done by the group he was with.

Also, interested to check out the Citizen's Income Trust, I checked out [their website](http://www.citizensincome.org/) and there's a rather interesting statement on the top of the page. I will quote it in full as it is very relevant not just to this strand of the discussion but to this whole topic:

&gt;
The article that Patrick Wintour wrote in the Guardian on the 27th January was partly based on an Institute for Social and Economic Research research paper, 'A Feasible Way to Implement a Citizen's Income',that we put on our website last October and that we have recently republished in the Citizen's Income Newsletter. This shows that the Citizen's Income scheme outlined in our 2013 introductory booklet would generate losses for some households with low disposable incomes ( - most of these losses would be small). Given the markedly reduced marginal deduction rates that these households would then experience, recouping small losses through additional earnings would be much easier than it would be under the current means-tested benefits system.
&gt;
The paper goes on to show that a Citizen's Income scheme based on the same level of Citizen's Income, but which leaves means-tested benefits in place and reduces them by taking into account the household's Citizen's Incomes in the same way that other income is taken into account when means-tested benefits are calculated, would eliminate losses for low-income households; and that a slightly smaller Citizen's Income could eliminate losses for almost all households. (The fact that Income Tax rates would rise is not a problem. The important point is that households would not suffer net losses in disposable income.)
&gt;
**The Green Party has not yet published details of its Citizen's Income scheme. Our research shows that if a Citizen's Income of £72 per week for working age adults (more for older people, less for younger people and children) were to be implemented then it would be perfectly possible to do so without imposing losses on low-income households.** 

Emphasis mine. So, essentially, it seems to me, the Citizen's Income Trust actually seems to suggest that a scheme more in line with what it seems the Greens are likely to impose is perfectly workable in their view, essentially the opposite of what the Grauniad is suggesting their opinion is.",null,0,null,1422632494,null,0,1422633039,0,co5s20r,null,t3_2u6m61,null,t1_co5s20r,null,t1_co5rrtw,null,null,null,1424306189,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

I think Kaboul and Adebayor should be sold as they are nowhere near the first team.

I think Soldado should be retained as he is seemingly well liked and relatively settled at the club. He doesn't mind playing a squad role and is a good senior pro to mentor the younger players (and hopefully his scoring should improve - fingers crossed).

Lennon should stay and get his testimonial - he deserves it and then (a bit like Man Utd with Fletcher) we should help him find somewhere to enjoy the last few years of his football without him aiding a direct rival.

Capoue, Paulinho and Chirches should all stay for different reasons. Capoue should stay because but for the rumoured bust up he had done well in the team (people forget that) the same applies (to a lesser extent) to Paulinho. The key should be to rehabilitate even if the plan is to move on at a later date. Chiriches should stay because he provides senior cover (yes, I know he's accident prone, but I think he can ""do a job in supporting the younger players - its important to bear in mind that Fazio and Vertonghen are the only two players capable of offering any leadership to the defensive unit).

The reason Liverpool are a big club is because for whatever reason their story continues to connect with many, many fans from around the globe.

Other arguments I've heard are that stunning the animals is not done out of ethical motivations, but to allow for faster processing/slaughter, which allows a lot of other rules to be broken (eg for halal meat, one animal should not see any others being killed, and the animal being killed should not see the blade, so as to not cause distress); or that stunning just paralyses the animal but doesn't anaesthetise it so it's kind of like torture. 

There's kind of a divide in the Muslim community because some authorities say that stunning is allowed, and others say that it isn't, so it's not as strictly adhered to as in kosher slaughter.

My argument is that *even if* the worst possible world was true - say sixty seconds of blood aspiration compared to Western slaughter techniques which are completely painless and don't distress the animal (which is not true - we have to compare apples with apples) - we could still seriously question whether campaigning against halal slaughter is the most useful thing you could be doing to end animal suffering.

Eriksen knows that Spurs is the right fit for him because he makes the team playing around him better, because he excites the fans, and because he has the opportunity to build something great here.  He's ambitious, yes, but not greedy (e.g. he doesn't just want trophies if it means he has to be waste away on the bench at a ""better"" team).  He knows he's talented, but he also knows that a team like Spurs - if managed right and with the right players - can achieve incredible things.

&gt; There can be no more intimate and elemental part of the individual than his or her own consciousness. At the deepest level, our consciousness is what we are—to the extent that if we are not sovereign over our own consciousness then we cannot in any meaningful sense be sovereign over anything else either. So it has to be highly significant that, far from encouraging freedom of consciousness, our societies in fact violently deny our right to sovereignty in this intensely personal area, and have effectively outlawed all states of consciousness other than those on a very narrowly defined and officially approved list. The “War on Drugs” has thus unexpectedly succeeded in engineering a stark reversal of the true direction of Western history by empowering faceless bureaucratic authorities to send armed agents to break into our homes, arrest us, throw us into prison, and deprive us of our income and reputation simply because we wish to explore the sometimes radical, though always temporary, alterations in our own consciousness that drugs facilitate. The reason the anti-marijuana campaigns have failed is that millions of users know from their own direct, long-term experience that marijuana does not do them any great harm and (with reference to the most recent anti-marijuana propaganda) most definitely does not drive them mad.
Other than being against arbitrary rules that the state has imposed on us, personal drug use by adults is not a “crime” in any true moral or ethical sense and usually takes place in the privacy of our own homes, where it cannot possibly do any harm to others. For some it is a simple lifestyle choice. For others, particularly where the hallucinogens such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT are concerned, it is a means to make contact with alternate realms and parallel dimensions, and perhaps even with the divine. For some, drugs are an aid to creativity and focussed mental effort. For others they are a means to tune out for a while from everyday cares and worries. But in all cases it seems probable that the drive to alter consciousness, from which all drug use stems, has deep genetic roots. - Graham Hancock.

And while sometimes it may be a good idea to give information to the police about certain things, in this case I used my right to discretion and decided it was not in anybodys best interests to volunteer the information the police wanted.

Of course the vast majority of people who choose to have this haircut would not be  gang members, and the chances of it being used as a gang symbol within most schools is quite low, however, there are several other related reasons it is often banned.

First, actual gang members might mistake the haircut for a gang symbol and attempt to cause trouble while the students are arriving or leaving school. 

Second, local residents might mistake the children for gang members, which can cause problems between the schools and local people. 

The chances of it being a real problem is quite low, but when children's safety is a concern, it is often better to err on the side of caution. These rules are in place for the safety and well being of the students, and the school in general.

&gt;The analogies to Versailles and ww2 are completely inappropriate.

&gt;why are the analogies to Versailles inappropriate?

I then came along and asked which war you were talking about, making a sarcastic reference to WW2 which was part of the discussion, and was expecting you to justify how that is also inappropriate. Then you started to be rude.

If your actual argument here is that Germany being forgiven the Versailles debt was fair, because it was punitive and them being forgiven the WW2 debt is irrelevant and this somehow makes you right?

This is all not even taking into account player age, which has a large influence on the wage market.

Those who seem to get specially outraged at halal slaughter really distress me - it seems like they're using a completely correct line of reasoning (treating animals poorly is bad) to instrumentally bash Muslims rather than following that logic to a sensible conclusion (therefore I should try and reduce animal suffering where possible)",null,0,null,1422636764,null,0,false,0,co5ukad,null,t3_2u6i0o,null,t1_co5ukad,null,t1_co5tma6,null,null,null,1424305019,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Lennon is wasted space and unnecessary because we have 2 decent to good right sided midfielders. The priority should be to get a LW to keep Chadli motivated and to back him up in the case of like the last 2 weeks, he can't play. Ideally, I would like one with a better resume than those we've been linked with, but we do need someone here. 

With CMs, it would probably be the same case that I listed for CB. Buy 1, call somebody up from the development squad. 

As for striker, that's another priority, I would say Benteke should be sought after with much intensity. Ings maybe too. Can't say for certain. 

I think this first year is Poch's trial run. I don't want to say a fire sale will happen. but I think in the summer window, we might see him taking over transfers and getting a lot more involved with who he might want and who he'll want gone. its very possible that a large crop gets shipped out but we could be very wrong, all we can do is see.

I spent 3 hours with another IFA this morning, the third I've spoken to in the last week.

Depressingly, only one of the three companies (the last) hasn't tried to persuade me that active funds are best.

On defensive asset allocation, one was a total cowboy while the other two have both moved largely/completely out of gilts to chase yield in riskier assets (central bank mission accomplished!).

Both had significant current allocations to actively managed ""cautious absolute return"" funds, which sounds to me like a terrible idea.  Looks to me like they're essentially saying ""we don't know what to do so we'll pay someone else your money to do something we don't fully understand and hope that he has superpowers - while we still charge you 1% on top because reasons.""  Even the IFA who told me they didn't like active funds had a 32.5% allocation to CAR funds in their medium risk portfolio!

On the commodity side, I slightly miscommunicated what I'm considering.  The specific commodity indices I was looking at are actually sectoral equity indices (e.g. oil and gas production and exploration companies).  So they are income-producing but only proxies for the underlying commodity prices (or, rather, for changing expectations of long run commodity prices).  

I agree that one can't say whether oil (or oil companies) will go up or down from this point (recent noises from the Saudis suggest relative stability is most likely but who knows?).  However, that's not the point of the investment.  It's there to provide a hedge against one specific and significant source of inflation.  The fact that it also delivers, all else being equal, an equity risk/return is a nice bonus.

But I take your point.

I think I understand the issues reasonably well now.  I now just have to take a call and remind myself that, as long as I'm not doing anything that departs hugely from conventional wisdom, the precise asset allocation doesn't actually matter all that much.

At least 7 hours with three IFAs has helped me make up my mind to self-manage.  Whatever I invest in, returns look very likely to be low by historical standards, so the IFA's 1-2% fee (plus the extra fees from the CAR funds they've thrown my money at) could easily turn out to be 50-100% of my profits.

Potentially, but if your question is in the context of tomorrow's match, I don't think he's ready for a game of such magnitude. He's always impressive, albeit imperfect in his appearances, and his occasional errors - the header that went backwards and temporarily let Sterling through, or when Coutinho left him for dead - strike me as a need for more time in games of lesser importance; I'm a little wary of seeing Aguero go up against him.

null,false,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,null,"I haven't read much theology and I'm not quoting anyone but I've given some thought to this.

If God doesn't exist then none of this really matters - there's no such thing as good and evil, there's simply organisms competing with other organisms to survive - and killing a rival species or living off them parasitically is part of that.

If God does exist and he's evil, why would he allow good things to occur? Why would he allow us to exist at all... but more to the point - if he was evil wouldn't he simply fry atheists with lightning bolts for defying him? I mean, if I was an evil God, then as soon as someone was brave enough to declare ""I'm an atheist"" I'd be inflicting them with cancer, killing all their family or some other such show of my strength and their weakness.

If God exists and he is good... then why would he allow evil? Well, if I was a good God, I'd like to think I was big enough to ignore atheists and not feel the need to demonstrate my power or crush their will. I would like to think that I could get people to believe in me without having to show off all the time... and in due course inspire them to creativity and greatness with the brains I created rather than manipulating and controlling them.

But the greater answer I think lies in the fact that it matters not whether God is evil or not... if he/she/it does exist, and ergo some kind of afterlife does exist - if followers truly live *forever* in another state; then the short pain experienced in physical life, is insignificant compared to the following life everlasting - after the transformation of death. It would be like a 5 year old child complaining of a bee-sting - being is the most painful thing they've experienced in their short lifespan... an adult will acknowledge the pain and offer comfort, maybe treat it - but ultimately it's insignificant in the grand scheme of things.",null,0,null,1422638821,null,0,false,0,co5vsz2,null,t3_2u6v5i,null,t1_co5vsz2,null,t1_co5v03c,null,null,null,1424304439,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

We got a penalty against Chelsea and Andros Townsend immediately ran over and grabbed the ball to make sure no one else got it. The narrative there was good on the lad for having the confidence and taking the responsibility on, not ""putting himself before the team."" When a player is in the kind of form that Mirallas was in, it's not uncommon to have so much confidence that he wants the responsibility FOR the team and trusts himself more than anyone else to score.

Jesus said that the Sun rises, and the rain falls on the good and the bad.

null,false,ImNegative,lfcwfmm,,null,"Do you have a source that we are not doing good with FFP? From my knowledge we are not looking good with FFP because the champions league + Suarez finances have not been accounted for. 

I agree that if a player is highly sought after then it's harder for a club like us to attract them, but the problem is we are never in the race. We always try and undercut and get a cheap deal (see sanchez,  Mkhitaryan, Konoplyanka, Deigo costa), if we would actually put up the extra 4m - 10m in these types of deals we might actually get the player instead of just missing out. 

Now to Pjanic, I see no reason why we can't get a player like Pjanic. He's 24, best years ahead of him.  already a top player but has the potential to be absolute class. Why does that work for us? Well he's not the type of player that is going to start for Barca, Madrid, Bayern, so they're not our competition. I believe if we put up the money for him (which again should be affordable for us 25m -40m) we have a decent chance, he'll come into our squad as a very important starter in a young champions league competitive squad with bags of potential.  

But again to even be in with a chance of getting a player like Pjanic, we need to acutally make an acceptable bid. I don't remember FSG ever competing against another club financially even when we did have the money, it seems our philosphy is to try and get him cheap if we can't move on to the next.

Nope. In fact I specifically stated in my comment that he is guilty. The argument isn't about if she gave consent or not. It's whether she was [i]able[/i] to give consent after drinking as much as is claimed.

The rest of your comment is just putting words in my mouth. No, I'd not have you believe that she's lying about memory loss and I never said she was. I was simply putting across what was said in court.

I'm genuinely not being offensive when I say, isn't this exactly the thing you would come up with if you were trying to impose control on a primitive society?
