null,false,bzva74,null,null,null,"A few months ago I posted here about a girl in one of my classes who I went out with a few times. She had a boyfriend but was still hitting me up to hang and stuff, idk. Weird girl games I guess. Yall gave me some good advice, and I ended up taking some space. A little while later she got back in touch with me and everything got more flirtatious.

Fast forward a month to like Memorial Day weekend and she still has a boyfriend. They had a big fight and she came over and we slept together for the first time. Her emotions are all over the place, but at this point I want to date her so I need to get her away from her boyfriend, who is the sort of asshole who says that he will ruin her life if she leaves him. So she is terrified of him and they've been together for a few years so obviously there's a lot of history there I suppose. Last week she came back and spent the night again, so I thought she was maybe getting to make a decision.

On Sunday she came over again but didn't spend the night. And when she left she wouldn't kiss me goodnight. I suppose she felt that I would be her friend or boyfriend depending on her mood... So I had a talk with her reaffirming my intentions and it sort of freaked her out I guess and she got scared. I went a few days without talking to her while she came to terms with the fact that I don't want to be her friend, and while I don't expect her to dump her boyfriend immediately, she should realize the position I'm being put in here. She started texting me in the past few days and says she wants to meet up and talk after I take my exam tomorrow (I've been studying for the LSAT) but she says not to worry and that she misses me. I'm cautiously optimistic but she is so wishy washy and indecisive... Plus she lives with the boyfriend so like she can't keep this going indefinitely. 


Any of yall had experiences like this? How can I get her away from the manipulative and intimidating boyfriend? Physically and emotionally we have awesome chemistry, and it is clear that there are reciprocated feelings and tbh she is very much so the total package as far as I'm concerned, so I don't want to just leave her, but I don't want to be strung around either.

That said, first before talking about the economics you need to get the terminology right:

You can have debts without being broke. For example when you take out a mortgage you can afford to pay the repayments but you can't afford to pay off the whole mortgage.

In addition if you owe money but also own something of value you can sell that something if you have to. The government owns lots of stuff. There is some attempt to value this.

The government is currently both in debt (i.e. the stuff we have doesn't pay for what we owe). It is also in deficit (i.e. it gets less in it's paycheck than it spends at the supermarket).

The current aim is to reduce the deficit to zero and start running a surplus. ETA for this is 2019.

However by this point we will have accumulated a large debt. So when we have this surplus we may choose to pay down some of the debt, rather than do other stuff with the money.

Note that lots of commentators (especially outside the Treasury) get debt and deficit confused.

null,false,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"This article is basically attempting to conflate the existence of Jihadism with ISIS as a unique phenomena. This however is misleading: Let's look at this: 

&gt;It is true to say that the 2003 invasion of Iraq and its aftermath, namely the lack of a coherent post-war plan, created a vacuum which jihadist groups filled. It is also true to say that the alienation of the Sunni minority in Iraq, driven as much by Iranian influence and Nouri al-Maliki’s arrogance as US incompetence, helped create a fertile base for jihadist to recruit from.

1) there's a gap between 2003 and when Nouri Al Maliki took over as PM in 2006. In that we had Jafari, Haider Abadi and Iyad Alawi. Alawi wasn't pro Iran. 

2) In 2003 the most disastrous  decision was to disband the Iraq army and release thousands of trained soldiers into society without a plan to re-integrate. This helped form the basis of what is ISIS which is , funnily enough made up of former Baathists and Iraq soldiers 

https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/03/isis-forces-exbaathist-saddam-loyalists/

This makes it wholly a problem created by the invasion.

3). We know that the US has been funding opposition to Assad and the Gulf countries have been pouring in weapons to combat Assad.  Those people are , funnily enough , all heading towards ISIS. Again it's a problem we created 

4) In the suppression of the insurgency in Iraq - which happened in response to the invasion - the US created Camp Bucca , where most of the ISIS commanders and core leadership met. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story

This is a direct consequence of the invasion and the creation of ISIS.

5) The Us intervention split a unitary government into regions, with the Kurds getting serious investment in terms of Erbil and oil revenues, the South and Shia majoritty demanding self determination and the Sunni tribal areas suffering a sudden loss of power. This should have been a) foreseen and b) managed. It wasn't. the tension created , some of which were to divide and rule, left disenfranchised groups who split further as AQ became more powerful in Iraq.

6) As for Ansar Al Islam - the small time AQ affiliate - it operated in the north of Iraq , not the south. It had no constituency in places like Ramadi and Faluja. By 2003 it was a rump group of no consequence , talked up by people like Dick Cheney as a prelude to war.  

However as a result of the war, AQ members started appearing from other parts of the world, because it gave them a place to fight directly with the US and the UK. As a result, the invasion acted like a magnet for these groups to establish a foothold. 

So, the invasion in 2003 was responsible for ISIS. The US had a hand in either directly creating armed groups in Syria or indirectly as a consequence of the invasion.

null,false,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,null,"i've heard that argument, but to be honest, i don't agree with it, i think it's an excuse for companies being lazy at recruiting and paying poorly.


I've been working in IT for the best part of a decade and a half now. I've NEVER encountered a system that required that long to learn. I've worked public sector, private sector, high intensity financial 100% uptime systems, none of them have ever been that complicated. 



But my next point makes that argument irrelevant anyway. See, if an IT system is so complicated it's going to take that long to learn to support -  there's already a solution. It's called a support contract, and every vendor of IT systems will gladly sell you one. With those in place, you don't need rely on a single person. And if the company is frankly so misguided that they feel they should have a critical business system with no support contracts and then rely on a single in house person only to support it, then they aren't a company that anyone should be working for. What if that person is ill or gets hit by a bus ? there's no risk management or business continuity planning there at all, which is just crazy.



Also, the companies that have had 3 months notice  that I've worked at - they do nothing with it. I've seen friends work a 3 month notice, and nothing happens. Their bosses think they've got 3 months so they put it off and then panic to recruit someone ASAP in the last few weeks, it's really common.

At that point you have already plainly displayed your bias, and the fact you are just making propaganda rather than reasoned arguments.  

All you can see from this video is some very well maintained barns with a clean environment around them and a waste pool, a waste pool that looks perfectly well maintained and contained, there is no indication of anything else, you can't even see a pig in it, you can't even see any traces of a pig, or even really farm vehicular movement, that is far more odd than anything else, but that is what solid regulation brings. Their statements over the top, which are clearly bias, aren't going to sway a rational minded person in the slightest. 

Facts are it is obvious this video is a propaganda piece, and when I watch it all I see is a pretty well run farm. Then take the fact it is a propaganda piece that has nothing to do with the UK, not even the EU in fact, it is the USA a place with entirely different regulations of animal welfare, facts are the UK has some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world, for both farming and research.

Yes, I agree.

&gt;The fact he is second in line and the UK's next king do give him more power to be listed too, but the letters were handled like any other from the public about policy making

That is categorically untrue. If I wrote a letter to Ian Duncan Smith to ask him if I could get one of ""my people"" brief some of his people at the DWP about welfare reforms I would be surprised to even get a reply. The fact that he managed to do it, immediately tells me this wasn't handled like a normal request from your average Joe. Which it wouldn't be anyway, cos he is the heir to the throne in a constitutional monarchy. But that is wrong because he is meant to be impartial.

&gt;if you think Charles has more say than fortune 100 company CEO in the making of British policy you are both mistaken and naive. I only have to point you to the house of lords were ""unelected buffoons"" do directly affect policy and are CEOs and have agendas to act out.

That is also true but, alas, irrelevant as to whether Charles should have such a promiscuous and influential relationship with government ministers. The HoL is its own can of worms but that doesn't make what Charles did correct. 

The example of the CEO was only to highlight that we would not allow this kind of behaviour from other powerful and influential members of society so we really shouldn't allow it for the Royals.

What you've just stated is the same bullshit being fed everyone else that doesn't understand economics. The NHS hasn't seen a healthy investment at a time when the wave of people from the 60's baby boom is reaching age 50. 

This is a simple matter of supply and demand. The NHS is being reformed and underfunded at a time of high demand. Please stop repeating the lie that 'real terms' means it's being treated well.

your best option is going to be 3 - but their roaming only covers 18 countries, and it starts for £30/month (PAYG users have to pay extra for it, so you either have to have the £22/month 12 month contact, or the £30/month 30 day rolling contract). And of the unlimited data, you are only allowed to tether it to 4gb/month.

So you think market forces should drive animal welfare in farms 100%?  That's an interesting idea, how do you think that'll work out in the end?

Did you read the Wiki?  nothing in the video was exaggerated, or misrepresented, that's what intensive factory farming is, and I for one am glad that people are making films like this, reminding us of the true cost in animal suffering of cheap meat.

I would liken this kind of material to Exposés on the products of slave labour ending up in Western European high streets.  

We need to know how the stuff we consume is made, so we can know the true cost of it and can make an informed judgement based on the real facts, facts that some industries are very loathed to tell us about, because the reality would literally put us off our food and hurt their profits.

However, whenever I've spoken to them or read up on the matter, the majority seem more than happy to pay it because they know that their public services are some of the best in the world. I think it's Sweden, for example, that offers even more for free than our NHS does (dentistry and opticians are fully included).

She asserts that the bakery was motivated by homophobia to deny service because of the word gay.

Which is without basis a straight person ordering that cake would have been treated no diferently.

The judge then makes the verry faulty case that they would have served a cake saying 'support marrige'. The problem is that removing the word gay makes it a diferent product entirely.

The relevant question is would they serve that product to a straight person? All evidence implies they would not.

What saddened me is how dumbed down it all was. We did something in the first few months which I'd done in my BTEC 20 odd years earlier involving getting a robot to follow a line. It was to teach us programming and involved generating a flowchart in an application which then generated code itself that was programmed into a PIC chip on the robot. The last time I did that in my BTEC we had to design the flowchart and then write all the code by hand in 6502 assembler, convert to machine code then manually program it into a Emma II which controlled the bot. It was just one of many things which left me completely disillusioned. You'd be assigned 6hrs of workshop time to do an exercise which could be completed in under an hour.

You mean the one you edited into your post after I had written my reply that completely refuted your posted, no I didn't read that one, because it wasn't even on your original post. 

&gt; We need to know how the stuff we consume is made, so we can know the true cost of it and can make an informed judgement based on the real facts, facts that some industries are very loathed to tell us about, because the reality would literally put us off our food and hurt their profits. 

People make informed decisions everyday of the week, people know what factory farming is, people know their clothes are made by underpaid workers in the third world, they vote with their money, and their money says they don't care.

The irony of this whole subject is people trying to take a moral high ground on a subject of animals been grown to be killed and eaten, there is no moral high ground to be had, you are growing them to kill them, the whole idea of that is either more morally abhorrent than how they are kept in the first place, or a totally reasonable activity. Arbitrarily saying that the treatment of them is even relevant when you are growing them to kill them in the first place is just...eh...well, what I said, arbitrary. Then to take that premise even further to reductio ad absurdum, plants are alive, where are the people crying about how they are treated, bacteria are alive, why no tears for them, you kill billions of them everyday you do anything, and when have you ever try to culture them or treat them nicely, I mean what a bastard, you completely ignore their plight, what because they aren't eukaryotes, because you can't see them? Does that make them no longer deserving of your arbitrary moral compass? In the end the solution is simple, kill yourself because you are killing billion of organisms everyday just going about your day. 

I personally don't agree with the ideals of factory farming, but it is an economic issue, that until solved economically is a function of society, if people can't afford to be nicer, because they need to eat and should have the right to a reasonable standard of diet, then humans come first. Then there is the fact that from an economic perspective you clearly aren't even on the level to the bias about it, as seen here:

&gt;So you think market forces should drive animal welfare in farms 100%? 

I just suggested introducing a living wage to stop the need for people having to have such a cheap source of food and you suggest that is something to do with market forces having 100% control? A living wage is the exact of opposite of market forces, it is creating a false equilibrium point on the labour market, that is by definition the opposite of allowing market forces to do their work, it is inherently interfering with them doing it, you don't even know enough about that subject to be bias about it. This is forgetting that once again your complete bias attitude is apparent once again, completely disregarding the locality of this video and that the regulations and laws in the UK for animal welfare are different, and are some of the strongest in the world, which have no point have I ever given a opinion on, I have never said whether they are good or bad, yet you still try to attack on this premise, so you are just ignoring the facts once again, just like the bias people in this video.

&gt; Not everything can be properly measured by how much money it costs, but if it's too cheap, there's usually some poor animal or human paying the real price.

Go tell that to insurance companies who have quite literally put a price on every single part of the human body, and then the life insurance ones who have put it on death. 

You are just as bias as the person who made the video, and I think anyone reading this will be able to see that is plainly obvious as well.

Unless you attempt to quantify this by answering the above, and I don't think it would be particularly enlightening, you simply can't make such statements.  The only conclusion I can really draw from the article is that the BBC's impartiality is heavily scrutinised; which is no surprise considering it is a public body, funded by the government, commenting on political matters.

Essentially, people can have their own opinions on the bias of the BBC.  I for example think that it is fairly representative of the UK political landscape, if not slightly to the left of it.  I feel BBC articles are worded fairly impartially and that any bias emerges from the information it chooses to show or not, and how much of it, rather than the articles themselves.  

For example, the issue of Scotland, the SNP, and the referendum.  The articles that the BBC published over the last few years on these matters were largely factually correct, and any mistakes they did make were mostly amended.  However, the shear increase in information published which supported the No argument when the Yes campaign started polling ahead was noticeable.  If I hadn't run out of tinfoil this morning, I would argue that it was a clear example of GCHQ powers to control information in the event of a ""threat to UK security"", in use, as outlined in the leaked Snowden documents.  A tinfoil-less me would put this down to the fact that the people of the UK as a whole largely sided with the No campaign and the BBC simply reflected that sentiment.  However there is the argument that it was a Scottish issue and BBC Scotland should have reflected the sentiment of Scottish people when presenting the information in a way that was fair to the idea of self determinism.  And then you have the ridiculous reporting of the first few days of SNP in parliament.  Rather than highlight the fact that they were pretty much the only buggers to turn up, they decide to focus on the fact that they were told off for clapping, a particular argument used by those in the media who are attempting to portray them as disruptive and anti-Westminster.  Did the BBC say this?  No.  Does this make them impartial?  I would argue not, but then I think it is impossible to be impartial enough that you wont get these complaints.",null,0,null,1433510564,null,0,false,0,crweo2r,null,t3_38nggc,null,t1_crweo2r,null,t1_crwcl8a,null,null,null,1436750330,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

All i hear is we need 1st teamers and all i see is us fuckin around with 1st team targets. For instance we look desperate for a right back so we're chasing clyne, if he's the one we want get him. We had bid rejected now we're messing about again? Show intent and get him signed before man utd get in there.

This article raises some questions that need to be answered and any Liverpool fan that has supported the club before the Hicks and Gillet era will want them answered. We used to be a club that did things the right way. We had a philosophy that was successful and it permeated the club from the boot room to the board room.

FSG have done ok since they took over. They are trying to do things the right way but their lack of experience in managing a football club is obvious to anyone. They originally wanted a DoF, then decided they didn't. They wanted to only sign players u24 with potential and high sell on value, then they bought Lambert and now Milner. Not knocking those signings, it just highlights a lack of consistency and makes it look like they are not sure what they are doing.

They need to have more people involved in running the club that know what they are talking about in regards to football. If BR is their man, he should be in charge of the running of the squad. He shouldn't have to go through a transfer committee that has members that know more about business than scouting players.

My take on their questions are this:

1. We don't know what happened in the review meeting. They obviously had their reasons to stick with BR and that's fine by me but he will have to be backed. The ramifications of this meeting will be made clear over the summer when we see what happens with transfers and within the hierarchy of the coaching staff.

2. It's a fair question, FSG are new to this and are learning as they go. We just have to patient and there are already signs that they are learning and adapting to football.

3. It's a bit of an unfair question. FSG put in place a young manager and he brought in a young staff. You can't have youth and experience.

4. This is the crux of the problem for this season. We knew Suarez wanted out the summer before he left. We clinched CL qualification early in Suarez's last season. That was the time to go out and sign a player of Sanchez's calibre. Again, this is down to FSG's inexperience and naiveté. We could have easily signed Lacazette that summer for about 20-25m for one example. 

5. It's the same question as 4 really

6. Also a reasonable question. It wasn't a position that was needed to be filled unless BR didn't rate Sakho. BR said he wanted a leader, yet sold Agger. The rationale here escapes me.

7. FSG are dealing with this internally, like they should. I don't have a problem with that either but again, we need to see results this window and in the future. Another window like last season will be a disaster and if Benteke and Ings are the pinnacle of our transfer ambitions for new strikers, we will be in trouble next season.

8. Yeah, I don't really care if John Henry isn't at every game. But the sending off for Gerrard was handled really poorly. By everyone at the club especially the players.

9. It's an important area to get right. Again it points to FSG's inexperience operating in football. Realistic transfer targets need to be identified and signed quickly and quietly. Look at how we handled the Salah transfer for example. We were interested for nearly a year. We eventually pull the trigger with a ridiculously low bid that alerted everybody to our interest and Chelsea swooped in.

Relevant bit of wikipedia:

&gt;Another component of the ritual is the slaughter of water buffalo. The more powerful the person who died, the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast. Buffalo carcasses, including their heads, are usually lined up on a field waiting for their owner, who is in the ""sleeping stage"". Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey and that they will be quicker to arrive at Puya if they have many buffalo. Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundreds of pigs using a machete is the climax of the elaborate death feast, with dancing and music and young boys who catch spurting blood in long bamboo tubes. Some of the slaughtered animals are given by guests as ""gifts"", which are carefully noted because they will be considered debts of the deceased's family. However, a cockfight, known as bulangan londong, is an integral part of the ceremony. As with the sacrifice of the buffalo and the pigs, the cockfight is considered sacred because it involves the spilling of blood on the earth. In particular, the tradition requires the sacrifice of at least three chickens. However, it is common for at least 25 pairs of chickens to be set against each other in the context of the ceremony.

Agreed, but if Mignolet plays like he did from September-January I wouldn't trust Bogdan.  

&gt;Caballero didn't push Hart, don't be ridiculous.  

Caballero was very good in the cups, if Harts form dropped then he could have easily taken his space.

&gt;Who was pushing Van Der Saar?  Who pushed Foster?  Lloris? Buffon?

With the exception of Foster those players are good enough to be guaranteed a starting place, Mignolet is nowhere near good enough to be a guaranteed starter.   

&gt;I know Mignolet isn't great but he almost won golden gloves with the shit defense in front of him.  

Woljech Sczesny won it one year, its not a good judge of goalkeepers. 

&gt;He is probably the third or fourth best shot stopper in the league and has improved, quite a bit, from two years ago in terms of distribution and aerial control. 

De Gea, Courtois, Cech, Lloris, Ospina, Begovic and Adrian I would argue are better shotstoppers but that is one of Mignolets strong points.

&gt;Bogdan is an upgrade.  Do you remember when Brad Jones played?

I'm not sure he is, considering he was a backup at Bolton  

&gt;Do you remember how bad he was?  He is a stop gap until Ward or Vigouroux can step up into the role which for Ward may be a year or two.  

Neither are good enough nor will be good enough tbh

We will work with any group of people to further our aims whether they be de-stabilising a region, securing access to natural resources or disrupting our enemies access to them.

Well, the rise of ISIS in Libya, Syria and Iraq is clearly an incredibly complex issue. I think the term ""good guy"" is relative in such a situation. Here's what we do know:

Assad rules an authoritarian state where his religious group, the Alawites (Who make up roughly 13-14% of the population if I remember correctly) dominate politics, the military, the civil service etc. He and his father have committed atrocities such as the use of chemical weapons against his own people, and has been prepared to massacre those who call for democracy. He's a bad guy.

Gaddafi and his sons ruled over Libya with military force, he sold Semtex to the IRA at the height of the Troubles and was about to massacre the people of Benghazi and would have, if it wasn't for NATO intervention in 2011. 

Saddam Hussein was essentially the head of a massive crime family. He invaded Kuwait, bombed Israel, Gases the Kurds and oppressed the  Shia majority in Iraq. Christopher Hitchens once described his regime as ""A concentration camp above ground and a mass grave beneath it"". He's a bad guy.

I'd say compared to pretty much every other major figure involved in conflict in the Middle East, we *are* the good guys. ",null,0,null,1433514110,null,0,false,0,crwggum,null,t3_38nabm,null,t1_crwggum,null,t1_crwb2xj,null,null,null,1436751794,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,SpecialPudding,null,null,null," I was in a very similar situation to you when I moved out from a god awful, but very cheap house share aged 23. I had spent 4 years there putting myself through uni and working several part time jobs. As soon as I got my first full time job I escaped and started renting a house for £450 a month. My take home pay was £950 a month.

My bills worked out like this:

* £450 rent
* £90 Council Tax
* £70 Gas &amp; Elec
* £100 Car Savings (This paid for tax, insurance, MOT, servicing and emergency repairs each year!)
* £10 mobile
* £5 internet/phone
* £50 a month saved to pay for phone line rental / contents insurance - I always paid for these in one big chunk rather than monthly as it saves you £££s! (same with car insurance)
* £15 - Union 
* £5  - Charity

This left me with about £150 a month for every thing else. This was a challenge to live on - and my budget left little margin for error and no room for savings. I mastered the art of groceries for £10 - 15 a week at the start, I lived close to work so my petrol was low and I didn't go out much and found cheap hobbies.

Things got easier, my wages nearly doubled over the 4 years I was renting, but I pretty much stuck to the original budget which meant I found saving the extra easy!  (Ok, I now spend nearly £30 a week on food - luxury!)

I do think I was very lucky in the first couple of ears not to have any massive emergencies, and I rented the same place for 4 years so I didn't have to deal with all the expense and hassle of moving after I had done it for the first time.

The increase in wages and a lot of luck is what really made this feasible in the long term for me, so if your luck holds out it might be do-able, you will be living in very tight margins. it will give your frugal muscles a good work out though! How likely is it that your earnings will increase over the next few years?

""""he [Saddam] murdered as many as a million of his people, many with poison gas. He tortured, maimed and imprisoned countless more. His unprovoked invasion of Iran is estimated to have left another million people dead. His seizure of Kuwait threw the Middle East into crisis. More insidious, arguably, was the psychological damage he inflicted on his own land. Hussein created a nation of informants — friends on friends, circles within circles — making an entire population complicit in his rule""""

""During the 1991 rebellion, several ""dungeons"" were liberated, revealing ""disoriented and confused"" inmates that believed Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was still the president.[15] Of nearly 2 million refugees created by the 1991 crackdown on dissent, it is estimated that 1,000 died every day for a period of months due to unsanitary and inhumane conditions.[16] The destruction of Shi'ite religious shrines by Hussein's regime has been called ""comparable to the levelling of cities in the Second World War, and the damage to the shrines [of Hussein and Abbas] was more serious than that which had been done to many European cathedrals.""[17] Methods of torture used by Hussein's regime included assault with brass knuckles and wooden bludgeons; electric shocks to the genitalia; scorched metal rods being forced into body orifices; the crushing of toes and removal of toenails; burning off limbs; lowering prisoners into vats of acid; poisoning with thallium; raping women in front of their family members; burning with cigarette butts; the crushing of bones; the amputation of ears, limbs, and tongues; and the gouging of eyes.[18] After the 1983-88 genocide, some 1 million Kurds were allowed to resettle in ""model villages"". According to a U.S. Senate staff report, these villages ""were poorly constructed, had minimal sanitation and water, and provided few employment opportunities for the residents. Some, if not most, were surrounded by barbed wire, and Kurds could enter or leave only with difficulty.""""

null,false,Blubbey,null,null,null,"&gt;In the attack, when Rose comes up should he overlap into the corner or stay back and let Chadli go deeper?

Depends where Chadli would be. If he's inside, overlapping is obvious. If he's already on the edge of the pitch but only about halfway into their half overlapping is an option but providing an option inside (say for a 1-2 to Chadli to run onto down the wing) could also be fine. If Chadli's near the corner flag obviously no point overlapping.

&gt;In defense, how far back do the mid usually go

Again depends on the situation and what's needed. If there're one of their players running through past them, they should track the runner. If  there's a gap left in the middle (say Vlad's gone on a run and he's lost the ball) one of them should fill in that spot.

&gt;Also if a ball goes into the corner, where do other players rotate I defend?

Attacking (holding it up, wasting time) or defending it you mean?

Random scenario I made up. Defending against the blue team, from top to bottom it's Rose/Chadli/Vert/Dier/Walker/Lamela with Bentaleb and Mason on the edge. Ideally, Chadli should fill in the space between Vert and Rose because otherwise it stretches the back line too much, leaves too many holes and Rose could be easily done if they have two players there. So for example in that pic, I'm saying Rose is holding up a player, another player goes beyond Rose (who Chadli should track). The attacking players are expecting a cross so a striker makes a run onto the 6 yard box (Dier tracking/Vert getting in front if it's a low cross), a run to the back post covered by Lamela with Walker in front and possibly a run in from a midfielder onto the penalty spot (ish) with Bentaleb covering the guy hovering on the edge.",null,0,null,1433514384,null,0,1433514634,0,crwgmem,null,t3_38o628,null,t1_crwgmem,null,t3_38o628,null,null,null,1436751918,null,15,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,15,null

More insidious, arguably, was the psychological damage he inflicted on his own land. Hussein created a nation of informants — friends on friends, circles within circles — making an entire population complicit in his rule"".[9] Other estimates as to the number of Iraqis killed by Saddam's regime vary from roughly a quarter to half a million,[10][11] including 50,000 to 182,000 Kurds and 25,000 to 280,000 killed during the repression of the 1991 rebellion.[12][13] Estimates for the number of dead in the Iran-Iraq war range upwards from 300,000.[14]

Are you willing to raise or purchase game for your lynx to hunt on a regular basis? Calves and deer are appropriate. The lynx may eat as much as 2kg of meat a day, so you will need to provide up to 5kg of live game per day to account for bone weight and other losses.

&gt;The relevant question is would they serve that product to a straight person? **All evidence implies they would not**.

I'm not being facetious here, but could you please provide that evidence?

&gt;They also have the circumstantial evidence of a gay employee and other gay customers who they do not treat any less favourably.

Can you also provide this evidence? Which of their employees is gay, and which of their customers are gay? Is there actually anything to back that up, other than the defendants' word?

I am completely willing to change my view on this, but I have not seen anyone provide any actual proof of these claims - just ""they wouldn't have served a straight person - they have gay employees/customers"" based on literally nothing but their word.

&gt;Won't be long before some idiot tries to get a Muslim to produce pictures of muhammad and then cites this case. 

But that's an entirely separate matter, and one that is clearly ludicrous - it's not about refusing to serve someone based on the request, but based on their sexuality/gender/race.

This meant they had freedom to say whatever they liked about any car, without worrying about annoying advertisers. Also, no ad breaks, which makes any show better instantly.

The other versions of Top Gear on commercial stations didn't have this freedom.

So, while it's true that the chemistry between the trio made Top Gear unique, it was also 'being on the BBC' which did this too.

Unless the three of them can go to Netflix or something, it won't be as good of a show. If it was on ITV or Sky, it would be significantly worse, a 40 minute show instead of an hour long one, broken up by ads, with the presenters restricted with what they can say because they need to keep the advertisers happy.

Another bad run and there'll be Sami chants in no time.

Sami has been a manager already and it hasn't really worked out as well as he had hoped. He wouldn't even be assistant manager with us, he'd be a coach. If we had a hugely respected manager who'd seen it all then it would be more possible, but there isn't much of an age gap between Rodgers and Hyypia. Even though it would be a job with us, it would probably be another step backwards for him at this stage of his career.

Edit: Colin Pascoe getting sacked does open up the assistant manager position and may make this a little bit more likely.

Favorite companion: Donna. She was sassy and funny and had really great chemistry with Tennant.

From Belfast telegraph 

&gt;The court was told that Mr Lee was a regular customer at Ashers' Royal Avenue store in Belfast. In May last year he wanted to purchase a cake for a forthcoming event to mark Anti-Homophobia Day.

The guy suing was served before despite being gay. 

The prosecutions evidence comes down to feelings and the odd non sequitur. 

&gt;The gay activist at the centre of the Ashers Bakery row told a court he felt like a ""lesser person"" when the company refused to bake him a cake.

&gt;As the landmark civil case between religious freedom and equality rights got under way in Belfast yesterday, Gareth Lee said he was left to feel that he ""wasn't worthy"" because of his sexuality when his order for a cake endorsing gay marriage was cancelled by the Christian-run bakery.

This isn't relevant at all. What he feels is not substantiated by anything what so ever and the bakery is inoccent unless proven guilty.

&gt;Barrister Robin Allen QC, representing Mr Lee, presented a promotional leaflet which he claimed showed the firm was willing to produce Halloween cakes.

&gt;""Witches are hardly consistent with promoting Christian beliefs,"" Mr Allen said.

How could this possibly be relevant? The relevant question is was it the product or the customer that caused them to cancel the order.

Why do people think he should be given an improved contract? He's  by no means a great defender and last season looked great because he was protected on either side by another pair of CBs. He's been at the club a long time and has never managed to gel with another CB. He couldn't play in tune with Carra, Agger, Soto, Sami, Sakho or Lovren. Now make of what you will about the talent level of some of those guys. 

Skrtel keeps being referred to as ""senior"" and ""loyal"". Firstly I wouldn't call him loyal because we had to give him a massive hike in his wages in order to keep him away from Man City, after Agger rejected them. Then senior implies that he brings some level of leadership, which he does not. He isn't vocal on the pitch, and is a terrible organiser of a defence, so him being a senior player just means he's older because he doesn't possess any of the advantageous traits that older players sometimes have. Remember in Rodgers' first season when he was dropped for Carra in the run in? Last season he was pretty piss poor, and it annoys me that people think he's a great defender. We haven't had a good defence in a while, and Skrtel has been part of our defence the entire time it's been crap. I just think the signs are there. Sakho is our true best CB, and it's no secret that we need a new CB to partner him.

I'm not against giving him a new contract, but he's pulling the piss with his current wages (100k~), never mind improved wages and a long term deal.

null,false,Yaverland,english,London,null,"""Biased"" suggests the BBC has a political agenda. Whereas ""wonky"" suggests that they are somehow doing the job wrong, though not necessarily that there is an agenda behind the mistake. 

For instance, perhaps the BBC News site comes off as pro-government because it tends to be locked into reporting facts of what is actually happening or what is planned, which in turn tends to be dictated by the government and its agenda? Unlike the newspapers, which have the freedom to decide what's in their pages according to ideology. That's a structural problem rather than a problem of left wing producers or editors. In any case, it's one I reject. The BBC is one of the few organisations that bothers to run any length of conflicting quotes from opposing sources when they cover something, be it a government or opposition story they are reporting.

And the point still stands that there are so many conflicting claims about what the BBC is doing wrong and which side they are biased towards that it undermines the credibility of its detractors. If they think it's happening, let them prove it through objective evidence - a BBC internal memo saying, ""Let's make everyone hate the Tories"", or a political scientist who is able to demonstrate through data that they were pro-coalition.

&gt;This isn't relevant at all. What he feels is not substantiated by anything what so ever and the bakery is inoccent unless proven guilty.

If he felt that he was being refused service *because he was gay*, I'd say it's very relevant - and that's the crux of the argument - what proof is there that he was being refused service on the content of the product, and not his sexuality?

&gt;I can't find anything on their gay employee though wouldn't the lawyer be comitting perjury if it was a lie?

Only if it's actually found to be a deliberate lie. Is there any actual evidence anyone can point to, either way? Then why are people taking the defendants' word as the truth? That's my point.

I never said he was, his mistake was thinking he could get people to vote without having their religious and tribal elders endorse it.

&gt; I'm all on board with standing behind BR and FSG but that doesn't mean we can't question them. This article raises some questions that need to be answered and any Liverpool fan that has supported the club before the Hicks and Gillet era will want them answered. We used to be a club that did things the right way. We had a philosophy that was successful and it permeated the club from the boot room to the board room.

We most certainly can question them. But that doesn't mean it's good for the club for them to give us (or anyone else) any answers, apart from the league standings in May 2016.  

I wouldn't exactly classify the 1991-2007 period as hugely successful. Sure, 2001 and 2005 were great but that's in a 16-year period. H&amp;G under their tenure delivered a CL runners-up medal, a quarter final and a semi final. Things went sour at the end, but I wouldn't beat FSG with the stick of history - you just can't run a football club in 2015 the same way you ran it in 1985 (we tried to do that in the 90s and that didn't exactly work out). And the category of people who own football clubs has changed with the times. Still, despite all that, last season gave us our most credible title challenge since our last title - I would argue that outranks most of the 1991-2007 years. 

&gt; FSG have done ok since they took over. They are trying to do things the right way but their lack of experience in managing a football club is obvious to anyone. They originally wanted a DoF, then decided they didn't. They wanted to only sign players u24 with potential and high sell on value, then they bought Lambert and now Milner. Not knocking those signings, it just highlights a lack of consistency and makes it look like they are not sure what they are doing.

Sure, but they are also successful businessmen and know the sort of people they need to surround themselves with. A DoF is something many successful clubs use and, on paper, it is a very good solution. You could call it inconsistency, but perhaps they felt that what Rodgers could bring to the club outweighed their DoF imperative - in which case it's a sign of adapting to your situation and not inconsistency. 

As for player recruitment and the signings of Lamber and Milner, the 'buy young' general strategy is exactly that - a general strategy. To not buy *anyone* over 24 would not be consistency: it would be madness. 

&gt; They need to have more people involved in running the club that know what they are talking about in regards to football. If BR is their man, he should be in charge of the running of the squad. He shouldn't have to go through a transfer committee that has members that know more about business than scouting players.

This comes down to personal preference, but I disagree strongly here: I don't think Rodgers should be in charge of transfers. You talk about experience - it is here where I would prefer someone with experience of recruiting good talent. Rodgers has neither the experience nor the track record for that and his *supposed* signings (Borini, Lovren, Allen) seem to be a testament to that. Of course, Allen is increasingly proving his worth, but not enough to justify sole control over signings for Rodgers. 

And I mean, that makes sense - it's hard to find someone who is excellent at everything. A manager ought to manage his team - tactics, training, motivation. But a great manager rarely makes a great scout and this is why so many clubs opt for a DoF. That is not to say Rodgers shouldn't have input - he most definitely should - but, again, I would strongly argue against him being in charge of transfers. 

&gt; We could have easily signed Lacazette that summer for about 20-25m for one example.

How do you know this? 

&gt; Also a reasonable question. It wasn't a position that was needed to be filled unless BR didn't rate Sakho. BR said he wanted a leader, yet sold Agger. The rationale here escapes me.

Agger was sold because he couldn't get through a single season uninjured. I thought that was pretty clear at the time and I think it was a very sensible move. That left Skrtel, an ageing Carragher and a very young Sakho as our CB pairings. The club seemed to want to find an experienced replacement for Carragher and apparently Lovren is the man Rodgers and the committee wanted. Leader-like qualities, good injury record, PL experience, good season behind him - sure, makes sense on paper. But that transfer clearly did not work out - these things happen. There are lessons to be learned, but hardly an 'off with their heads!' scenario. 

&gt; FSG are dealing with this internally, like they should. I don't have a problem with that either but again, we need to see results this window and in the future. Another window like last season will be a disaster and if Benteke and Ings are the pinnacle of our transfer ambitions for new strikers, we will be in trouble next season.

Results are imperative and will ultimately seal Rodgers' fate. I (and I assume all of us) agree with you there. We don't need 'big name signings' as such, I don't think - and I don't think we can attract them in our current state. But we need good players to fit our system. As such, Benteke might be an excellent fit. I personally don't think he would be a great success here, but I've seen many people put forward a very good argument for his case, so I'll happily be proven wrong. Ings is one for the future - hardly a signing I'll fault the club for, considering his price. 

&gt; But the sending off for Gerrard was handled really poorly. By everyone at the club especially the players.

How so? Personally, I thought the whole thing was way over the top, so it'd be interesting to hear the other side. 

&gt; It's an important area to get right. Again it points to FSG's inexperience operating in football. Realistic transfer targets need to be identified and signed quickly and quietly. Look at how we handled the Salah transfer for example. We were interested for nearly a year. We eventually pull the trigger with a ridiculously low bid that alerted everybody to our interest and Chelsea swooped in.

Inexperience here does seem to play a part, I'd concur. Salah was a massive shambles (and Willian), but in this day of agents and espionage, I doubt he was pried away just because our bid was low - Chelsea were probably monitoring him for as long as we have. There's a big dilemma here, I imagine - do you scout a player for longer, to make sure he'll be a good fit, whilst increasing the chance of a more attractive club sweeping in, or do you sign early to increase your chances but run the risk of signing the wrong guy? It's a difficult balance to get right - hopefully we're on track to find it.

null,false,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt;it's about how their power structures have worked for centuries

Actually if you start with this you've lost

Let me enumerate the reasons why:

a) there are no such things as ""ancient power structures"" it's orientaist garbage that belongs in the realm of Gibbon and Bernard Lewis and should be jetisonned. 

b) the region's power structures were new, they were enforced via coloniasm, and before the the Ottoman's reforms in the 19th century  based on - wait for it - the reforms of 19th century Europe.

c) ""reformers"" like Mohmmad Abdu, Jallaluddin Afghani, Shariati the elder, and various others had been working with ideas of democracy and accountability in the 19th century and early 20th. It was their grass routes movements that were stiffled by colonialism. This was local reform with local ideas of democracy that was proposed. 

d) Iraq had it's own democracy movement and self determination movement crushed by the British in the 1920s. 

e)_ concepts of Shurah and democracy go back as far as 650Ad and were prominent well into the 10th century, when combination of admiration for Rome, and the arrival of turkik dynasties brought about a top down version of governance. Even then, the idea of scholarly independence and the rule of law is enshrined in all forms of Islamic codex laws of the period since. 

f) Ibn Khaldun's Maqadimah discusses the concepts of power and participation and was actually influential on western thinkers. 

So , I haven't lost the argument. I actually know what I'm talking about. 

&gt;He probably could have managed to create a semi-stable state, suitable to American interests, if he hadn't been obsessed with trying to force democracy on a society not prepared for it. 

This is nonsense as well. There were large and active Iraqi democracy groups around at the time both in Iraq and in the west  -that Bremmer and the neocons refused to talk to.  Bremmer#s own plan for reconstruction was only made more democratic by the intervention of Ali Sistani ( of all people) who refused to have a sectarian system of the likes of Lebanon enforced on it.

&gt; INTER CAUSING TROUBLE
&gt; 
&gt; **Mateo Kovačić agreed terms with the Reds, but Inter's not satisfied even with 21 million euros**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Mateo Kovačić has played his last game for Inter, that's the only thing that's certain
&gt; 
&gt; Even though he's being wisely quiet about it, Mateo Kovačić (21) has played his farewell game in Inter's shirt. And it all came perfectly for him: manager Roberto Mancini has been looking for some time for a new solution in the midfield, and at the same time Liverpool's sparked interest for Mateo.
&gt; 
&gt; After Mateo Kovačić already agreed terms with the English club, the only thing left is agreement between clubs, but at the moment it's not even close. The Reds' offer, as well informed Italians say, yesterday rose up to undreamt 21 million euros, which is not enough for Inter.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Summer-long soap-opera**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Italians are of course in no rush with selling Mateo, as they know that Rogers (should he stay the manager of Liverpool) up the price as he's labeled Kova as Gerrard's successor. Inter's logic can't be more understandable: if Reds gave more than 25 million euros for Lovren, why would such a noble midfielder like Mateo be worth less?
&gt; 
&gt; The deal between Inter and Liverpool around Mateo could, then, turn into a summer-long soap-opera, something similar to Luka's transfer to Real Madrid.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, the imagination of Liverpool's fans was already tickled by Dejan Lovren by posting on his profile a photo with his future team-mate Mateo Kovačić. Liverpool's tandem of 50 million euros!
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of Mateo, it's not surplus to mention that Modrić's injury has promoted him into nearly the key player of the national team before the clash with Italians.

Players also have yearly wage rise clauses, and for all we know he could have had a clause that raised his wages due to getting CL last year. 

Well your Baines example isn't very good, because an assist stat doesn't relate to defenders exclusively. All stats have to be taken with a grain of salt, and the only one that matters is the league table at the end of the day. When people start throwing around average ratings, goals, assists etc. it gets a bit worrying, because none of these are related to a player's actual ability to defend or anything. You mention Carra and Terry as if Skrtel is in the same class as them, when he's really very very far off both. Carra and Terry never had overwhelming physical abilities, so their natural ability to just defend the frickin ball helped them a lot. Skrtel isn't the best positionally, he's poor defending set pieces, he can't organise a defence and he doesn't bark out orders. These are all things that you'll still want an old declining defender to be able to do. His mental side of the game is extremely lacking.

Saying 34 for a player who isn't pulling any trees up at the moment is very iffy. We need to improve our defence, but settling with Skrtel isn't going to help us whatsoever I'm afraid.

To his credit, I would have liked to see him play that wide left role he prefers and played a lot at Fiorentina. Maybe he could have gotten a feel in England better out wide - cutting in, and finding 1-2s with the backs. Now, I really cannot see a future in which Jovetic is in blue - especially one where he contributes as a blue.

null,false,Puddock,null,null,null,"I totally get the distinction between suffering and killing. Personally, I don't like the idea of killing an otherwise healthy, young animal, but I do understand the argument being made. Killing is such a small part of the process, and can be made very quick and relatively painless. In an ideal world, animals would be raised well and wouldn't even know what hit them. And that's so, so much better than what we do right now. 

The problem is that, in business, welfare costs money. There will always be suffering so long as we are willing to allow it by paying for low cost products. The UK actually has some excellent welfare laws, which is really good. Outside of the UK though, it's very hard to figure out where meat has come from, and if it's been treated well. If horse meat can make it into the beef sector then it's obvious how easily the system is undermined and we absolutely have no idea if ethical standards are being met when we import food. That's why it's so important to be selective when buying animal products if you care about welfare.

On top of the welfare argument is the environmental one. We consume too much meat; it's not good for our environment and as a society we really should be cutting down. Again, it's not necessarily black or white, it's just a case of skipping out on cheap meats and reducing overall consumption.

In terms of going veggie, I lost about a stone when I went vegan initially, because I dropped eggs and dairy and didn't replace that food with good equivalents. It was a subtraction and not a substitution. I gained most of the weight back, and could now actually stand to lose a little again. I learnt that I like tofu now that I can cook the stuff, and it opened up a whole new world of cuisines for me. I eat a lot of asian, african and indian inspired dishes. I also learned how to make vegan versions of old staples like cottage pie, fish and chips and lasagne. It takes time, it's not easy, but once you know how to do it then you can get by very nicely. Veggies are actually not that important, calorie wise veggies don't contribute an awful lot. You need to eat them for the bulk factor and fibre, but the types you eat won't matter too much.

If you want any recipes or anything, feel free to PM me but you don't need to go as far as being veggie if it makes you uncomfortable, choosing veggie just a few times a week is still enough to amount to a large difference over a year or a lifetime. If everybody did it, we would reduce the demand for cheap meat considerably.",null,0,null,1433523324,null,0,false,0,crwm69e,null,t3_38mpff,null,t1_crwm69e,null,t1_crwl6th,null,null,null,1437570778,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Believe it or not, there are plenty of rich vegan gravys and plant based butters which really do hit the spot and once you are used to the diet, you find richness, texture and flavour in new places. But it *is* hard to get started, it's hard to source the best alternatives and it is horrible for your social life - it stops you going out to eat as freely, and it sucks explaining yourself to others.

&gt;

&gt;The __Vetch Field__ was a [multi-purpose stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-purpose_stadium) in [Swansea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales). It was used mostly for [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) matches and was the home ground of [Swansea City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C.) until the club moved to the newly built [Liberty Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Stadium) in 2005. Opened in 1912, the ground held around 12,000 at the time of its closure, but upwards of 30,000 at its peak.

&gt;As well as being home to the Swans, the Vetch also hosted games for the [Wales national football team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_national_football_team), with 18 internationals played at the Vetch between 1921 and 1988.  Other sports also found a home at the Vetch, with 8 [rugby league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league) matches played there between 1990 and 1999.   In 1960, local boy [Brian Curvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Curvis) beat the Australian boxer [George Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Barnes_(boxer\)) at the Vetch to win the Commonwealth (British Empire) [Welterweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight) title. 

&gt;The stadium also operated as a music venue, hosting [The Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who) in [1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who_Tour_1976)  and [Stevie Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder) in 1984.

Tripper (RB) from Burnley - £3.5m. Has a buyout clause and has been very similar to Cresswell in a really shite team. Same age as Jenko I think, so he'll only get better. 

[Back up right back - no idea who] 

Obiang (midfielder) and Eder (Playmaker) from Sampdoria - £12m for both? We've been linked with Obiang heavily. Seems like a good player and is only 22, hope it happens, we need a young core. Eder has played out of his skin this season apparently, and has earned himself an Italy call up. Scored a beauty for them too and was the best player vs England. We need creativity and flair, pretty sure he has both. 

Mbodji from Genk - £5m. Provides cover in both midfield and defence and, again, has bags of energy. Not sure if he's good enough to start ahead of Kouyate, Noble and Obiang, but that competition is vital. Knowing our injury recorded he'll probably play most weeks due to injuries anyway! 

Ayew and Gignac from Marsielle - free. Say no more. Both great players who know how to score. Imagine Sakho up top with Gignac! Ayew ironically is the goalscoring winger Sam always wanted. Can also play in the middle or as a ST (I think that's where he plays for Ghana?) 

Total transfer fee cost: £23.5m. I imagine I've undervalued a few of these players though. Must take into account Ayew and Gignac's wages too, they'll be inflated as they came in on frees. 

Apparently we have nearer a £35m transfer budget though, so maybe we'll spend a bit of money on a few youngsters or we'll leave one of the players we've been linked with for a big name signing? 

Konoplyanka would've been nice, don't see how Stoke have attracted him when Liverpool and Spurs were kissing his feet 6 months back. Think he's out of reach now though. Don't think we realised how potentially detrimental the post-Christmas slump was to attracting marquee players. 

Also, Beauve sounds decent, a lot of goals from the wing. I'd have him if he was offered but he's the same kind of player as Ayew. I'd be happy with either, but it's one or the other for me. Not sure what Beauvue's asking price would be - £7m? For that reason, I'd rather Ayew.

null,false,domalino,1972crest,,null,"I was actually looking at his performance data on transfermarkt - Pellegrini played him as often as he could. Other than 4 games when he had that argument over the CL and was in the doghouse for a month, Pellegrini always made use of him if he wasn't injured. Every time he'd play a couple sub appearances and then a start or two, followed by him getting injured. 

I also don't think any Dzeko comparison is fair. Firstly Dzeko is a proper striker and Jovetic isn't, so there's a lot of situations when Dzeko is a better choice. And secondly, when faced with playing out of form Dzeko or out of form Jovetic is always go with Dzeko because he's actually shown that if he gets into form he'd be really useful. Jovetic on the other hand is very prone to huffing and puffing, doing flicks and tricks with loads of promise and very little substance. 

He's had 2 really good games in his city career, Bayern and Liverpool, and I'm incredibly disappointed because he came with so much promise.

He dutifully decided to apply his skills to help the local economy so set about pulling public financial records to see where savings could be made or where there was potential for future growth and potential.  As he explained it to me on a Summer's afternoon in 2013, in my back garden around a barbecue, that he already knew around 50% of the local economy would come under the public sector and that he'd already decided to ignore tourism as something to develop (although we're not talking about an British  tourist nexus or ex-pat 'Blackpool' like we here about in Spain where expat communities can be almost gated).  He then told me how he was shocked and alarmed to find the true figures.  His research had found that of the 50% which was private sector, around 70% of that was tied to the expat population which was predominantly British (with a significant but much smaller Dutch minority).

My reaction to that was ""Yeah, I think you might have got your figures wrong.""  And his reaction was that was what he'd thought, but then he added one word, 

""Housing.""

In using France as an example, the one thing they have  that the UK doesn't have is land.  Outside the metropolitan areas it doesn't sell at a premium.  They also have tax breaks on newbuilds and first time buyers, so the domestic buyer are throwing up very cheap, simple and affordable ICF homes.  

In comparison the UK is 'exporting' people looking for mid to upper range housing.  They're buying renovation projects.  We actually paying a premium for old rope, only we call it 'character'.  They're selling inflated UK homes, bringing over a stronger currency, and then employing local tradesmen.   We're out spending them in their own property markets in rural areas.  We're typically sending out middle class and retirees, they're not economising, and they're cash buyers.

The French chap concluded by saying he didn't like the idea of it, being dependent on an outside source, but any economic solution or plan he could see going forward had to include the British revenue stream as a key factor.

It's not just a one off either.

Alternatively you could have an income unit and ask the provider to reinvest income automatically. This would mean more units are automatically bought on the ex-dividend date.

&gt;__Constance Mary Whitehouse__, [CBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire) (née Hutcheson, 13 June 1910 – 23 November 2001) was an English social activist known for her strong opposition to [social liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism) and the mainstream British media, both of which she accused of encouraging a more [permissive society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_society). She was the founder and first president of the [National Viewers' and Listeners' Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawatch-uk), through which she led a longstanding campaign against the [British Broadcasting Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Broadcasting_Corporation) (BBC). A staunch [social conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservative), she was disparagingly termed a [reactionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary) by her socially liberal opponents. Her motivation derived from her traditional [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) beliefs, her aversion to the rapid social and political changes in British society of the 1960s and her work as a teacher of sex education.

I actually prefer spread based on olive oil, and I don't even like cheese. I've always been vegetarian, and the very few times I have eaten meat it was an unpleasant experience. From where you're standing now, meat is tasty. You could, if you so chose, re-train your body into finding another diet more pleasurable. I'm not saying you *should*. Just that it's possible, as this is what I and many other vegans have found.

Ah. I've always been an incredibly non-fussy eater. I'll eat kind of taste and texture, and generally enjoy it. I think I just like being full, more than the taste itself. So that's never been a big thing for me. I also control my diet quite strictly for health reasons, so I'm more an eat-to-live type, not live-to-eat. I too, reject the life is too short argument. I like to be morally consistent, and I'm fairly anal about consistency, which has lead me to where I am. I felt extremely guilty about milk, rather than less guilty about veal. That was the crux of my transition to veganism.

I think fundamentally, we agree on things. I certainly agree with a lot of what you're saying. I guess being vegan wasn't that hard for me and it seemed like the path of least resistance in my own mind. I think it would have been harder if I was brought up eating meat and my comfort foods were based around them as I had a lot less retraining my palate to do. It would've been harder still if I had dependents, or a SO who wasn't supportive (my SO is vegetarian but eats what I cook, and cooks stuff that I can eat). I feel like I'm quite tolerant though, at least, I *want* to be tolerant. I can understand that not everybody is in such a easy-to-be-vegan position as I am. I totally get what you're saying, and I can get behind it. 

I'm absolutely not trying to call you out here, but that last line doesn't sit well with me. You shouldn't have to disconnect from what you're eating. You're an intelligent person, you know what you are eating and you've just given me good reasons for being okay with it. If you then have to disguise it by cooking it (regardless of taste), then you can't be truly okay with it, deep down. I mean, it doesn't invalidate anything you've said, it just feels funny to me that you still feel like that about your food after having all of the information.

He walks around with a massively undeserved ego and massively undeserved success; actually, that's not quite right. He earned his success by being the editor of a viciously hateful, celebrity-obsessed and privacy-despising hypocritical tabloid. He built on that success because his willingness to dive lower than fecal matter of a dead angler fish rotting within the darkness of a deep sea fissure meant he was strangely able to climb over anyone with a hint of self-respect or honor. He then got a job on a music show thanks to his friend and fellow smug cunt Simon Cowell. They blew into each other's dicks enough to inflate their already massive egos and Piers made his living by being a professional cunt. That is, in all seriousness, what his job on American Idol was. He destroyed dreams with a smug smirk and found that he was finally being paid to be a bully. Now he has his own talk show, not because of his talent (which is confined solely to bathing Cowell and Murdoch's arseholes with the villainous slab of excess devil flab he calls a tongue) but because nobody in America KNOWS WHAT HE REALLY IS.

1. Speed
2. Stability
3. Separation
4. Smoothness (or Finesse, if I wasn't going for alliteration)

Firstly, speed. I didn't time it, but I'd wager that you were speeding more often than not in the video. Not only that, but I'd be travelling a little slower with all those parked cars about. Children/animals/adults could jump out, doors could open, etc. etc. Just take it easy; this is the worst point in your riding career to even consider speeding.

Your slow speed stability is an issue, in that you should simply stop, rather than wobble about the road. Practice your slow speed stuff in a car park until you're good at it.

When following a vehicle on the road, always leave **at least** a two second gap. A good phrase to remember is, ""Only a fool breaks the two second rule."" That takes about two seconds to say out loud. Pick a reference point on or by the road (cat's eye, line, tree) and start saying the phrase when the rear of the vehicle in front passes it. If the very front of your wheel passes the reference point before you finish saying the phrase, widen the gap and try again.

Finesse is a very important part of controlling any sort of machine. Accelerate smoothly and brake smoothly. Remember that smooth doesn't equal being slow. Yamming the throttle wide open after turning into a road before you're settled just gives you more instability and less time to correct it. Likewise, jamming on the brakes could lead to an intimate meeting with Mr Tarmac and Mrs Kerb.

Finally, ignore Ben Mcghie from the YouTube comments. He sounds somewhat foolish to me. Any split second advantage isn't worth risking the control issues from trying to do two things at once with the same hand. You can more than make up for that by ensuring your Speed is safe, your Separation is more than adequate and that you're riding Smoothly and not rushing.

With all that said, along with the rest of the thread, enjoy your riding and look after your bike!",null,0,null,1433529813,null,0,false,0,crwqh8a,null,t3_38mzg9,null,t1_crwqh8a,null,t3_38mzg9,null,null,null,1436757356,null,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

Mateo Kovacic has made an agreement with Liveprool, but 21 million euros aren't enough for inter.

Even though he isn't talking about it, Mateo Kovacic (21) played his last game in an inter kit. Everything came together perfectly for him: manager Roberto Mancini already for some time has been looking for other solutions to fix his midfield problems, and at the same time Liverpool showed interest for Mateo.

Mateo Kovacic came to an agreement with Liverpool, now it is left that the two clubs make a deal, but the finalization of that deal isn't very close at this moment. The offer that the Reds sent yesterday rose to 21 million euros, according to italian sources, which for inter is not enough.

The Italians aren't hurrying anywhere with Mateo's sale, because they know that Rogders is going to raise the offer, because he marked Kovacic as Steven Gerrard's successor. Inter's logic cannot be more clear: if the Reds are willing to pay for Lovren more than 25 million euros, why would such a midfielder as Mateo cost less?

Sorry that wasnt clear at all. £2 billion in lost tax revenue from cash-in-hand jobs pa. The £6 billion was tax due on a particular incident but a better figure to compare it would be how much HMRC claims they've lost through both tax avoidance and evasion, ~£119 billion pa (13/14 estimate). Back of the envolope calculation indicates that we should be getting ~£620 billion in tax pa, but only recieve ~£500 billion pa.

My point is that cash in hand jobs are problem, but they are a minor one compared to tax avoidance and evasion on the whole. As were being pragmatic Id rather worry about the clear majority of tax lost due to avoidance and evasion by wealthy individuals and the larger public companies.

&gt; The tax system needs to be changed so that the UK is still an attractive country to do business in.

My argument is less about whether **it's** competitive to do business and more about where you record your profits. They don't have to be in the same country, and this is increasingly the case. If the only tax we can levy against companies is VAT because they shift their profits to Hong Kong how can we be competitive? There is no way we can compete with small tax havens.

I totally agree that as it stands if UK tries to deal with this on **its** own there is a point where it would become counter productive to raise taxes. Id be very interested in seeing something more solid than my own speculation where that might be. I often see this claim used to argue for lower taxes or against higher taxes, but it is always assumed were already at or beyond this threshold.

But id like to see co-operation between nations (even sanctions on tax havens) to curb this tax dodging and being forced to set ever lower tax rates because of competition between nations.",null,0,null,1433530648,null,0,false,0,crwr10p,null,t3_38jv5k,null,t1_crwr10p,null,t1_crwoda7,null,null,null,1437570446,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If Rose overlaps, we may end up overloading the fullback and getting a good cross in, but we're also leaving his flank exposed for a potential counter. Then maybe Bentaleb can cover his area, but that would concede more space in the midfield. The team has to judge what they're comfortable with, where (and who) the players on the other team are, how much they need to score versus not concede, etc.

And often the wingers come all the way back to defend, but alternatively the Chadli in the diagram could be Bentaleb, with Chadli staying upfield in anticipation of a counter. Of course, that leaves us with fewer defending options in the midfield, but again it also gives us more offensive pressure. Upsides and downsides.

I gave you several suggestions in my first post.

&gt; would I be able to request the local council to move the trees then instead of removing them, as long it stops them from playing football?

You could ask them to do that but they will most likely decline. I doubt that the council will pay for the felling/moving of two rather large trees because of one single complaint.

Again, focus on the real problem here.

It won't. Ever. 

Because ""austerity"" is not a set of emergency measures to tackle a crisis. It's core tory policy and always has been. Widespread privatisation, even when it's at a massive loss. Huge cuts to welfare even when they hit the most vulnerable. Business policies which benefit banking and not much else. More wealth for the wealthy, none for the poor and a wealth gap that just keeps growing. 

Everything in that package has always been tory policy; none of it is new. The extraordinary success of this government has been to convince the country that not only are their core policies totally necessary, the other parties should adopt them too. 

If anyone doesn't believe me, simply lady the conditions which when met will trigger the end of austerity. You can't. Because they're not there.

Next thing I remember I wake up undergoing an EEG. Turns out I had been having major tonic-clonic seizures in my sleep. I'm not an epileptic and had never had a seizure before (I'm almost 24). The doctors thought I had them for three straight nights, and the last one was the worst. I bit a hole completely through my tongue, and couldn't even drink things for a day. I don't remember much from my two days in the hospital, but I do remember the bad news the doctor gave me before my discharge.

No driving for a month. I was working as an EMT, so this meant no work for a month either. No hockey, no working out, no physical exertion of any kind really, needed to take medications that I wasn't really doing well with, the works. I was in and out of it for the next three days, but couldn't sleep due to the medication, and it was really effecting me. Finally got prescribed a sleeping pill about a week later so that helped a bit.

Not working for a week was enjoyable, but in the week and a half since it's been boring. I was looking for a job in biological research as it was, so my job searching has increased, but things haven't broken right yet. I did move in with my longtime girlfriend this week to be in Boston where I would like to work, but she's away on business and I'm just chilling with the cat. My best friends are up in NH so it's not far but they're working and going away with this weekend (and most of my college friends have left Boston) so I don't have anyone to watch game 2 of the SCF with.

At some stage?  Many are quite insistent about this having already happened.  It's one of the very few places in the UK where grown adults are expected to share like students and fork out more to rent a room than you'd pay for a 2bed flat just an hour from London.

House shares are one thing.  In some low paid jobs, *room* shares are a thing.

&gt; Indigenous residents are comprehensively priced out of the housing market. For many these days, central London is like a foreign country, almost literally, given the rise in tourists and inhabitants from overseas.

Yup.  I know *young* Londoners (mid-20s, early 30s) who can remember when things were different and many are fed up of the place now.  London has changed immeasurably even since 2010 let alone the 1970s.

One commenter pointed out:

&gt;There is a feeling in London and the surrounding areas that the situation will implode on itself. London affects its surrounding area like a set of dominoes falling, or some kind of clinical swelling.

&gt;I am wondering how employers will be able to find suitable staff if commuting costs and conditions aren't improved, or housing isn't addressed. The congestion on the roads has significantly increased in the last few years in this formerly quiet area.

&gt;It is placing pressure on the counties surrounding it, especially as the population of London are leaving like rats leaving a sinking ship.

&gt;Everyone exhausted and crammed into tiny carriages, fiddling over their last pennies.

&gt;All this hassle and pressure, and hardly any money left after bills. It's a race to the bottom. Apart from those at the top. People are being pushed too far.

This matches up quite closely with what a lot of London young professionals I know (and I know loads) have been saying.  I'm seeing the cost of living is starting to bite harder than I'd thought and the ""Yay London!"" mentality is definitely fading (in some cases) to be replaced by one of ""I can't be arsed with this anymore, I'm too old to be living like a student paying £750 for a room that's near bars I've got sick of"".

It seems just unsustainable to me.  London will soon become for the super rich and those directly serving them, middle class professionals on decent five figure (or even low six figure) salaries are totally screwed - particularly if they want to do normal things like buy a house or have a family.",null,0,null,1433534913,null,0,1433535249,0,crwttsj,null,t3_38pc78,null,t1_crwttsj,null,t3_38pc78,null,null,null,1436759575,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The answer, unsurprisingly is Yes and No.

To give a top down backlog, there are a few stories running concurrent to each other, that have intertwined to create the present cluster fuck.

1) Was Al Qaida in Iraq prior to the Iraq war... the conventional wisdom is No... I believed this. Apparently, and actually with hindsight it makes sense that the answer is Yes.

We need to look back to the Iran/Iraq war, and also look to the first Gulf war, when the there was a popular uprising against Saddam, unsupported by the West, that resulted in the gassing of the Kurds.

Iran) This created a perma frost on Iranian and Iraqi relations, obviously. Saddam was in many respects a classically Arabian marxist/socialist (Baathist). Despite the many ironic overlaps between islamism and the hard left, there were uncompromisable differences, namely the rejection of man made law et al... All the jazz we are seeing now. 

So we had the Iran Iraq war in 88, then the Afghan Soviet war in 89 where swathes of battle hardened men went off to form the mujahedin (and become further radicalised), and then the gulf war (and subsequent failed uprising).   

Taking the view that in a region becoming increasingly fundamentalist, Saddam stood out as a baathist marxist, and for the Iranians, and also the Kurds, their enemies enemy became their friend. 

Al Qaida in Iraq (AQI) later to become Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) were in operation in the Kurdish regions of Iraq, and able to hop the border to seek shelter in Iran if Saddam's troops started pressing. Note, despite the plight of the Kurds against Isis, it is rarely reported how many Kurds actually fight with ISIS - actually a lot.

Now.... Now this is where things started to get fucked up.

So Saddam knew that this cat and mouse game was going on between Iran, the Kurds, and the radical Islamists... He knew that due to the Shia population in southern Iraq, he had a real risk of militias rising up from within.... He also felt that after the first Gulf war that the west would never **actually** invade.

So knowing his biggest threat came from guerilla warfare, he changed his militaries focus and they all retrained for counter insurgency.

Secondly, noticing the trend of islamism in the region - and within Iraq, he decided to try and infiltrate it for his advantage. He sent his officers en masse into the mosques with the aim of instilling a baathist ethic into iraqi islamism... 

What actually happened was the opposite. His officer class became radicalised...

So what do we have here.... 

Al Qaida in Iraq, supported by the Kurds and the Iranians....
An Iraqi army, trained in counter insurgency....
An officer class, radicalised and spreading islamism through the Iraqi army....

Then the US led invasion takes place, and what is the first thing they do - disband the army, but let them keep all their arms and munition...

So 30,000 highly trained, religiously radicalised, seriously armed and unemployed soldiers went and had a chat with Mr Zarqawi, the firebrand leader of AQ in Iraq... 

the rest, they say is history.

The thing about Eccleston is he did my favorite season with my favorite Doctor and I thought almost every episode was brilliant. He did my favorite story as well, *Empty Child/Doctor Dances*. His performance was always spot-on and he was *just* cynical enough that I loved him at twelve when I was really cynical, but still love him at twenty-one now that I'm not. In a lot of ways, he's *the Doctor* to me, and everyone else is ""the x^th Doctor"", much as I love them.

But there's just so *little* of him. There were only ten TV stories. I have all of Nine's comics from *Doctor Who Magazine*; there were few enough that they can fit into one collection. I understand that there are quite a few prose stories from either the magazine or novels that I don't have. But while I do want to get all the prose stories, I understand that there are only thirteen of them, and that some of them might be quite hard to find. In addition, aside from a couple multi-Doctor stories he appears in for 10 and 11, I have every comic he's been in except the ongoing Titan series. Basically, I feel like I've exhausted the reserves of Ninth Doctor stories.

null,false,Doomchicken7,num3,,null,"Tom Glover is an U18 goalkeeper, which is fitting for a man named 'Glover'. He's an Australian and a good goalkeeper, despite having played striker until he was twelve. Unfortunately he's a Chelsea fan...

Jordan Archer spent the season on loan to Millwall's bench as they were relegated from the Championship. He hasn't improved much in the past few years, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he were sold. 

Luke McGee is first choice goalkeeper for the U21s. He's a bit like Lloris (although obviously not as good) with his shot stopping abilities. I think a great save of his was posted on here a while ago, although I might be imagining things.

Kyle Walker-Peters has been described as a cross between Kyle Walker and Martin Peters (England RB in 1966). He's fast, a very good dribbler, and a good defender. He can also play left back, as seen in the recent friendlies. 

Ryan Fredericks is a rapid right back, because Walker, Yedlin, and KWP aren't enough to fill that need. When he was not injured, he was the starting right back for Middlesborough, who had one of the best defences in the Championship. 

Cameron Carter-Vickers has been called the next Ledley King. It's not hard to see why. He's got great positioning, he's good in the air, he's quick and he's a natural leader. He's only 17, but is a regular for the US U20s.

Everyone thought Dominic Ball was a centre back, but when he went on loan to Cambridge (League 2) he had a nightmare in his favoured position. At right back, he looked a lot better. He can also play in the midfield if he has to. He's not as promising as CCV or Veljkovic, but still has decent potential.

Milos Veljkovic can play either CB or CDM. He's a good defender, however he's not very tall. He's good on the ball and can pass very well, so he may end up in midfield. You may remember him from the end of last season, when he played ~35 minutes.

Harry Winks is the core of the youth team's midfield. He's a good passer, and he can dictate the play when given the chance. You've probably seen him play in the recent friendly against Malaysia. He's not quite first team ready, but could get a lot of time in Europe.

Joshua Onomah is one of the top players in our youth team. He's been described as a mini-Pogba because he's gangly, but strong and has good technique. Some say he's playing better for the youth team than Bentaleb was.

Marcus Edwards has caught the eye of Barcelona playing as an attacking mid, which must have been difficult due to his small size. He's an exceptionally skilled player, who has a good tactical mind to back up his skills.

Everyone here has heard of Alex Pritchard. He's plays anywhere across an attacking three, although he prefers the centre or left. He's not fast or strong, but he is technically skilled and creative. He's a free kick specialist. He spent the season on loan at Brentford (5th in Championship), where he was a star player.

Ismail Azzaoui is one of the club's many Belgian players. He plays on the wing most of the time, although he's also been used as a number 10 once or twice. 

Nathan Oduwa can play either on the left wing or up front. He's a fast, tricky player with good technical skill and an eye for goal. He went on loan to Luton (League 2), but wasn't given much play time. When he did play, he looked very good.

Emmanuel Sonupe plays on the right wing, although his loan at St Mirrem (Scots Prem) didn't lead to much play time. He's a fast, direct winger - kind of like Lennon, although not as good as Lennon was at his age.

Kenny McEvoy looks just like Bale, both in appearance and the way he sprints down the wings. He's got a good cross and can put in the occasional goal. However, he doesn't have any skills or tricks to beat a man. He struggled to make the side at Colchester (League 1), but did enough for the U21s to earn a new contract. 

Shayon Harrison is a striker who *hates* Chelsea. This season, he's scored 10 goals against them. He also scored 4 against Arsenal in one match. He's among the top youth league scorers, despite sharing playtime with...

Ryan Loft. I've never seen him play, but from what I've heard he's a decent striker. He doesn't get as much playtime as Harrison - it's probably about a 65/35 split.

Shaquile Coulthirst is a left winger or striker, depending on the day of the week. He's fairly fast, and a decent enough goalscorer. He finished the season on loan at York City (League 2), where he scored two goals in eleven. Not the most promising.

Jack Roles is a bit younger than all the others, and mostly played for the U16s this season. He's quite a few years from the first team. He can play and score from everywhere, pretty much. He scored a hattrick from CDM not too long ago.",null,0,null,1433536866,null,0,false,0,crwv3lg,null,t3_38oitm,null,t1_crwv3lg,null,t3_38oitm,null,null,null,1436760650,null,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12,null

Lennon-----Bale-----Hazard

We proceed to finish 4th once again. Bale decides to give it another year before leaving. We buy Eriksen with the funds from selling Huddlestone and Livermore. 

Bale-----Eriksen-----Hazard

-----------Defoe------------

This powerful attack shoots us into 3rd place. With the money from three years of Champions League football, we raise Bale's wages until he agrees to stay. We clear out dead weight and make some purchases. By the end of 2014/15, we line up with:

----------------Lloris------------

Walker---Dier------Vert---Rose

----Schneiderlin---Bentaleb----

Bale---------Eriksen-----Hazard

----------------Kane-------------

We win the league.

Left wingers who aren't careful end up defending weak positions weakly and conceding unnecessary ground all the time; the big lies on the right go barely challenged, whilst the tiniest of misstatements on the left are circulated endlessly on 24 hour news cycles.  Left wing issues are spoken about in a different language than right wing issues, with different assumptions and expectations, that is, where they are spoken of at all.  All of this is strongly supported by empirical evidence, for example, that [wealthy elites and business interests largely determine the political agenda and policy decision-making, mass movements like unions and community groups have almost zero influence](http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf).",null,0,null,1433538100,null,0,false,0,crwvvm9,null,t3_38ilz1,null,t1_crwvvm9,null,t1_crwfpr5,null,null,null,1436761164,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I should divulge I'm a secondary teacher. I'm just taking from experience of what helps to get 82% C and above. 

To be fair, we're adapting teaching now in light of the changes to GCSE that will occur in 2017. Verbal reasoning, as in, being able to figure out the maths hidden within the words is going to be a massive part of the paper. Ultimately, there is this idea at the moment that giving a kid the best possible chance of a C in maths is the best thing you can do, so that whatever they choose to do in the future they have that fundamental basis. The new GCSE won't make that so easy as it is now, so we'll adapt, but generally you do what's best for the child. If the kid is predicted an A and they want to do A-Level then naturally you push them, give them the tools you correctly raised and they'll go on to do it at A-Level and learn even more. If you have a kid who just can't get it, but say is fantastic at English, you drill them, get them their C so they don't have to worry about doing it when they're 24 and let them go on to excel at whatever they're talented at.

He asks them and they deliver. You now won't get that job due to a stupid post you thought no one could see but you forgot about and thought it wouldn't be a big deal.

You may have ""Nothing to hide"". But there is always something in everyone's lives that will ruin it if spread around. The government at the moment has the ability to know everything about you. That embarrassing photo from 14 years ago, That blow job you gave to that guy which then gloated in a PM years ago. The government knows that. Only you have forgotten about the past. They haven't.

What if you get a letter through one day. You have been disputing a parking ticket. The government says. Pay up or we will tell Jullie down the street that you fancy her husband and had a one night stand with them?

Then David Cameron comes out and states ""The british people need to accept that just because you abide by the law, doesn't mean you aren't gulity"" or whatever it was that he said. I believe it's on the front page at the moment.

I bought one of those £5 international calling cards (the one branded ""TalkHome"") to call a friend who was abroad and needed some help.

Weeks later, some people started to ask me ""what's that nonsense"" with my voicemail. Turns out that every time that I didn't answer my mobile as soon as it rang the first couple of times, the call was then diverted to the public phone booth which I had called my friend in Argentina, so it wasn't actually my voicemail as I was told. And the people near that phone booth somewhere in Argentina would answer the phone and tell the caller to wait a minute while they would ask around if there was anyone ~~where~~ there named X (my name) but they would never come back to phone. Eventually the caller would hang up. 
A friend actually asked me if I had hired a Spanish speaking secretary to answer my mobile - what a knob! lol

Never managed to figure out the root cause and after about a year it stopped. At some point I thought it could be one of those scams that transfer the caller to a premium foreign number (£10 per minute) but it wasn't.

Food bank usage is increasing, but to say it's because of X is misleading.  Job centres now direct those who need it to food banks while previously they were not allowed.  


Of course other people matter, but I didn't come from a privilege background, nor one based on money.  I learnt from a early age things won't be handed to you on a platter and went out and worked hard.  There should be a bare minimum to those who can work, but don't want to, it should be so painful to exist on that minimum that they're forced into work to enjoy life.  

To clear up some things,  I have absolutely no issue giving benefits to those physically or mentally unable to work and all efforts to accommodate their requirements should be made by the state. 

As far as bankers bonuses go, the banks are (and should) be private entities run for the interest of shareholders, and if shareholders are happy paying those levels of bonuses it shouldn't be an issue.

In general, I oppose privatisation and think that the public sector should probably be expanding in terms of products offered and size of existing operations.

But there has to be some kind of rationale for what sectors are appropriate for what level of public control (light regulation, state investment/subsidy, heavy regulation, state-owned enterprise, public enterprise, core civil service).

Perhaps for Royal Mail, the argument is that its role as provider of the natural monopoly on communications has been superseded and that it no longer plays an essential role in public life, and therefore doesn't need to be publicly controlled.

A greater enthusiast in the free market might conclude that if the intervention is no longer necessary, the enterprise should be made private to reduce market distortion.

null,false,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,null,"&gt; The same bank gave my mum a 150k mortgage on a 20k salary which is why I thought there might be a possibility.

Are you sure and if so, did this happen recently? Are you saying that your mother has bought a property using a mortgage, where the property has a £150,000 outstanding mortgage (eg: she paid £50,000 deposit on a £200,000 property) and she has a total of £20,000 per year income? The mortgage payment on that sort of mortgage would be at least 50% of her take home pay.

Mortgage rules changed in the last few years, 15 years ago you could get a 110% mortgage with minimal evidence of the ability to repay, nowadays with MMR ([Mortgage Market Review](http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/firm-types/mortgage-brokers-and-home-finance-lenders/mortgage-market-review)) lenders are required to carefully assess affordability and you would be lucky to get a £100,000 mortgage on a £20,000 salary, let alone a £150,000 mortgage. I would be very very surprised if your mother got her mortgage in the last few years, and if she did: what bank are you both with? 

What lenders care about is affordability. To explain it in simple terms: they take your take home income and then after accounting for fixed payments (child care costs, outstanding debts) they work out if you could afford the mortgage at higher interest rates. Someone who needs to spend over 50% of their take home income on *current* interest rates would never handle rates of 6, 7, 8%... and they would fail affordability. There are lots of mortgage affordability calculators online from various lenders, [try this one from Halifax to see how much you can borrow](http://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/tools_and_calculators/mortgage_affordability_calculator/default.aspx).

When you drink heavily for years you damage your liver irreparably. It shrinks and makes passage of venous blood through it difficult.  The liver filters all the blood that's coming back from your gut, so the fact that this blood struggles to get through the liver results in a back pressure. This in turn causes some veins to swell up under quite a bit of pressure. 

One such group is at the bottom of the gullet and when this happens they are called Oesophageal Varices (a varix is a dilated vein - like varicose veins in the leg). These varices are fragile and prone to bleeding and when they do, they do so at fairly high pressure - meaning you lose a lot of blood quickly. It's often pretty sudden and quick. 

There are other possibilities, like less acute bleeding from stomach ulcers or other kinds of haemorrhage (the liver produces all sorts of thing that let your blood clot, so if it doesn't work well you can bleed considerably from anywhere), but a variceal bleed would be the most sudden, acute and unexpected.",null,0,null,1433548497,null,0,1433548721,0,crx1os7,null,t3_38nxir,null,t1_crx1os7,null,t1_crwoaq4,null,null,null,1436765385,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,for_shaaame,null,null,null,"Honestly, I don't really know - the article is vague on the details.  It seems to imply that the girl was awarded £20,000 solely because she was arrested for something she didn't do.  There's no suggestion that the arrest was illegal or conducted in an inhuman or degrading way, or that she was treated any differently to anyone else who was arrested.

Why this girl in particular was awarded compensation when people are frequently arrested for something which it later turns out they obviously didn't do, I don't know.  It probably has something to do with the fact that this girl was raped and the police contributed to her trauma by arresting her.

But the vast majority of rape reports are taken extremely seriously immediately.  In a culture of covering your own back, there must have been a very good reason to doubt this girl - a reason which is not provided in the article.

&gt;they would have been well within their rights to disbelieve her, not investigate any of her complaints, arrest her for the crime they believed she committed (lying), and crucially to not test the forensic evidence on her t-shirt?

You're asking a question which makes no sense in terms of how things actually work.

Policing is statistics-driven.  When a crime is reported, it gets recorded by the police force for the area where it happened.  When an offender is identified and dealt with (i.e. charged, cautioned, etc.) then the crime report becomes ""detected"".

Lots of undetected crimes look bad, so police bosses try to get as many crimes detected as possible.  Lots of undetected serious sexual offences look really *really* bad, so the police try really really hard to detect them.

The crime recording rules, however, state that the police can ""un-record"" a crime if they have evidence that, on the balance of probability, a crime did not occur - e.g. the victim lied about the offence.  They must have some evidence which enables them to say with greater than 50% certainty (which is what ""on the balance of probabilities"" means) that the crime did not occur.  So in this case, the police must have had a compelling reason to un-record the rape report.

The Home Office scrutinise crime recording practices, especially ""no-crimes"" where a crime has been un-recorded, to stop dodgy practices.  This means that forces don't un-record a crime without good reason for fear of getting sanctioned by the Home Office.

So yes, if the police can say with greater than 50% certainty that a crime did not occur, they are well within their rights to disbelieve it.",null,0,null,1433549820,null,0,false,0,crx2cdn,null,t3_38ker6,null,t1_crx2cdn,null,t1_crwctxe,null,null,null,1436765914,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

Are you referring to the accident on the Runnaway Mine Train that wasn't even slightly similar to this?

RMT operates a single train along a powered track. I agree there that there was a maintainance issue, as the train separated mid course. The ride was then e-stopped and one half rolled back into the other causing a crash.

Smiler is a roller coaster that is not powered throughout it's circuit, and is propelled under it's own momentum under gravity. It operates 4 trains in block sections controlled by several computers. A train stalled - a rare occurrence in itself, usually due to a combination of a very light train (in this case empty!), high winds or cold or sometimes even something stuck in a wheel (such as a piece of clothing, a bird...) - and a train somehow entered the same block and hit it.

Accidents happen everywhere - Smiler's accident is scary because it should be impossible and they need to figure out why it wasn't. It looks like a multi-layered coincidental accident to me.

Very much doubt Lovren was brought in for £20m to play on a side of the defence he had never played before.

If Skrtel believes he's the best, or even just worth a place in the starting 11, here is his chance to prove it. I imagine it's structured so that he'll make more money if he does play often. If he really does love playing for the club he'll appreciate that we're trying to push this wage structure so we stop getting burnt by big shitty contracts.

My view is that the fullback would normally be free to either overlap or pull inwards or sit five yards back as support - BUT where Spurs have struggled is that the fullback's decision has to be balanced by a central (if not outright defensive) midfielder. We've played with most of the season with Bentaleb and Mason, neither are defensively the shield we need - although both can be a pressuring midfielder, if you get the difference. 
2) the wall: our man is there for two-there  reasons: 
A) make it harder for he wall to move around (not just he jump, but also left/right) like the goalie would want it

No. If it's a physical threat, yes, but this isn't. The police can't monitor shades of insults, and if they did, I feel, sadly, that they would get more wrong than they do right.

What's the solution? Well, after a pub visit, here's my best effort. An Internet Offence Panel. The IOP (easy to type too), would award points to the victims from 1 to 10. A one gives you the the address and name of the offender, and the right to throw a custard pie in their face. A 10 gives you the right to do what ever you like to the offender that isn't death.

I think the important thing is whether it's happening multiple times from the same person/people in which case it's probably considered harassment anyway. 

I believe in free speech which means universal free speech even for things I detest, that doesn't mean I think anyone deserves this or should have to go through this, they shouldn't, but I still don't think the police should be getting involved. Where do we draw the line with this? The police being called in because someone insulted you in a pub?

You can report people on twitter and ban them, and like I say if they keep doing it by making new accounts or whatever then it could be considered harassment and the police would get involved. 


The fact is people are always going to say horrible shit, and at some point you're going to have to hear some cunt say something horrible, we can't punish everyone who offends, and that's the road you go down when you start prosecuting (which we have). Beside, you won't stop internet trolling even with arrests, the public ostracising people who act like cunts is the best way to deal with them.

This is obviously a severe case and in this instance I'm not saying it can easily be ignored, but we are turning into a nation in a constant state of 'being offended', the 'sticks and stones' rhyme obviously isn't working, the fact is words don't give offence, you take offence to them. The quote at the end says ""There is a responsibility on police and internet providers to protect people online."" but the reality is there's nothing to protect you from, you're not in danger, we can't have the police protecting people from being offended or they are essentially baby sitters. 

The way people got so offended by a distasteful joke about the glasgow bin crash to the point where the police are pressured into making an arrest is one of the most shocking examples of this.

Basically the chance of picking two blue counters consecutively is: 7/x * 6/x-1. This is because when Jill takes the counter there is already one less blue counter and one less counter overall.

Now 7*6=42 obviously. And, by manipulating the fractions we can ascertain that 42 = 0.2x(x-1)

By multiplying the equation by 5 we get 210 = x(x-1) and therefore
210 = x²-x

If this is the case then x²-x-210  must be equal to 0. 

It's also very easy from here to work out the value of x which must be either -14 or 15 and considering we're discussing physical counters the answer must be 15.
