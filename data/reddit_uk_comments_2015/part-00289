In this situation there is a vast difference in policy between Corbyn and the other candidates. I can say with 100% certainty that I'd be voting for female Corbyn if male Corbyn were somehow to be replaced.

To go further, as I said Cooper is my second choice. I would vote for her over Burnham had Corbyn never been part of this election. Her policies again better align with mine when compared to Kendal's. Regarding Burnham I don't know what he represents, he is far too reactionary for my liking.

Going back to my subconscious biases for a moment, I obviously have biases as everyone does. That's the way the human mind works. I would argue however that not all people have the same background a develop completely different biases. In terms of women being in positions of Authority, I've never felt that men were naturally better suited. In much the same way I've never viewed women as naturally better carers or parents as many seem to suggest. These are things based on individual traits separate from gender.

Finally, I feel as though we need to discuss what I personally believe are the traits required for a PM or party leader. I have never held the belief that a PM must always be an authoritative leader. Of course there are times throughout history where that may be a beneficial trait, but it's certainly not a requirement. Of course being authoritative can pave the way for working your way into a position to be up for consideration, but that's beside the point.

In short, I'm not going to discredit what you have said flat out, but state plainly that I don't think that this applies to me personally.

You are putting an awful lot of effort into sidestepping the facts, but you are ignoring some glaring omissions in your data, such as the fact that your data does not differentiate between rape and sexual assault of adults and children. 

You actually have no evidence that whites abuse children disproportionately, you are just cherry picking data that sort of matches what you want to say, but you have no real evidence.

Hundal has made a seriously embarrassing misreading of the source he sites in his LabourList column which he believes supports these claims, which is the research [presented by Peter Kellner](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/labour-voters-election-europe-immigration) in Prospect.

Secondly, £5k isn't a lot these days.  It will help keep the wolf from the door, or start you on the road to a deposit - but it is unlikely to dramatically change your life.

I assume you haven't got any significant debts other than your student loans?  If you do, make paying them off your priority.

I'd suggest that you put £4,500 into an ISA.  Try to ignore it while you finish up your studies.  That will make a nice rainy day / emergency fund.  You can keep adding to it until it's needed - either for a home or something else.

But take £500 and do something fun that your gran would have wanted you to do.  Whether it's a holiday, buying a nice piece of art, a watch, or giving it to the stray cats home - find something which will give you meaning and would have made her happy.

Should we sign proven players like Marcelo (dream signing), Alberto Moreno, and Fabio Coentrao? Or wait it out and send youth players like Angelino to NYFC to develop?

 I'm personally ambivalent. Despite progressing out of the Champions League group stage and finishing second in the league, a trophyless season still feels like failure. But that's the way football is nowadays. Big clubs spend big money and with it comes unrealistic expectations for immediate and consistent results. The likes of Roberto Mancini and AVB can attest to this. 

Fans/Board/Community, including myself, have gotten too greedy. Knowing City's financial capabilities I expect them to solve issues like our vulnerable defense instantly. But maybe it is the wiser choice to be patient.

My constituency in the 2015 election is such a safe labour seat I was subjected to almost no campaigning, not even from labour.

The police don't want to make decisions like this, but unfortunately, they have too. Burglary is a tough case crime to investigate as it usually happens when people aren't home, if the offender isn't in the system then fingerprints and DNA is useless, CCTV can be used but if the offender is wearing a mask or hood. If it is a crime in progress (offender still in the property when 999 rang) they will respond as appropriate, probably grade 1 call meaning lights and sirens to the scene. If the offender committed the offence while you were on holiday or at work and is ni where near the area, then a PCSO or PC/SPC (depending on force policy and available resources) will be sent to take statements ect. Scenes of crimes officers will be sent to collect evidence, if there is any. Then CID may investigate but like I said earlier. It is a difficult crime to solve. With budget cuts come consequences and this is how it will be until budgets are reversed back to how they should be.

The textbook argument for ""attracting people"" is to offer a higher salary. That doesn't appear to work, as I've said. So what would you propose? £500k or £1m salaries for council leaders? Will that suddenly get competent people? Can we get the job done without some highly paid ""CEO"" and instead give it to a group of well but not obscenely paid people?

I wonder if these things actually get a lot of actually competent people applying already, but they get knocked out of the running in favour of some member of the old boys' network. Is there no one in the council at all that can't do the job? (most council CEOs seem to be ""headhunted"" from other councils or quangos)

Who is he considering average at centre half? OK, Kolo is a bit long in the tooth, but the man has won leagues, cups, African Nations, a string of top-class honours.

Lovren? 12 months ago he was considered by many to be one of the best centre-halves in the league, one bad season does not wipe that out.

To answer your question then - the increase in oil prices till , wasn't a huge driver of real wage decline (the crash and austerity were), but the 2014 decline in oil prices has been a huge driver of change in inflation because it's a similar sized change in price taking place over 3-6 months rather than 8 years.

null,false,lgf92,eng-northumberland,Land of the Sausage Roll,null,"This. The judgment lays out clearly that a) the mother had an obligation under existing probate legislation to maintain her dependents, b) that the mother had refused to reconcile with her daughter on grounds the court found spurious, c) a trial judge in 2007 had already ruled that an award of £69,200 was in order. 

More specifically, the appeal judge ruled that the original judge had failed to take into account a) the severity of the living conditions of the appellant, and b) the effect that such a cash award would have on the appellant's benefit receipts. It was also ruled that the needs of the appellant for provision exceeded the need of the charities which were named in the will. 

The appellant was living on a combined income of around £5,000 a year then about £13,000 in benefits, most of which would disappear after a large grant. Therefore the judge had to ensure that any grant of the money from the estate would adequately cover reasonable provision. Taking into account that the appellant hadn't been able to save or contribute to a pension future need had to be taken into account as well.

By granting the £143,000 to buy the house, it means that the appellant won't have to pay rent and won't lose benefits other than housing benefit either, meaning that their reasonable provision is maintained. The additional £20,000 on top is to allow for £331 per year in maintenance from the estate over 60 years - i.e. reasonable maintenance from an estate of that size. 

**tl;dr - Parents have an obligation to provide *some* maintenance to their adult dependents if the latter are living in sub-standard conditions. Giving a small grant alone (the £20,000, or the £69,200 proposed originally) would actually make them worse-off, so the grant of £143,000 for the house was the smallest amount of reasonable provision the court could allot.** It's not a case of 'judges making me give away my money'.

And it wouldn't spell annihilation for those parties just as it didn't when they voted against holding a referendum pre-2011 -- when support for a referendum was significantly higher than it is now.  It'd piss off committed Yes voters, but how many of them are left in unionist parties anyway?

If there's a Brexit in 2016 and Scotland votes to stay in, I'm 99% convinced that Cameron's response would be ""you just held a referendum 2 years ago which settled it for a generation.  The EU referendum was democratic and we must abide by the result.""  Would pro-independence folk in Scotland hate him for this?  Probably.  Would he care?  Probably not -- they already do.

This isn't a revolution.  There isn't a Scottish IRA.  There isn't going to be military on the streets.  He'll just say 'no', appeal to the half of the country that doesn't want independence, and that'll be that.

null,false,lazytoxer,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,null,"I was thinking more that, while the size of the public sector and GDP don't always correlate, a rapid rebalancing based around a shrinking of the public sector would have stunted growth if it wasn't carefully managed. Looking at the rest of the G7 and today's news, I think the gov has done pretty well.  

I think the problem with waiting for interest rates to sort themselves out was that the public mood would never be in a position where austerity was palatable until we suffered another crash, nor was there any guarantee that they would sort themselves out before another problem. Since the crash we've had the Euro crisis, Russia on the move and the rise of ISIS. We are not living in a world which is sufficiently predictable to gamble and to wait.

High growth is more important than getting the debt down, but it's the deficit that we need to worry about, particularly in the event  we need to borrow massive sums at high interest rates. Regulating the banks is important for dealing with the specific problem which caused this crisis, but regulation will never be enough to offset all the risks of a global financial system. Even if we diversify, business of all kinds relies on financial services and credit. A financial crisis will always have a potential to cause problems, particularly where a government is in a poor position to provide liquidity.

It is better to grow as quickly as possible while ensuring that our government finances are in a fit state were an emergency of any kind to occur, whether a credit crunch, a war, or an environmental disaster. There is a danger that we are merely going to fix yesterday's problems by looking at banking. If we are to be responsible we need to learn the broader lesson that we can't always predict where a problem is going to come from but that it is better not to leave oneself vulnerable by over-relying on borrowing.

In terms of course content (geography and environmental science) I found it much easier than Leicester; third year stuff was similar to first year stuff at Leicester, but this is reflected in the grade boundaries which are significantly higher at the OU than any other university I can think of. My tutors were all very helpful, and there are loads of resources and support teams for questions or problems.

I always found that my work was marked much more thoroughly at the OU than Leicester. One of my lecturers there literally just wrote one-word summaries on one essay, but everything I submitted at the OU came back with reams of comments and feedback.

I probably wouldn't do it again though. For a start the cost is silly now and totally disproportionate to the value of most courses. The amount of work is considerable and you need to be super motivated to get through it. And if you get bored with a module remember that it is much longer than most at a physical university, lasting about eight months.

I think such studies are often misleading because there are significant differences between women's and men's health conditions; unless questions are specifically tailored for women with 50% of participants being women, the results become less about the general population and more about men by default. You might even argue that once the differences in women's sexuality are considered, it is meaningless to try and draw patterns about the population generally and such studies should only be conducted on a single gender basis.

For example, erectile dysfunction is a side effect of heart disease medication. Since men are phallocentric, this could explain the lower instances of sex in men with heart conditions. However, what about women with coronary disease who don't have to be concerned with erectile dysfunction?

The whole ""someone invaded your home and you don't feel safe"" doesn't really factor in that black and white thinking. Burglary is seen in the same light as smashing a window or pickpocketing - something you wouldn't expect Plod to come out for either.

We were burgaled about four years ago and, to their credit, the police response was very good. We had PCSOs out initially to take statements and inventories, CSI followed, local officers knocked on neighbouring doors with security advice and we had a follow-up call.  However, this was at a time when West Yorks Police were getting a lot of heat about burglary in Leeds. 

About six months later we got a letter informing us that they had apprehended a young man. He was caught at another burglary and, when questioned, had admitted to 96 other offences, one of which was ours.

His punishment for this crime wave? Six months.

If you study with the OU you *have* to be incredibly motivated. It's difficult, especially if you're working. But the support from the tutors and other students is fantastic. Also be aware that tutorials will likely be held on Saturdays, and I couldn't attend mine in my final year due to working. But if you can go to the tutorials, go.

I was very lucky in that I had my entire OU degree funded, which I don't think is available any more. But despite the costs, I think it is a world class institution and would jump at the chance to study for another degree with them if someone gave me the money ;)",null,0,null,1438106054,null,0,1438106644,0,ctj8czi,null,t3_3ewblc,null,t1_ctj8czi,null,t3_3ewblc,null,null,null,1440138558,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Check your copy of the contract for details of late payment fees and update here please.

Stop phoning them immediately. Either email or send recorded delivery snail mail.  State in all letters that you will now only commicate with them in writing. Do not accept incoming calls from them. Keep copies of all communication from you and from them. This will stop them claiming harassing and you will have proof of their BS.

Ask for copies of the historic notifications of late fees that they previously sent you ( I'm assuming they didn't send any because they weren't going to charge you until this cheque fell in their laps). Request that they send these within 10 working days. If they admit there were none or they fail to respond, follow up with request for full refund of cheque within 10 workings days or you will pursue through small claims court. 

Did you pay a deposit? Did they refund it? Did they send you notification of the scheme which protected it within 30 days of you originally paying it?

Other than that I'd recommend going to a supermarket and picking up a few different styles e.g. stout, porter, *good* lagers, bitter, wheat beers etc. Morrison's and Mark's and Spencer seem to beat the others in terms of their range of styles if not necessarily as many or the best beers.

&gt;- in proportion to other effects, changes in thought, perception, and mood should predominate;

&gt; - intellectual or memory impairment should be minimal;

&gt;- stupor, narcosis, or excessive stimulation should not be an integral effect;

&gt;- autonomic nervous system side effects should be minimal;

It's a crude measure, but I don't expect we'll see any significant reduction in talent in the short term. It's part of trying to force open Westminster's culture - the place didn't even have daycare facilities until Bercow took over, of all things. 

The *cabinet* point is a peculiar one, though - there's certainly no shortage of talented women that could shoot for cabinet positions, but setting a hard target of 50% doesn't sound like it gives him much room for nuance.

yeah, the cheque came from the council and was made payable to the agents only which is why they offered to cash it for me - I thought they were doing me a favour but they probably planned it all along.
I don't believe so, we checked to see if they belong to any but seemingly they don't I'm going to double check again before my boyfriend asks them. 
The contract says £30 charged after 7 days of late payment and 3% interest, I have paid late fees before but when I rang up they said they should've charged me more but they didn't. 
I haven't phoned them for a while now, my mam did but she ended up putting the phone down. My boyfriend is going to write them a letter on my behalf, I'm not really able to do it myself, I'm no good at standing up to them. I don't think they have my number anyway, I changed it in May and I doubt they saved it as they have never called me back - they have my mams though, I will tell her to ignore them. 
I think that's right, never any official breakdown of fees or anything like that and they haven't said anything about fees recently either. 
I paid £360 for my deposit including £60 admin fees. I haven't had it back yet, 7 of us paid that each and there is £360 deducted for gardening and decorating fees - but it is being refunded to the lead tenant, but they have some sort of bill that comes to £700 first so I might get £100 or so from that eventually.

null,false,Colin-IRE,,Belfast,null,"&gt; But what annoys me the most is that I work full time and earn a living but the number of children i can afford is limited to 1. Yet these kids pump out kids without any regret or thought and simply get paid for doing so and never drag themseleves out of bed to get to work come home cook+clean and deal with kids and pay for child minding while at work.

What's the alternative, condem more children to poverty because of the  irresponsibility of their parents? 

I agree it's not ideal but it is not the root cause of the problem, also as someone that was raised by a single mother on benefits I can assure you it is a loooong way from being a comfortable living, any sort of full time wage is going to be better if they can get it.

No, if you want to tackle young benefit dependant parenting you do it at the source. I'm not going to pretend I have the answers... my view would say it all starts with a healthy view of sex and family planing in society as a whole; less stigmatisation of sexuality, more frank birth control education and availability and yes, people should be taught that life as a parent dependant on benefits isn't a happily ever after.

I think it would help people to be more informed, could you briefly answer a few questions for me if that's o.k.

1. Who do the fines go to?

2. Who pays for the police budget?

3. Are there targets for issuing tickets?

4. Who sets these targets? (Ignore if invalid.)

5.if the cost of processing tickets isn't covered by the fine, why don't they up the fine to solve the loss?

Finally as a side, do you think the reason people still think the Police are still benefiting from the collection of fines has something to do with mobile cameras being in police livery and even though their manned by civilian staff with consent from the chief constable?

I agree.  Although lets not pretend drug use had zero victims.  It can be part of a larger scale of issues that perpetuate social disorder.  But this will likely be police focus their effort, rather than on your average user.

Same way that individuals downloading pirated content are rarely target, but the distributors of said content.

Hopefully, if this trend of police letting cannabis use slide continues, we'll see firstly, less people with criminal records for what most consider is a silly offence, and eventually the legalisation of the substance

I don't dispute the fact that he was very good going forward for a defender,  possibly even one of the best in the world. However, I much prefer defenders to be solid defensively and Luis was not. The guy would actually step in and then get walked around. How is that even remotely acceptable for a professional fullback? Worse than that, after getting beat he wouldn't be hard back to correct his mistake, he would just [sort of jog.](http://gfycat.com/TalkativeRadiantCanary)

His positioning was lacking as well. He would get [drawn into the middle](https://gfycat.com/SlowBleakFrillneckedlizard) (again, notice how he just jogged to the top of the box to apply pressure?). And [here](http://www.gfycat.com/WhimsicalUnhappyGoldenmantledgroundsquirrel) he gets drawn into the middle because he's ball-watching and lets his man get a half step on him.  

Obviously it's hard to be a perfect defender, unless you're Terry, but the mistakes he made are fundamental errors. Azpilicueta's ability to go forward is hampered when he is playing on the left, and yet Luis never came close to displacing him. I would even dare to call his defending shaky at times.

null,false,Mobius6432,mccoy,McCoy,null,"Hmmm, this is an interesting question. In terms of how it will affect your understanding of series 8 and onwards, yes, you can probably skip all of Matt Smith's era. Clara's first story arc is tied up before series 8 and I don't think any mention of it is made at all. The first episode of series 8 might be a bit weird if you haven't watched 11's final episode, but other than that you will probably be fine. 

Now, I personally don't like series 5, for various reasons that aren't all that important right now, so I can understand why you would want to skip it. I might suggest, then, that you try series 6 or maybe even jump along to series 7b, starting with the Christmas special, *The Snowmen*. 

The Eleventh Doctor's personality *does* change over the course of the series and if you don't like how he is in series 5 then you could stick with it and see him change. The most drastic change is in series 7 but you might not notice it if you haven't seen series 5 and 6. 

The main problem with skipping 11 is that you'll miss *Night of the Doctor* and *Day of the Doctor*, since they do fall under his era, but watching from series 7b would probably solve any understanding issues you would have with those episodes. 

Hopefully that is a good answer to the question.

Apparently, it's more due to the fact that most attempts to fully secure the tunnel are likely to fail:

Most of the effort seems to be going into fencing off the entrances in France to stop people getting into the tunnel in the first place.

Everybody accepts that we want to have a redistributive tax system, the only question is how we balance that with the need to grow and to compete.

There are also several minisodes, as has been mentioned elsewhere, and various audio shorts such as *Rise and Fall*, comics such as *Are you Listening?* and prose short stories too that would probably qualify.

Wages haven't fallen in nominal terms. It's literally only inflation (which was in excess of 5% p.a. at one stage) coupled with stagnant nominal growth that's shrunk real income. I understand your point about global oil prices, but I don't understand why when you reason (correctly) that they are not influenced by the current government, spiking oil prices (or at least a slide in sterling's ability to buy dollar denominated oil) are ignored and everything is attributed to the government. 

&gt; Second point is the nub of the matter, I like people being able to get work but I think we need to be careful arguing that the two choices you put forward are the only ones. We could invest in support for those out of work, accept that there isn't ever going to be 100%employment and that it doesn't cost that much to support people who are unemployed.

That's not really up for debate. Labour has only ever had 2 leaders coming from the left of the party, the first was Foot, the second was Kinnock and he shifted right after his first defeat. 

That's beside the point anyway, you're ignoring Burnham's flip flopping, at the start of his campaign he was running as a centrist, rejecting union funding and backing welfare cuts(in his first C4 interview).

 Now he's suddenly picked up 2 ideas Corbyn has been talking about, renationalising the railways and the national health and care service you mentioned. Burnham has always been on the right of the party, he was a junior health minister when Blair rolled out the first PFIs, he was there when Blair accelerated internal markets in the NHS despite promising to get rid of them entirely. 

Blair also promised renationalisation of the railways and didn't deliver. He was a Blairite for a good long while and shifted towards a more centrist stance over a few years, now he's trying to tact left to pick up Corbyn's 2nd preferences. 

You've built up this image of him as an electable moderate, but that's Yvette Cooper, she's always been a Brownite, is great in the HoC and actually sticks to her position. She'll be my 2nd preference because I know where she stands. Burnham pandering to public opinion within the party won't win him elections. 

Honestly I don't like how you're trying to infer that I'm some kind of diehard Bolshie, who thinks Corbyn is the 2nd coming of Trotsky, for me he's the only one that understands what Labour is meant to be, a movement, it's not meant to be the democratic party in a race to the bottom with Tory-lite policy. It's meant to represent middle and low-income workers. 

I can't back Kendall because of her beliefs on keeping the private sector in the NHS among other things, I can't back Burnham because I don't know where he stands and more importantly I don't think he does. Cooper is a safe pair of hands that probably wouldn't win an election. 

Burnham is a mess who in my view, is completly unelectable due to the fact he will sway with public opinion no matter what it seems to be. The fact that Corbyn is so popular doesn't tell you that Labour party members are idiots, what you have to remember is if Corbyn were to win it would be the first time anyone born after 1975 would be able to vote for someone that represented old Labour values at a GE.

EDIT: Labour has not been a left-wing party since 1992 because after Blair took over he dropped Clause IV and entered them into a phase of ideological vagueness.

But I don't think it's fair to say there is ""no shit"" in the police or child protection system, considering they systematically failed to do their *job*. I do not accept ""I was afraid of being racist"" as an acceptable excuse for incompetene of such magnitude. No, I do not think they're more to blame than the actual rapists. No, I'm not trying to deflect the issue. I'm simply saying, if they were afraid of prosecuting them for rape because of being called racist, why then did this not apply ot every other crime commited by a racial minority?

""Sorry. I can't stop that guy who matches the description of the burgler. What if he accuses me of racism?""

""Sorry, I can't change that susptet for murder, what if he accuses me of racism""?

Think about any other time you would accept this as an acceptable excuse for incompetence by police or child protection services.

Could you get away with incompetence or failing to do *your* job by pulling the race card? Would your manager accept that? If you were a manager, would you accept that excuse from a member of staff who failed to do the job you employ them for? I don't think so. 

And even if the fear of being calld racist is valid, why the fuck should it matter if they are guilty and you can prove it?

""I'm not a rapist, he's just racist!""

""Yes you are, here's the evidence""

I've seen the compelling, widespread evidence for climate change and I'm genuinely worried for the future of our civilisation, if not our species (although I'm very sceptical of claims we're in the midst of a mass extinction event). We desperately need to reject short term thinking and embrace a sustainable future, we're tearing through the Earth's resources at an alarming rate before we've even secured extra-terrestrial alternatives. I want to be a member of a party that pushes the urgent need for action on climate change not just on the national, but international front.

Politically I consider myself a moderate, I believe in evidence based policy, although I am concerned with civil liberties and social justice more than anything. It seems to me that politics seems to go ideology -&gt; focus group -&gt; policy -&gt; legislation -&gt; debate -&gt; law when I would much rather it were treated in a scientific fashion along the lines of problem -&gt; proposed solutions -&gt; debate -&gt; trials -&gt; debates about evidence -&gt; policy -&gt; legislation -&gt; debate -&gt; law.

I haven't been very active in the party so far, it's mostly been correspondence, but since I've never been part of one before I feel a bit like a fish out of water.

In general the big O Notation describes how the time (or space) complexity of an algorithm grows depending on the size of the input (n).

For example: I want to look for the number 5 in the following strictly increasing list of numbers.

given:

    list: [1,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,16,17,19,22,25,27,28,29,30,33,34,36]

Now, we know that the numbers are sorted, we use that knowledge. For each section, for which we want to check whether or not it contains the number we are looking for, we check if the last number is greater than it.

1. check first half `[1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17]` - is 17 greater than 5? Yes. 5 must be somewhere in here then.

2. check first half of first half `[1, 3, 5, 6, 7]` - is 7 greater than 5? Yes. 5 must be somewhere in here then.

3. check first half of first half's first half `[1, 3, 5]` - uh, found our 5!

We only needed 3 comparisons to find the number. We didn't even look at the 2nd half of the initial list of numbers (`[19,22,25,27,28,29,30,33,34,36]`).
The complexity is `O(ln(n))` remember. N is the length of the input which is 20 here (20 numbers). What is `ln(20)`? It's 3 (rounded).

The naive approach would've been to just check each number one after another which leaves us with not 3 but potentially 20 steps (i.e. O(n)). Incidentally in this example it would've only required 3 steps too as 5 is the 3rd number, so maybe I should've used another number, but you get the point.

This limits defensively but you counter that by trying to holding 60%+ possession and by doing short quick passes. They also use their quickness advantage to close down on the ball higher up the pitch and start the cycle of rotating the ball all over again. We can't do this really because we don't have someone like Messi who can drop deeply and have the ball pretty much run through him when attacking. Sterling can make the runs off the ball that Neymar does and that Alexis did but I don't think Aguero can be the type of False-9 that Messi is even to a much diminished level. 

The 4-4-3 you posted is a more traditional midfield and puts more emphasis on traditional wing play than Barcelona's 4-3-3.

Look we're not monsters but the people who normally scream and shout about this stuff think we are so I'll answer coldly.  

Will this cause an upward trend of dog usage. Maybe. Dog experiments are very rare now days because they are not efficient. Rats are fantastic for the job because they're cheep and can be breed with specific traits. It takes a lot longer to make a dog, costs a lot more and drums up a lot of negativity from the public. If a scientist is asking for dogs it's because we NEED them. This farm will make dogs cheaper but it will allow funding to go further. 

Would I love to live in a world where we use simulated environments and plate cultures only? Sure I would but the fact is it's just not possible. We already do all that but at the end of the day before we put it in a human we need to see what it will do in a real organism. Biology is mind boggling complex with a interaction here an interaction there. By the time we go to do anything to an animal we are 99% sure what it will do. But in a full organism random stuff always happens.

Will the animals be treated cruelly. That I can't answer 100% but normally no more than it has to be. Number one we're people we don't like hurting animals and if you don't buy that it's bad for science. The article mentions vivisection. I have been working in labs in a variety of forms for well over 30 years I have only ever seen one vivisection and the person performing it got into a lot of trouble. It's rarely used for science. The word vivisection isn't normally used correctly it's become a term for a lot of different procedures including autopsy. But I can pretty much guarantee anybody who does needs dogs for real vivisection is already getting them this would just allow funding to go further.

And you're grossly undervaluing how Luis played, he was better then average but definitely not as good as his previous season at Atletico. What I'm trying to say is that there would be a better balance if Dave played right back and Luis played left back, but to switch Dave in the middle of the season would be difficult. 

Also unless you can't put 2 and 2 together it shouldn't be some mystery why Luis was unable to replicate his form at Atletico. Any player regardless of how they are wouldn't be as good as the previous year if they aren't playing consistently. Plus when Luis did play (most games were cup matches or bottom table teams) he was playing with other players who also didn't play consistently, Mikel, Zouma, Drogba ect.

null,false,rappersdo,null,null,null,"Burnham has been flip-flopping though. He said he would oppose the welfare cuts and made a big deal out of it with Harman, then abstained and opposed a 2nd reading, which would be ok but the Tories have a majority, so it's still a split vote, he said he'd take a stand and then compromised as not to go against the party, that's not leadership.

 He said the manifesto was the best he ever ran on, after the election he added the caveat that he only meant specifically in his constituency. 

That's what I mean by flip-flopping, he's saying one thing and then doing the other, very weak in my opinion. Cooper is a much stronger candidate if you're looking for a centrist.

While Corbyn may be too left for some people's taste, if you look at the platform he's running on it's really nothing controversial. He's said himself he'd have a broad church cabinet(Something Cooper and Kendall have ruled out). 

That's why Corbyn's the perfect choice, he's willing to give straight answers to straight questions and meet people in the middle in real terms, not the ideological middle.

 The right of the party can't wrap their heads round why people are backing him so much and have resorted to the same fear tactics used by the Tories against Ed in the election, but Corbyn doesn't get involved in personal attacks so they're just barking at the moon.

 Corbyn has also stated he'd hold a leadership election in 2018 if elected leader. That should be enough in itself, considering how weak all 3 other candidates have been.

I'd consider myself on the left of the party and Corbyn has said a lot of things that haven't been said for a long time. He's finally stood up to Labour's bonkers stance on the EU, that we'd vote in even if Cameron traded away a lot of workers rights as he apparently intends to attempt.

Those came before the losses to United and Arsenal and had nothing to do with them.  The mentality was clearly off for the majority of the season and it doesn't stem from the two games you want it to.  Why are you so insistent that one player dropped the whole team from 2 performances?  It makes absolutely no sense in the context of the season, ESPECIALLY with how the first few months and then the last few months in total played out.  We should have plenty of leadership personalities around to handle that and push the lads on (where was Gerrard's inspiriational leadership?  Or Henderson stepping up?  People like to scream about Skrtel being a good leader and captain/vice captain candidate, how come he didn't galvanize the squad?  Where the hell was Rodgers when it came to getting the players up for the game and hungry to win?).  There was absolutely a deeper problem that goes far beyond Moreno (I still can't believe we're trying to say 1 player in a squad of 20+ under performing players was the death of the season), and it plagued the entire season, not just 2 games.

Have you ever played a sport or other competitive activity (ideally team based) in a very serious environment?  I've played team sports my entire life including D1 college soccer (which I don't even consider a high level, and it's obviously nowhere even close to even the MLS let alone the Premier League, but it was still a very serious, competitive, focused environment) and I can tell you that no one player, especially a young one in his first season at the club, could destroy the whole team's mindset like that without doing something far more catastrophic than playing badly a couple of times.  In fact, having suffered some seriously bitter losses myself, while it can be disorienting for a moment, it really ignites you more and creates a bigger hunger to win, to put it right.  That's a cornerstone of the serious athlete's mindset right there and if you just bow out and break from a hard loss then  you're not cut out for it.  I guarantee you every player in our squad is cut out for it, they can stomach the losses and drive themselves to do better.  If they couldn't then they never would have made it anywhere near the level they're at today.

*Dude*. 

If you're young, and just getting into soccer, that's fine. I'm gonna assume you're American, like myself. We have the ""luxury"" of getting to ""pick"" a team to like, though you should also be supporting local soccer, like an MLS or NASL team or something close to you, however you can. When you ""pick"" an overseas team, there are tons of valid reasons to do so. Maybe you saw them on TV while flipping the channels, and you witnessed a sporting spectacle, like when we beat Arsenal 5-1 two seasons ago, or our 4-0 at the Bernabeu in 09. Maybe you really admired a player, for example, Steven Gerrard, one of the greatest players in the history of England and one of the greatest midfielders world football has ever seen, one for the history books. Or maybe you saw them win the Champion's League, and went ""I like them now because they're the best."" which most people will tell you is gloryhunting, and it is, but that doesn't matter so much if you stick with the team down the line, forever, through thick and thin. 

You can like something more personally than something that is undisputably ""better"", like supporting Crystal Palace instead of Barcelona. You pick a football team because you feel a connection. Whether that's because of a friend, or because of a memory or a moment or a player that sticks with you, that's what you do. You don't pick a team because ""they're the best"". You do it because it feels right. ",null,0,null,1438113591,null,0,false,0,ctjdvu7,null,t3_3exrke,null,t1_ctjdvu7,null,t1_ctjdj8a,null,null,null,1440141225,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

&gt;I wouldn't have really supported making the bids public except for the fact they were insultingly low. That's not ""negotiating"", it's lowballing. I'm all for naming-and-shaming clubs who try to swipe cheeky discounts like this.

http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/dundee-united-to-launch-new-bid-for-scott-allan-1-3834206

&gt;United are also keen on the midfielder, however. They were rebuffed when they tried to tempt Hibs with a £250,000 bid on deadline day during the January transfer window.

Stubbs reply to that ?

Another example would be the time I submitted a picture of the first sunrise of 2015 to /r/pics.

You may want to ask your HR team about your pension - there will almost certainly be someone who has responsibility for it and knows how it all works. Alternatively, ask anyone in your company over 45 - they're usually clued up about the company pension for obvious reasons:) 

The compound interest thing is a bit of a red herring for your investment but you've done two things right - started investing reasonably young and levered in the maximum employer contribution. Good luck for the next 30 years!

Nunchucks, Hollow spike Kubatans, Swords, flick knives, butterfly knives, locking knives, battle axes, maces, Each one of those is illegal to carry on the street/public place (Offensive weapons, Sec 1 Prevention of Crime Act 1953). However, you can happily have them in your home, on a stand, by the bed. And is some poor unfortunate burglar happens to startle you in your sleep, and you, fearing for your life happen to grab your claymore and lop an arm off, well, that's his problem.

Very few things are as enshrined in UK law as the right of someone to defend themselves and their home, using reasonable force. IN fact, Householders get a specific clause allowing them to use *disproportionate* force in the defence of themselves and their family - [Sec 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, Subsection 5A.](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#a01). It also clarifies that in the heat of the moment it is not possible to weigh up the niceties of the exact level of force required and that Juries and courts should account for that.

If the burglar is running away and you expertly kebab him with a shiruken, you might be in trouble. But if you fear for your life, and in defence arm yourself, and the intruder comes off worse, then that is their problem, not yours.

I became a fan as a kid. My soccer coach in like U10 or U11 was an avid Spurs fan, and I picked it up off of him. As I got older and the PL became more and more accessible in the US, people began choosing their favorite clubs. Usually, this was due to news/buzz/place in the table. You ended up with a lot of Man U, Chelsea, and fans of that other fucking London club.  
  
Fast forward to present day. I live in Chicago. There is a solid soccer community in the city, with a few big soccer bars that get rather crowded on match days. The Scum, Chelsea, Liverpool....all the big clubs go to The Globe to watch their teams. Only Yids go to The Atlantic, the designated pub of Spurs Chicago. Spurs may not have the largest fanbase in the city, but, as far as I know, we're the only club to have a set meeting place that is wall-to-wall crowded at 7 AM on a Sunday (and home-baked pastries for those early AM games....whomever makes those is a gem).
  
The point is: Spurs will never have the American fanbase of a perennial Top-4 club. We don't need it. We don't want it.

The problem was having a balance between defense and attack. When we were strong defensively we couldn't score and when we were more attacking we left holes in the back, especially down the flanks.

We've (hopefully) adressed this problem now with the players we've signed. Firmino and Benteke are massive goalscoring threats especially from counter attacking situations, admittedly losing Sterling is a blow but Ibe looks like he can step up and Markovic can do a job there too. Milner adds solidity and creativity to the midfield and Clyne is a top class full back and improves the back 4 a huge amount.

Finally, I feel Henderson is going to come out of his shell this season and out of the shadow of Stevie G. 

I'm more optimistic this season than I was last. Last season I knew losing Suarez was going to hurt us bad and we hadn't signed anyone of the required quality to replace him. This season I'm optimistic of a serious top 4 challenge. I think that if one of the big 4 slip up we'll be in there and if they don't and we finish 5th, there will be a big gap between us and 6th.

* Clark is beastly with his tackles. If his tackling isn't at least 16+, maybe 17+ on FM16, I'll be mad!

On 3, I'm guessing you believe this will raise your credit score. I would do some more research to check this - there may be other factors that are equally valuable. I've never bothered with mine, and have never been turned down for a loan - but I'm not suggesting you should be equally casual!

On 2, you might want to differentiate more clearly between short, medium and long term goals. Short term, putting aside some emergency cash is good idea. This need not be £000s - be sensible about exactly what emergencies might crop up (you have no home, so no need for, say, a new boiler, your grandparents don't live in America (I'm guessing) so need for emergency flight money, your Porsche won't need new tyres etc etc etc). If you have a fairly modest lifestyle, your emergency fund may be fairly modest too (one way to calculate it is some multiple of your normal monthly expenditure). This can be put into an easy access online account, but maybe do a little research - I just leave mine in my current account as it earns reasonable interest.

Medium term you talk about buying a house (and a car?). You may want to consider a target for this and then direct debit it to a savings account. Whether you choose stocks and shares or cash ISA probably won't make a vast difference given your timescale and with interest rates the way they are at the moment. A cash ISA would perhaps give you a little more certainty for planning (as you know the (paltry) return you'll get). I'm not an expert however.

Long term is your pension. Using your employer pension is no brainer. How much you decide to contribute is a balance between this and all the other calls on your income.

No, this is quite clearly a cash cow for the BBC Worldwide,  and one which only the more hardcore fans, like you and I, would be interested in.

Why is this USA only? Hell, wouldn't it have been cheaper to have it shown in more countries so the production cost of converting it into 3D would be more spread out?

&gt; 'I need to give players minutes. I need to give players different experiences, playing with each other and also playing in different positions. It's just about preparation. Obviously nobody likes to lose even in training but if we wanted to win we would choose opponents where we could win easily.

&gt; 'This time, because we have a short pre-season and not a long time to be ready for the Premier League, we decided to play proper opponents and have proper training matches to raise the level.'

&gt; With regards to his team selection tonight, and specifically how he will distribute playing time around his squad,  Mourinho explains there is one area of the pitch where he has little choice in the matter right now.

&gt; 'Defenders I have to give 90 minutes to because at this moment I have only five. Between the five we must have four on the pitch and so for the defenders I have to do it.

The Barclay stand is between the die-hard Norwich fans and the away fans so if atmosphere is what you want, look no further. It is a stand behind the goal however so you probably get a worse view. 

The n&amp;amp;p stand is the stand behind the other goal. The corner between it and the city stand is the family area - so probably avoid it, and to be honest I wouldn't pick tickets in this stand if you have the choice, as my experiences with it (although others might correct me) is that it lacks the atmosphere of the Barclay stand, whilst not providing the view that the Jarrold does.

Speaking of the Jarrold stand, this is the biggest stand going the horizontal length of the pitch. I'd rate the atmosphere 6/10 (better than N&amp;amp;P, worse than Barclay), but you obviously get the best views here. 

If I were to choose I'd go Barclay as my no.1 choice, then Jarrold, then N&amp;amp;P, but that's just me.

Also, something I found useful when we isn't have season tickets (4ish years ago so it might of changed) is to not go through the website - it always crashes because so many people are trying to use it at once. Instead, find the phone number for ticketing (check it the day before), and use that. You will be placed in a queue, but it was never over 100 people for me, and it's a lot less hassle, and probably quicker than going online.

Also, right now, seeing Ed back in the Cabinet would be quite comforting.

Let's say that, hypothetically, Andy Burnham drops out. Voters who picked him as first-preference have to choose another candidate, but his 20% or so of the vote won't help any candidate catch up with Corbyn, being as it will be split between Corbyn and the other two.

Now the people who had him as a second-preference have to make a decision. The general suggestion is that most people voting for Burnham/Cooper/Kendall in the first place are doing so despite Corbyn's popularity, and so they'd be unlikely to back him whatever happens.

Now the second-preference voters (who, it's assumed, will be more likely to back Cooper than Corbyn) just need to add 2% more onto Yvette Cooper's second-preference pile than they add onto Corbyn's and she's won in the second round.

A previous article argued that the party has moved left as a response to the shock of electoral defeat - I'm inclined to think that what has happened is the party is actually doing the reverse; the electoral defeat is making the party look at the Conservatives and ask 'What are they doing that we aren't?' and drawing up the wrong answers.

We have poll after poll about what turned voters off from Labour, and I think these polls combined with this 'Culture of Blair' worship that is going on is more likely to lead the party into the wilderness than anything else. Instead of battling to take the theoretical middle ground, Labour should be looking to expand the middle ground into their own territory by moving the debate left instead of being reactionary to what voter groups claim at a policy level.

Corbyn is the right choice at this moment because, whether he wins or he loses, people are recognising that he stands for something different; that Labour could stand for something different. We have people backing him expecting a train wreck - they will be listening to watch and see what he says towards that end - What if they end up agreeing with what he says? Even if they don't want to vote Labour, if he is able to coherently criticise government policy, Labour will be able to put up an effective opposition.

Frankly I want a Labour Party that is more than just a Soup Of The Day when it comes down to it.

Interesting article from the Telegraph (and the comments are brilliant as usual) who have changed their tune substantially from when they were talking about Tories for Corbyn. Here are the choice cuts:

&gt;The real battle within Labour is not between Left and Right but between ancient and modern. But blinded by their own nostalgia, Jeremy Corbyn’s critics have failed to see that he is anything but a relic of the past. Mr Corbyn is in fact a figure of sparkling modernity and thus more dangerous than his adversaries can yet imagine. 

&gt;f bins go unemptied and the elderly unfed, then Mr Corbyn will seem vindicated. Meanwhile, the young voters backing him do not regard his anti-Trident stance as a reminder of Labour’s unilateralist madness. They think, rightly, that £60 billion is a lot of money for the antiquated and unusable Cold War deterrent to which the other candidates cleave.

&gt;Even Mr Corbyn’s old-fashioned views, on issues such as renationalisation, have a voguish ring, while his lifestyle choices of cycling and not drinking strike a chord with a frugal generation. Attuned to the politics of identity, he senses voters’ yearnings and the beat of his party’s Eurosceptic heart.  

&gt;That is what made him so potentially dangerous to David Cameron and to Britain. Having refused to rule out campaigning for a No vote, Mr Corbyn yesterday appeared to soften his stance, saying he would work with European allies. Germany’s brutal handling of the Greek crisis has allowed nationalism to flourish and put 70 years of European peace at risk. 

&gt;“It’s like looking at a paint colour chart,” says one senior Labour adviser. “People might not be sure if they could live with Corbyn red, but they think it’s preferable to three shades of magnolia.” If Labour is to survive, the candidates must adopt more vivid hues. But first, Labour’s centrists must realise that they, not Mr Corbyn, are the antediluvian wing of a party whose core vote has evaporated, whose ability to reforge social democracy is slight and whose vision is unremittingly myopic. 

And this is the thing - having a Labour party (or it's leader) campaign against the EU is very dangerous for the Tories and very dangerous for UKIP. It will undercut a lot of their support if he starts winning back eurosceptic voters. It could make the difference in a close referendum. After what happened to Greece it will be hard for Labour to put out a pro EU position that doesn't seem like a sell out to neo-liberalism.

Things like this are what makes the thought of Corbyn as leader so terrifying for the Tories, for all their bravado he's a wildcard and I don't think the old attacks of ""Red!"" are going to resonate to a generation born post Cold War. Making confident predictions about how the electorate is supposed to be behave, presuming to say what is or isn't electable, is a foolish thing in the current environment. People have been paying more attention to how the left papers attack Corbyn but it's worth seeing what the right are saying too, how does Corbyn look through the eyes of an intelligent conservative?",null,0,null,1438119415,null,0,1438129056,0,ctjhz5n,null,t3_3exjrh,null,t1_ctjhz5n,null,t3_3exjrh,null,null,null,1440143154,null,40,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,40,null

Man City is literally funded with oil money (I believe, could be wrong). They consistently throw money around and I believe they are in favour of the regression of Financial Fair Play so that they don't get sanctioned for running a club improperly in terms of economic security.

When a clubs owners decides to sell up, or go bankrupt, or suddenly oil prices drop and lose a small fortune (Abramovic for example), this can result in clubs forcing redundancies having to sell large quantities of players, with risk of supporters losing their club. To many, their identity is being a supporter of that club, and seeing them each week. These clubs were founded by people with hero, and legend status. 

Mostly, clubs never really go bust in England. There are rare exceptions. However, there will always be a clubs supporters association that will gather enough cash to provide for the rights to the club. This is documented in Soccernomics.

If Man City do run the club properly, however, then fair play to them. Providing it isn't dependent on oil money, which, eventually, will fade.

From where we sat, Targett made one early mistake, then spent the rest of the game blocking, tackling, and running brilliantly. And that ignores the beautiful pass to Tadic to set up the first goal.  

From what I've seen, Juanmi has been good, but no better than many of our attackers, and against Feyenoord the only time he popped up was the goal. He was only on for about 30 minutes which practically means that he would have to be incredible to have set the world alight in that time , or even been one of the better players. We were less attacking when he came on, despite the goal, which was mostly from a long ball and Long's good work (though I will grant you Juanmi did finish it well).

You are paid a salary to do a job.  If you choose to do something related to your work outside of job hours, for free, then that's very nice of you, but you're still employed by them, you're still paid a salary by them, and that salary covers all the work you do - regardless of whether you happen to be in the building at the time or whether the big hand on the clock is between 9 and 5.

They will say that there's no expectation on you to do that extra work and therefore if you don't want to work for them for free outside of your scheduled hours then you should do work-related tasks only during work hours.  But anything work-related that you do, you are doing as their employee, and as part of their company, and therefore the work you generate belongs to them and is theirs to profit from.  They are buying *all* your labour from you, not just the labour that happens to fall within your scheduled hours.

Personally I can see the logic in it.  Like I said, if you really think you've got a good idea here, I would probably take legal advice.  What I would not do is come up with some sort of ""gentleman's agreement"" with a friend where they keep the property rights on paper but you still get a cut, because if there are any disputes in the future (which are likely to be friendship-shattering), the court won't care about anything except the paper agreement.",null,0,null,1438120188,null,0,false,0,ctjii0h,null,t3_3ewzp1,null,t1_ctjii0h,null,t1_ctji3yk,null,null,null,1440143401,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

If I have an issue with my TalkTalk internet, I get on the TalkTalk forums with my 3G, leave a message for their tech guys detailing the problem and what I want doing, and it gets sorted. It takes me five minutes. If you're unfortunate enough not to know what you're doing and end up going through one of their call centres in India, you're going to have a bad time.

Hi all,

Selling this monitor. I bought it at the same time as my 21:9 monitor and it just doesn't get used at all. It's a great monitor, and G Sync is a blessing, I just enjoy the large aspect ratio of my other monitor. I have the box still so it can be sent in that. 

The monitor is literally like new. I have even left the protective plastic on the bezel, and the information sticker on the front.

I also have the Display Port cable that I'll include.

I'm looking for around £400, but will take offers (if anyone has a MGSV Phantom Pain Code, I'd knock £50 off the asking price).

Cheers.

Line rental is how BT can afford to tear up roads and build a modern infrastructure.

Doesn't matter what you call it but we have to have ""line rental"" to fund the physical aspect of our internet.

Don't be fooled by Sky etc who make BT sound like the evil one. Sky et al are the ones screwing BT over and subsequently the public in refusing to put enough money into investing into fibre and what not as they see it as BTs job.

Alternatively, just like mobile phones did - if you are old enough to remember.
Mobiles also had line rental, but that was moved and funded differently by usage. So in reality mobile phone users who use very little mins/sms/data may actually cost the provider more than it costs to service the user.

This would mean for internet users much cheaper low end internet - say a tenner for 30GBs. But the gap left over from the true cost to what is actually brought in would mean the high end users would have to pay more than the 40 a month for unlimited. 

Also don't be fooled by Virgin Media, their true costs are not much different than what it would be to have BT or Sky broadband - (comparable products).

null,false,JohnKimble111,null,null,null,"I don't know much at all about Scottish politics, but I have read extensively on Rumbles and his past work concerning domestic violence.

The facts are that Rumbles forced the Scottish Parliament to debate the issue of violence against men, just as they had previously debated violence against women (note that we're not fortunate enough to have a Rumbles-type figure in the UK Parliament and therefore are still yet to have the violence against men debate there). It took Rumbles some ELEVEN years of campaigning for the debate to happen and clearly there was massive resistance to his work

It's clear from his performance in the debate (and the fact hat he initiated it) that Rumbles is very firmly on the side of gender equality and simply wants to help all victims of domestic violence rather than just half the population. If campaigning to help all such victims makes you ""anti-feminist"" than surely most of the UK population fit that definition too.

I read through the entire violence against men debate and the only sexism and offensive comments came from Labour and to a lesser extent the SNP, with other Lib Dems and a Conservative siding with Rumbles. Labour even tried to introduce amendments to the debate which were clearly total fabrications and their lies were exposed for all to see. The lies in question were put forward put Johann Lamont who went on to become Labour leader! She even dared to suggested that male victims of domestic violence were lying about being abused.

I wasn't aware that the debate had caused a rift afterwards, but if standing up for all victims of domestic violence rather than a only a privileged subset of victims causes such a problem then Labour are clearly an extremely unpleasant party in Scotland and not someone the Lib Dems should be working with. It's surely far better to stand up for equality and what you believe in than worry about offending a coalition partner with differing and seemingly hateful views (not to mention blatant lies).

Even after Rumbles' work, the Scottish situation was such that for every pound spent on male victims there was £3,500 spent on females!

basic pay, including any money owed because the employee is paid a week (or more) in hand

Bonuses and commission

overtime

holiday pay

maternity, paternity and adoption pay

sick pay

pay in lieu of notice


All employees are entitled to receive an itemised pay statement which should give a breakdown of the money s/he has been given. It is important that the employee checks the statement as soon as s/he gets it, to make sure s/he has been paid everything s/he is owed.


Note about holiday pay... 

Holiday pay owed by the employer. 

Most workers are entitled to 4.8 weeks' (5.6 weeks' from 1 April 2009) paid holiday per leave year. An employee may be entitled to more than this under her/his contract of employment. If an employee's employment ends, s/he has a right to pay in lieu for any of her/his statutory holiday entitlement which s/he has not taken. S/he may have rights to more holiday pay in lieu under her/his contract. Statutory holiday pay (and therefore statutory holiday pay in lieu) is paid at the same rate as a normal week's pay for each week of leave. A worker may be entitled to higher holiday pay than normal pay if her/his contract specifies this.

So as well as the weeks wages, you might be entitled to money based on holiday entitlement you have not taken. 


The above information is based on English employment law. 

For_shaame is right.  Visit your local CAB who will be able to help you identify what outstanding monies you are entitled to, as well as assist you in putting a letter together to send to your ex employer.

null,false,harryman100,null,null,null,"&gt;It's ex council.. The one that sold for £118K is *literally* the exact same layout. They all are. Maybe to a slightly higher standard of decoration, which is what I intend to correct anyway. 

I live on an estate with a reasonable number of identical houses, all built at the same time, to the same spec about 40 years ago. The prices range from 90k to 125k based only on the decoration. However the difference in decorative standard is HUGE. Spending a couple of thousand here and there is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the value. 

You plan to fix up the house with money from a loan and replies on the valuation being improved, what happens if your work uncovers hidden costs? What happens if the work is done poorly and doesn't increase the valuation as much as you expect? What happens if all the other houses are selling for more than their official valuation?

null,false,JohnKimble111,null,null,null,"I don't know much at all about Scottish politics, but I have read extensively on Rumbles and his past work concerning domestic violence.

The facts are that Rumbles forced the Scottish Parliament to debate the issue of violence against men, just as they had previously debated violence against women (note that we're not fortunate enough to have a Rumbles-type figure in the UK Parliament and therefore are still yet to have the violence against men debate there). It took Rumbles some ELEVEN years of campaigning for the debate to happen and clearly there was massive resistance to his work

It's clear from his performance in the debate (and the fact hat he initiated it) that Rumbles is very firmly on the side of gender equality and simply wants to help all victims of domestic violence rather than just half the population. If campaigning to help all such victims makes you ""anti-feminist"" than surely most of the UK population fit that definition too.

I read through the entire violence against men debate and the only sexism and offensive comments came from Labour and to a lesser extent the SNP, with other Lib Dems and a Conservative siding with Rumbles. Labour even tried to introduce amendments to the debate which were clearly total fabrications and their lies were exposed for all to see. The lies in question were put forward put Johann Lamont who went on to become Labour leader! She even dared to suggested that male victims of domestic violence were lying about being abused.

I wasn't aware that the debate had caused a rift afterwards, but if standing up for all victims of domestic violence rather than a only a privileged subset of victims causes such a problem then Labour are clearly an extremely unpleasant party in Scotland and not someone the Lib Dems should be working with. It's surely far better to stand up for equality and what you believe in than worry about offending a coalition partner with differing and seemingly hateful views (not to mention blatant lies).

Even after Rumbles' work, the Scottish situation was such that for every pound spent on male victims there was £3,500 spent on females!

In fact migrants have quicker access to housing and benefits if they stay in France.

The charity also said that many of them have been taught or know English, and want to use the language.

I don't really know enough about French politics and race/religion/socioeconomic issues in France to have a full understanding of what exactly BAE's tweet a few years ago means, however,I think his work involving in charities aimed at African issues and trying to help out people from different countries in Africa is often overlooked and he really gets a lot of hate from this sub. I also think he would have been a perfectly adequate back up/split time with Rose the past few years (though, that is not to say Davies is not wonderful for what he does at our club). Basically I think one tweet ruined people's opinions of him around here and a lot of good work he has done for tottenham (after the riots) and elsewhere gets overlooked. But like I said up top, I have no idea how terrible in scope what he said was and if it really is akin to neo-nazism level anti-semitism, and it is something he full well knew and not just him not understanding the severity of his comment, then I agree with kicking him out and making him leave as there is no place for anti-semitism, or any prejudice, at this club or in this world.


 I also think Adebayor gets waaay to much shit. One day everyone is willing to shit on him, the next we want to point out how hard his life has been with his family or how he pays (or makes a stand) for much of the Togolese national teams issues where his less famous teammates really don't have as much power. All this is to say that people love to shit on him without thinking about all the stuff that may be going down in his life. seriously, if you were having the life issues Adebayor apparently has think about how it would affect your job, and then on top of it have a bunch of nameless people who don't know you, railing against you for being lazy, not earning your wages from your employer, and calling you a PoS all the time.

basically, this sub is really fucking toxic towards some players at our club and I think we all need to take a step back and realize these people are human beings, many of them from very difficult backgrounds who have made it this far against immeasurable odds. Cut them some fucking slack. criticize their on field performance, criticize horrible things they say, but unless you know them personally don't fucking go after their personal life or try to make them out to be something you know nothing about.

**West Ham** looks tremendously improved, but faces the challenge of Europa.

**Everton** will be looking to reestablish themselves as the 'best of the rest' and they have a squad very capable of doing that. The addition of Deulofeu paired with keeping Stones makes them rather threatening.

**Stoke** are looking very dangerous going forward. Bojan and Affelay are prolific on their day, Diouf was quite adequate up front as well. Mix in Van Ginkel and the 4 orcs they usually line the back with and you've got a tough team to beat.

**Southampton** and **Spurs** will be ever present as always.

And then you've got a **Newcastle** team that has already added substantial offensive talent and looks to finally be replacing that shit awful backline.

The level of social disorder of any type is lower in cannabis than just about every other social drug. Most users are not victims. With that in mind, growers/dealers (who don't take advantage of the vulnerable) are not creating victims and should be left alone. The police's priority should always be to make the world a better/less worse place. Any criminality is inherent to making it illegal, rather than inherent to drugs themselves and this would cease to be an issue if drugs were no longer illegal.

The issue of internet piracy is a case of the movie and TV creators insisting on sticking with an outmoded business model - one which does not fit the reality of the convenience demanded by the modern world.

They're making the same mistake the music companies made when they refused to capitalise on the Napster boom. Music piracy was rampant and then services like iTunes and Spotify came along, filled the gap in the market and profited instead of the old guard.

It doesn't really matter much, though. What matters is in general how the complexity grows. For instance these ordered from fast to slow:

* constant (it doesn't - it always takes a constant time independent from the input size): O(1)
* logarithmic growth: O(log(n)) ([graph]
(http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%28x%29+%3D+log%28x%29))
* linear growth: O(n) ([graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%28x%29+%3D+2x))
* quadratic growth: O(x^2) ([graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%28x%29+%3D+x%5E2))
* exponential growth: O(exp(n)) ([graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%28x%29+%3D+exp%28x%29))

It helps to look at the graphs. The less rapid they grow the better the performance of the algorithm. You will notice that the graphs for `ln` and `log_2` look pretty similar.

One says that the big O notation describes the complexity *class*, the most important ones of which are listed above (constant, linear etc.).

`log_e(n)`, `log_2(n)`, `log_10(n)` and `log_whathaveyou(n)` all fall into the same complexity class of `O(log(n))` (logarithmic).

Just as as `f(x) = 2x + 3`, `f(x) = 10x - 10` and `f(x) = 500x` are all in the same class of `O(n)` (linear). 

The argument is that those factors can be ignored because they are constant. You can reduce them by using a faster computer for instance. I.e. `500x` becomes `100x` if I use my gaming computer instead of my laptop. That doesn't change the general complexity of the algorithm, though. In any case - which ever computer I use - running the algorithm with 200 numbers is gonna take twice as long as 100 numbers.",null,0,null,1438127163,null,0,1438186258,0,ctjmw77,null,t3_3evsf8,null,t1_ctjmw77,null,t1_ctjkww9,null,null,null,1440145537,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I don't work for Chelsea so I can only speculate why he's starting. As the transfer hasn't been officially confirmed, this may be Kenedy's 'audition' so to speak. If he impresses, he goes off on loan somewhere to gain a work permit; if not, he heads back to Fluminense. 

Another factor to consider is that Kenedy hasn't actually played a lot of first team football, so there is little to convince possible loan suitors of his skills. If he can hold his own against the champions of Europe for even 45 minutes, that may be enough to impress some suitors and secure him a loan to a club superior to Vitesse.

It's really annoying me that I can't remember the exact quote, or even who said it (I know, great source right) .. but I remember someone who had played with him at one point saying he was the worst professional they'd ever encountered.. so yeah, there's that.

The disparity in spending is at least in part down to the disparity in frequency and in outcome. [ONS statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/focus-on-violent-crime-and-sexual-offences--2013-14/index.html) show the rates of abuse amongst women as 4% higher than amongst men - almost double.

It is absolutely true that men die violently considerably more often than women, but violent relationships account for almost half of all killings of women in the UK. As you can see from the second link, the number of women killed by their partners/ex also considerably exceeds the number of men killed by partners/ex in real terms.

If we were to eradicate domestic violence against men we'd save a fraction of men killed in this country. Better to focus on other forms of crime to save men. If we eradicated domestic violence against women then we would save almost half of all women killed. It would also be a larger number of lives saved.

null,false,Crimsoneer,eu,London,null,"Sorry, but you're hugely, hugely over-estimating the amount of time the average amount of time police officers will spend investigating this level of crime.  Generally, if there is no coverage *of the actual crime scene*, it won't even be investigated.  If your initial investigating officer was particularly keen, and noted that there was CCTV up the road that might cover it, it *might* get looked at if your time window is less than 20 minutes either way.  If it's an overnight crime?  You can dream on, that is getting closed right away.  There is not a snowballs chance in hell of *anybody* looking at other cctv in the area.

Again, look at those numbers earlier.  £20 per hour of officer time reviewing CCTV, with a less than 5% chance of arresting a suspect, for £250 of property.  It's just not a good use of time.  Harsh, but true.

Also, keep in mind this is probably being investigated by your neighbourhood PC.

That's not my argument. I'm telling you why I think an increase in usage would be a bad thing.

But even so that isn't true. If you saw someone about to jump off a building would you try to talk them down? I would.

Right, but I'm not going to let other people take decisions which might have a very harmful effect me and my kin.

Well if it's not the majority then you are admitting that MORE people drive more dangerously when stoned. Therefore the net effect is the roads are more dangerous.

No, that's not my whole argument.

Might as well face it buddy, you're a twat who bullies people doing their jobs. Imagine for a second if you will, a client of yours treating you in the same way you treat people over the phone. 

You genuinely believe that you're holding the moral highground, which is pretty worrying in a way. You even admitted to screaming down the phone at people trying to do their jobs whilst you wouldn't let them. 

You claim that they refused to contact Openreach, but when they did contact Openreach, you wouldn't let them, because you didn't want an engineer. What do you think contacting Openreach involves exactly if you don't mind me asking? Do you think they parachute mimes into your backgarden to give you a jolly little performance? Or could it be... could it just be... could it possibly be that Openreach dispach an engineer to run some remote tests on your line to locate the fault?

It generally aims to address situations where malicious or erroneous provisions have been put into the will. 

For example, in *Iqbal v Ahmed* a woman who had been married to her husband for 22 years (and who had an estate of £115,000) was left £8,000 and the rights to live in the family home, but not to own it outright. The home needed £30,000 of repairs. The woman would have had to move out of her home and have her life significantly affected by someone who should have been providing for her. The judge ruled similarly as in this case.

In this case the judge ruled that the allocations to charities had been done maliciously rather than out of genuine desire to give it to them, and that the daughter was entitled to reasonable provision. 

Read the judgment first on judiciary.gov.uk before you come back to it and spout off again.

The result of this is that our population pyramid went from somewhat [triangular shaped](http://i.gyazo.com/5c25a763fae045f92ce3987c4aa980c2.png) to what [it is today](http://i.gyazo.com/88fc999be089973a05bd91e6a4061ed7.png), more resembling a sort of diamond or house shaped structure.

What could have solved this problem? Maintaining our fertility rate is one, or bringing in more young immigrants is another. As long as your base stays the same size it's much more healthy in terms of demographics. It doesn't need to increase in size, it just needs to stay the same size. There is no ponzi scheme here at all, the damage has already been done, but immigration can help alleviate the problem.

The process is always the same. Log the fault on the generic backoffice system, Openreach pick it up. Control dispaches engineer who remotely tests the line, if no fault is found on the network they update the backoffice system with the information that the end user needs to recheck fault and book an engineer appointment if it persists. Reseller periodically checks system for updates, if engineer appointment is requested by Openreach they contact the customer and arrange it.

From the point where the fault is logged, it's out of the resellers hands. They have zero control over what the engineer does or where they go. First port of call is always the network however, never end user address. That would be mental.

If you had followed the Openreach procedure instead of throwing your rattle out of the pram, your issue would have been fixed a lot sooner. Instead you decided you knew better and tried to tell other people how to do their jobs, delaying your fault getting fixed and angering you in the process.

And for some bizarre reason you think it's all TalkTalk's fault.

Scottish League Cup - Most Successful Club: [Rangers with 27](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_League_Cup)

Rangers also hold the world record for most trebles with seven. Should Rangers win the First Division title and Challenge Cup this season then the Club will have won every major domestic honour as well as the three domestic minor leagues and minor cup. In other words every existing domestic honour.

Even with Glasgow Cups, Rangers are on 47 with Celtic on 28. The Glasgow Merchants Charity trophy is tied with 28 from both Glasgow clubs.

But yes, my point that Rangers have won every major domestic honour in Scotland more than any other side in the country, apart from the Scottish Cup which they are three behind, is very accurate.

Rangers are the most honoured and successful club in Scottish football.",null,1,null,1438134113,null,0,false,0,ctjr2v2,null,t3_3ex05d,null,t1_ctjr2v2,null,t1_ctjmfjv,null,null,null,1440147508,null,1,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1,null

Low-effort comments are things like off-hand remarks of any length that don't make any real point; tribal insults towards a particular group or party; quoting single words from the title of a linked article as if to suggest doubt in its sincerity of use; advice animals, etc. What exactly is considered low-effort is left to moderator discretion.

So like most people, I'll stick to fanfiction for the mean time.

But if you are hoping that you can submit to the BBC easily, then I must draw your attention to:

&gt;Please note: This is an archive page. The BBC Books range no longer selects unsolicited manuscripts.

Basically that means you need an agent. 

And since the page is kind of old, a lot of the information might no longer be accurate. For instance, I don't think any books about past Doctor as are currently being published, you won't be able to use any past companion or create a new one, or use any important past enemies, and I doubt you'll be able to create any sort of ongoing story line in the books.

27' have we always done that rotating corner routine, if we have this is the first I've noticed it. If not, then that's fucking genius. If we are playing a team that is zonal marking we will ALWAYS have a man free.

Whilst it was mainly kids, some of the passing and movement of the Chelsea midfield in the first half was superb and will stand the team in good stead going into the new season. In addition to this, I thought Kenedy had a very solid debut and it'd be nice to see how he develops at Vitesse or wherever if this transfer goes through. In contrast, Costa's finishing has been rather lacklustre throughout preseason. Nothing to be too concerned about though as his movement was excellent and generally so was his decision making, and it's understandable as all strikers go through patches of form like this. 

Second half was a little bit sloppy as changes seemed to loosen Chelsea's foothold on the game. I thought Mikel performed his task extremely well: receiving possession under pressure and moving it along smartly. Noticed at one stage Chelsea had four central defenders as a back four, with Zouma as LB. Is it possible that Mourinho is testing Zouma in that position as possible protégé for Ivanonic? A powerful fullback that can attack but then also act as a third central defender at corners? Pleasantly surprised with Chalobah too.

KdB played a lot on the wing last year, and can play the same and affect the game. We've also seen in MP's system this preseason, that the attacking mids are incredibly fluid. He will drift, shift, and find space across all parts of the field.


*2) Improve the midfield instead.*

I agree. But for 45-60m, who will actually come that can unseat Dinho/Yaya? Wilshere, maybe. Schneiderlin maybe could have. Witsel an option surely, but I think that could happen alongside KdB.

*3) Doesn't track back*

I don't think that's necessarily true. Also, MP's system would not require that at all out of him - at least nowhere near the intensity of Mourinho's Chelsea which caused his original transfer.

*4) Takes away from youth.*

This isn't true at all. The only first-team-ready AM City have is Lopes, and he is still only 19. It's well assumed that within 2-3 years, City will have moved on from Nasri, Navas, and probably Silva. With KdB, Lopes becomes the sixth choice AM which still puts him in City's second starting XI, playing in cup matches and filling in for injured players. If Lopes is going to make his mark, he'll need to take advantage of his opportunities and prove he deserves a seat on the bench before ever getting in the first XI. KdB, on the other hand, has already proved that worth.",null,0,null,1438139801,null,0,false,0,ctjuf05,null,t3_3eyr1q,null,t1_ctjuf05,null,t3_3eyr1q,null,null,null,1440149146,null,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3,null

We let some players go after loan spells like Guidetti, Richards, and Negredo. So far we have signed Raheem Sterling from Liverpool who is off to a great start, scoring 3 goals in 3 games, Fabian Delph from Aston Villa who debuted in a friendly against Real Madrid (which we lost 4-1) but had to be subbed off around 18 minutes in due to injury, and Enes Ünal from Bursaspor, who will most likely be loaned out, as he is only 18. Our biggest transfer target is Kevin De Bruyne, who we should expect to see in sky blue pretty soon.

null,false,Andtheyrustledsoftly,logo,,null,"Our squad is old. The oldest in last years CL knockout rounds to be exact. This means that our signings this summer have and likely will continue to all be youth. We also have several young talents we will try to integrate. 

We'll be looking to improve on our CL performances. The last two times we've advanced to the knockout stages, we've been defeated by Barca. While this is nothing to be ashamed of, we'll be looking to improve on those performances this year (and hopefully get a better draw). 

In the league, we at times looked like the best team in the PL. At our peak we played incredible, but in the middle of the season, we had a severe drop in form and fell out of the title race with Chelsea after being even on points with them at New Years. We'll obviously be looking to compete, and I think the general hope, and perhaps, expectation, is another title. 

In terms of transfers, we've purchased Raheem Sterling, Fabian Delph, Patrick Roberts, and Enes Unal. I assume you know who Raheem Sterling is. Fabian Delph will be a decent supporting member of the squad who can put in a decent shift if he needs to. Roberts is a promising English winger who will likely go on loan, and Unal is a promising striker who will likely do the same.

Lastly, a big hope is that youth is integrated in the squad. Currently, it looks as if there are 3, perhaps 4 U21's that might make the senior squad. The first, and in my opinion, the most promising is a young Belgian defender, Jason Denayer. He isn't insanely physical, but he's definitely strong and quick enough, and is generally in great position and handy on the ball. Next is Marcos Lopes. A Portuguese creative mid that many think could be a somewhat successor to Silva. He loves the club and the club seems to love him, but if he doesn't get time with the senior squad, it's possible he'll leave. Lastly, the promising striker Kelechi Iheanacho. He is both impressive physically and technically. I'm not sure who to compare him to, but he has shown great Chemistry with David Silva and Raheem in limited time, and looks very promising.

I'm sorry if this is a bit long, you might know some of this and some of it may be subject to opinion, but Im really excited about the upcoming season and liked doing this write up.
