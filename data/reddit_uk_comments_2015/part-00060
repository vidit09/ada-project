null,false,WArch,null,null,null,"Here are two things that 95%+ economists would agree with.

* Deficit spending will stimulate the economy and decrease unemployment through using up spare capacity which will also reduce the deficit

* Deficit spending whilst there is no spare capacity in the economy will cause the economy to overheat and cause a big recession. Deficit spending and stimulus can't reduce the structural deficit because it is how big the deficit would be if all spare capacity has already been used up

So the objective of cutting the deficit is to cut the structural deficit to being roughly balanced by the time all of the spare capacity is used up. Spending cuts will be contractionary, but the structural deficit still needs to be cut. It isn't the same as a household budget so there needn't be a surplus every year but it's still good to be roughly balanced over the business cycle.

Currently, spare capacity in the economy is less than 1% of GDP and the structural deficit is still around 5%. 

Labour's plan is to slow the pace of spending cuts. It probably won't be enough to overheat the economy (the SNP's might though). However, it will mean that debt will peak at a higher level than the Conservative plan. They also plan for it to be more tax rises. They're basically trying to make it the least spending cuts possible but are constrained by reality.

Another thing to consider is that the amount we're spending on interest has been surprisingly restrained considering the size of the deficit because bond yields dropped in 2008 though as the average bond maturity in the UK is 10 years it would be wise to cut the deficit by 2018/19.

Labour's plan wouldn't destroy the economy but it also seems to be a lot more about winning votes than wise economic management. I don't see how the Tory plans are possible though. I'd say we need roughly the Tory deficit objective (maybe a billion or two less) but probably split more evenly between (temporary) tax rises and spending cuts (e.g not raising the personal allowance so quickly and not raising the higher rate limit).",null,0,null,1424013091,null,0,1424014259,0,com4wel,null,t3_2vyr6f,null,t1_com4wel,null,t3_2vyr6f,null,null,null,1424603711,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Sorry mate, you're nice and all and you probably don't realise how much you piss me off when you irrationally diss the Villa or my local team Sydney FC, but you're honestly clueless.

I am the first to admit that the Villa have been terrible this season. But don't get all up on your high horse about your team who you have been following for all of 6 months. Not so long ago Villa were up with the front runners, but no one seems to remember that.

Just because the team you support for no reason apart from their recent form in the epl got knocked out doesn't mean it's a useless competition only for shit teams. If you had half an idea what you were talking about you would realise that Villa are a good batch of players who have been drastically underperforming, not a shit bunch of players who are playing at their best. 

Real football isn't like FIFA. Stop throwing those fucking player ratings at me and fucking sit down and watch some real football.

Have some respect for people who truly love their club, instead of just following along a bit every week watching highlights. 

There's a difference between a fan of football and a fan of a football team I reckon. Even if they say they love a team, it's easy for us diehards to see whether they truly love their team or if they're just there because everybody else has picked sides and they need to do so to fit in.

Having extra width isn't really much of a problem - when they're closed it'll just mean they're a bit more gathered at the top than you'd expect and they won't open *quite* so wide, but if you're using tie backs you won't notice that anyway. Given that you're using poles you could always fold the outside edge inwards so that the first hole is inside the second one, which should remove the extra width.

The extra length on the window one is fine and should allow for shrinkage. The extra length on the door curtains may be slightly more of an issue, but if you're **really** bothered you can always hem them. Which is tedious if you do it yourself, more expensive if you pay someone, but still way cheaper than getting the entire things done made to measure.

TBH unless you have really particular tastes on curtains, I'd say made to measure is the way to go, and it gives you FAR more options on places to shop.

Folks seem unaware even if the constraint of the magna carta, after which, even the king couldn't go against his own laws.

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; Interest at present eats up 3% of GDP and close to 8% of all spending, to keep that going we would need to spur growth faster than that no?

As long as the return on investing in the economy now pays off more than the low interest rates it costs the government to borrow, it will be worth it. On the flip side, [austerity decreases growth](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/05/george-osborne-2010-spending-cuts-shrank-uk-gdp-5-percent) which causes our interest payments to rise as a percentage of GDP.

&gt; Ok so say we stop all austerity tonight. How long will it takes us to grown out of debt, or even down to say a sustainable level, say 20%?

It's going to take decades to significantly reduce the debt to GDP ratio regardless, the question is whether we focus on growth now which reduces the debt to GDP ratio and makes it easier to pay back in the long term, or we focus on austerity now which holds back the economy. 

&gt; Bearing in mind we would be adding around £115Bn a year.

The deficit is currently £96 billion I believe.

&gt; Is it even possible before debt service costs eat up all budget revenues or causes bonds to leap?

As I said elsewhere Japan is coping with their debt to GDP ratio which is over 240% - An extra £170 billion of borrowing is 6.3% of current GDP, it's not un-affordable.",null,0,null,1424015359,null,0,1424015564,0,com5q4f,null,t3_2vyr6f,null,t1_com5q4f,null,t1_com4v66,null,null,null,1424604096,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"I guess my thought is he should have gained that experience elsewhere first as I don't really see Liverpool as a destination where learning the trade is a good idea for a manager.  I think he might have been better off staying at Swansea for a few more years to learn the management side of the game a bit more, or he should be willing to work with a DoF (which he would have to do at near every other club I can think of in the Deloitte top 10).

Why I think specifically a DoF would help is someone needs to coordinate all of the Academy sides and the first team, someone needs to be overseeing transfers in/out that isn't a committee, and someone needs to be more tightly tied into the overall structure of the club.  Inglethorpe's promotion may help with the first item, though, as he seems a bit more clear on what his desired outcome is for the younger players.  The transfer committee has been a debacle for me and needs to be replaced.  For the third, Liverpool FC employs over 500 people with revenues over £200M per year.  

It's a big business (orders of magnitude above where Rodger's previous clubs were) and a very complex one.  Right now I just think it's missing a bit of experienced supervision and there is a reason almost all clubs have a DoF, including City, Chelsea, Barca, etc.- it allows the first team manager to focus on what he should be, which is the first team.  Right now Rodgers is sort of playing the role of DoF and first team manager and given how hands-on is he in training it leaves very little time for anyone, much less a fairly inexperienced person, to do all of the more DoF aspects of the job.  If he were more like say Ferguson who basically let his coaches run training sessions, then it might work but frankly I just think he's doing the job of two people and that isn't fair to him or the club.",null,0,null,1424016726,null,0,false,0,com6ac6,null,t3_2vxvfg,null,t1_com6ac6,null,t1_com0mnk,null,null,null,1424604358,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; You soon come to realise that the very purpose of forming a corporation is pretty much to take a large business into the realms of avoiding paying as much tax as possible.

You're being sold a particular narrative that is at best only partly true.  If you don't question it you not only buy an inaccurate view of the world, but also you're led away from looking at other avenues.  The, ""very purpose of forming a corporation"" is to limit their liability to potential losses.

It's true that some people incorporate their businesses because they can claim more generous expenses in calculating their liability to tax.  This isn't, however, something important enough to get your panties in a twist over.  It'd be like looking at plumber who doesn't declare a few thousand pounds and blaming him for everything, instead of the people avoiding and evading tax on millions.

You can avoid or evade tax as an individual, or using partnerships.  In fact, all the film schemes you've no doubt heard about operate through partnerships.  The Icebreaker scheme Gary Barlow famously invested in also operated through a partnership.  *(To be clear, both were LLPs, which are in effect hybrids between companies and partnerships.)*

It's good to learn more, but you should appreciate that the author of that book is an employee of the Tax Justice Network.  This means he makes his living by shouting to a crowd that already agrees with him, ""Tax avoiders are bad, M'kay!""  It's much the same way that Richard Dawkins' career has become telling aggressive atheists, ""Religious people are dumb!""

null,false,DrSecretan,null,null,null,"I'm a big fan of Nationwide, and I'm surprised it always seems to be overlooked in articles and discussions about ""ethical banking"". 

As it's a building society, 75% of its business assets must be based on lending secured to property. You won't find Nationwide funding the likes of tar sands, animal testing or hippy quackery because the majority of its lending goes into property. Presumably personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards make up the bulk of the rest of their lending. If you're interested in ethical finance, its co-operative ownership structure might also be appealing.

I've found their customer service to be excellent. MoneySavingExpert's admittedly not very scientific poll found that its users ranked it #4 for service: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/bank-accounts/11058538/Rated-the-best-and-worst-banks-this-year-for-customer-service.html

Its products are pretty good too. The FlexDirect account offers 5% for the first year, dropping to 1% thereafter, and its Select Credit Card gives 0.5% cashback on all GBP spending. I've just had a quick look at its competitors' websites and it seems Nationwide's lending rates are generally a little better too.

I find their internet banking pretty good. I've used most banks' online offerings and I find Nationwide's to be quite a bit better than RBS, TSB, First Direct and The Co-Op, and to be about on-par with Santander's. Their mobile banking is also quite nice - it's regularly updated with new features and it works well. They've also got an Android Wear app which will display basic information about your accounts.

The one issue you might have is that they don't offer business accounts outside of a few business savings offerings, which I don't imagine is what you're looking for. I've been looking around business accounts recently for my photography business, and The Co-Op seems to be the best value for what I'd need (and it has some ethical cred), although Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and TSB aren't much more expensive and might work better for you if you need branch access.",null,0,null,1424018733,null,0,false,0,com76kk,null,t3_2vivhc,null,t1_com76kk,null,t3_2vivhc,null,null,null,1424604816,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

&gt; I agree, there will never be an ""overnight United Ireland moment"", it would be gradual over a fairly long period. Makeshift constitutional arrangements would facilitate this process.
&gt; 
&gt; I really doubt there will ever be a Reverse Troubles; it took the Northern state 48 years to erupt in violence from it's inception. It was a one party gerrymandered state that habitually discriminated against it's minority. Even then there was no appetite among northern Nationalists for the IRA border campaign, which was abandoned in failure. A lesson could be learned there that national identity alone was not a catalyst for violence even when faced with such discrimination. The key change in all of this was demands for improvement in material conditions *within the NI state*, not a United Ireland, i.e Civil Rights. It is important to remember that these demands where not calling for a United Ireland but an end to discrimination in electoral representation, policing, employment and housing. It was the fact that the state reacted so violently to these reasonable demands that led to mass violence. 
&gt;

null,false,itz4mna,null,null,null,"This is the Yank system, the Imperial system is actually quite sensible. A gallon of water weighs ten pounds and takes ten BTU to raise by one degree. Force is measured in poundals which is the energy required to accelerate one pound at a rate of one foot per second squared. Essentially it's derived in the same way as the modern metric system except it uses quantities that actually relate to people (a yard is an average man's pace, a mile is how far you can walk in twenty minutes, a fluid ounce is how much an ounce of water takes up) unlike the metric system which was mandated by intellectuals and does not originate from actual use. All metric quantities were originally defined by the metre (a kilogramme is the weight of a cubic decimetre of water, a litre is a cubic decimetre...) which is a ten-millionth of the Paris Meridian. How practical.

The only real advantage of the metric system is the prefixes. Decimal units in general make less sense than ones based on twelfths and sixteenths, these divide far cleaner. A third of a foot is four inches, a third of a metre is 33.33333333 centimetres. Imperial quantities also work far better with our time measurements, it takes a car travelling at a common speed limit of 60mph a minute to cover a mile but 1.66666666 minutes to cover a kilometre at the equivalent speed of 100 km/h.

That is leaving the UK and peoples future to the markets. What if bond rates move upwards? Any cut to government spending will reduce GDP, not really an argument. \

&gt;It's going to take decades to significantly reduce the debt to GDP ratio regardless, the question is whether we focus on growth now which reduces the debt to GDP ratio and makes it easier to pay back in the long term, or we focus on austerity now which holds back the economy.


Not regardless, their is a clear difference. ""*A 1% surplus throughout the 2020s would reduce debt as a share of national income by 27 percentage points (ppts), a decade of budget balance would reduce it by 19ppts and a decade of current budget balance while maintaining investment spending would reduce it by 9ppts*"" [IFS 2015](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525). From an economic stand point the Labour plan is not the best option, it is being used to buy votes.


&gt;An extra £170 billion of borrowing is 6.3% of current GDP, it's not un-affordable.

What fucking planet are you on, or am I falling for Poe's Law?

£3.30 will buy you an entire chicken which will do about 6 meals if you are in active and use every part. Chicken is a loss leader and is extremely cheap. Furthermore plenty of people ""make do"" with a vegetarian (Mac and cheese is vegetarian) diet and not spend any money on meat, meat is an expensive form of calories - your comparison is not equivalent.

20quid for a carrot? What's it made from gold. Carrots are £0.75 a kilo. Peas are £1.50 a kilo. That's enough to make a lot of meals.

Throw in some potatoes, or whatever starch you want and you've got enough food for a lot of meals. Considerably more if you make a stew, pie or casserole.

An entire can of Macroni and Cheese only contains 350Kcal. If you are eating in place of a meat &amp; two veg type meal you should be loosing weight, rapidly, not gaining it.

Put this in perspective to the common adage ""one in 20 people have been sexually abused as a child"" and you see that this may be in fact just the surface of things.

This website should be treated with suspicion- why concentrate on Labour members? Not being anit-Tory but for genuinely non-political reasons the Conservative Party is far more likely to have a greater proportion of paedos/child abusers in its ranks.

Obviously we _were_ going to recover the question is whether we did it because of or in spite of Conservative economic policies.

&gt;If you actually cared you could look all over the world, particularly in America where blacks had it far worse than Catholics, for examples of peaceful movements that were successful.

But the vast, vast majority used violence. Very, very few minorities were able to achieve equality through peaceful protest. 

Would you say Mandela and the ANC had the right to use violence?

&gt;Actually it is. We can look back and say the violence was unnecessary. 

No it's not. There was never any indication that equality would be achieved; Civil rights protests resulted in a loss of rights, in the form of rights to freedom of expression and protest, not a gain. From the perspective of those people discrimination would only increase and it did.

&gt;i'd do my best to start a non-violent movement

Grand. The government bans your protests. Anyone who attends is brutally beaten and arrested by the RUC. Loyalists start murdering people associated with it as they believe its a republican movement. Your leaders are rounded up and interned for years without trial. The B-specials, under direct control of the government, harass and attack your family. Your movement fails.

That's what happened to the civil rights movement. I don't see why your movement would be any different. Your solution is to do something which was tried and failed. Thats ridiculous

In what respect? 


&gt;a country with an insane level of debt at present, has a strong economy even following a global crisis - and you still don't think Labours plan will work?

The question is do we want to be Japan. To that I must answer no, no I do not want to help push my country into an unsustainable debt burden that will take decades to pay down. The problem for me is that another crisis or recession may strike and having such high debt will leave us vulnerable and unable to support new stimulus of investment measures. There is a reason that a 40% debt load is considered the limit. 

&gt;Both parties are taking us in the same direction (Lower levels of debt) the only difference being one of them is doing it through a slightly more rational approach of not decimating public services and the welfare state.

Correct, one much faster than the other. The big question is, should we aim to get down asap or relax at the risk of future problems. My other big issues is Labour in general,  they know the risks and know a surplus is really needed for longer term security, so they are using their plan and a short term boost of funding over the next parliament to get reelected in 2020.

However, if you think the prime minister *supervises* parliament in making laws the way a senior brick-layer might supervise his team in the building of a wall, that is, by telling them all what to do and making sure they do it, then you have a brick for a brain and obviously need more help. 

The office of the prime minister promulgates new laws for parliament to consider in the hope they will pass in the commons, since his party holds most likely a majority in the house of commons, though the current one's doesn't. 

If that's what you mean by ""supervise"" then your English vocabulary needs a little brushing up before you can be considered fluent. 

And if you think David Cameron was making laws in 1986, then your brain may in fact be more like a breeze block, replete with holes. 

Even if he was, he would still be constrained to obey them now so I don't know what your point is. 

The main function of the prime minister is executive rather than legislative. As he said, the job of government is to apply the laws, not to tell people what they can say. And even if the law said we all have to shut our mouths and cover them with duct tape, that would still be true and the problem would be the absurd Duct Tape Act 2099, not the prime minister or the executive branch of government, though you could certainly point out that what he is saying is inconsistent with existing statutes, as I and others have done elsewhere on the thread. But the problem would still be those statutes.

That's not the question you asked though. You asked how would you have done it without resorting to violence. Furthermore I don't think you want to change your own mind I think all you want to do is try and convince other people that it was necessary. 

&gt;But the vast, vast majority used violence.

[That's just not true, at all. There was some violence but it did more harm than good. In America the main change was brought about by peaceful protests.](But the vast, vast majority used violence.)

&gt;Would you say Mandela and the ANC had the right to use violence?

Oh you've gotta love the comparisons of Catholics and the IRA to Mandela and the ANC. The conditions they faced were incomparable and again, it was peace that brought change in the end. 

&gt;There was never any indication that equality would be achieved

Again you're looking at it from the POV of people at the time, and frankly ignorant ones at that, i'm telling you to look into the peaceful protests of MLK and Ghandi and the progress they made in their countries and then compare that to the IRA putting bombs outside schools and killing innocents. There's a reason that the IRA have left such an awful stain on this country and they are one of the reasons that we haven't moved on. 

Are you really suggesting that absolutely nothing would have changed and we would be in the same position now as we were in the 60s/70s without the violence?

&gt;The government bans your protests. Anyone who attends is brutally beaten and arrested by the RUC. Loyalists start murdering people associated with it as they believe its a republican movement. Your leaders are rounded up and interned for years without trial. The B-specials, under direct control of the government, harass and attack your family.

Do it anyway. Cease all work, have sitins, boycotts...you know all the peaceful protests that have been proven to work rather than cowardly attacks on innocent people.

&gt;Your movement fails.

Just like NICRA...oh no wait that was mostly due to the increasing influence the IRA had on them...

&gt;I don't see why your movement would be any different.

Maybe it wouldn't be, we can't really know because the IRA forced themselves on anyone who tried if they weren't scared off before that. Peaceful movements had no support from either side until much later but it was the peaceful attempts at ending the conflict that ultimately succeeded. That's why I think they would have worked, peaceful groups have been shown to work all over the world in the face of much greater adversity, why not here?

You have a very one-sided view of the conflict and that's why I don't think you're actually going to let anyone try and convince you otherwise. You have this view of the IRA, and I imagine a large part comes form family who were involves, and you won't let yourself see them as unnecessary or even evil in some of their actions.",null,0,null,1424025604,null,0,false,0,comaj7w,null,t3_2vxh7x,null,t1_comaj7w,null,t1_com9z9u,null,null,null,1424606379,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

But WHY did Labour, in particular, let ""people"" (under-age girls) down? Because of its politics. Because Muslims are a minority, mostly poorer, and most importantly, mostly of darker colour than most of the population. That is why many of them have been able to get away with raping girls in areas like Rotherham - because political correctness made it harder for the authorities to investigate. 

Sent people who noticed the Muslim connection on diversity courses, persuaded Channel Four not to show a documentary, argued for bans on protestors against the Muslim gangs, physically attacked the protestors, and called them ""fascists"". They also physically prevented UKIP from speaking out against the gangs, and, while allowing Muslims to rape white children, took a couple of minority children away from UKIP-sympathising foster parents.

It's because Labour follows Ed Miliband's politics that it ""let people down"".

 [**Tennents' Sixes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennents%27%20Sixes): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Tennents' Sixes__ was an annual [indoor football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_soccer) tournament contested each January by senior football clubs from Scotland (along with some English guests) between 1984 and 1993. The tournament was sponsored by [Tennent Caledonian Breweries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennents) and organised by the [Scottish Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association). When Tennent Caledonian Breweries withdrew their sponsorship after the 1993 event, the Sixes was discontinued. 

&gt;The format used was dependent on the number of teams participating: in most cases 10 teams were involved and would be drawn into 2 groups of 5 who would play each other once. From there, the first and second-placed teams from each group would contest the knockout stages, consisting of two semi-finals and a final.

That being said, I believe dzeko should have been favored over jovetic and that the manager made the right decision, albeit a very difficult one to make.

But it all may be moot anyhow-- remember this is a two-legged affair against a team who is on fire at the moment (just watched barca demolish yet another team). Jovetic may not even have played had he been in the squad--odds are, dzeko won't see hardly any minutes either. 

The decision is more symbolic and signifies how far down the pecking order jovetic is in pellegrini's eyes.

Should he leave in the summer, I don't necessarily think another striker is what we need. I'd like to look for more creative midfield players to rejuvenate the squad, and perhaps a proper winger and wingback as well.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"Fair question.  Mostly it's just down to time.  Rodgers is very much hands on on the training pitch, which is a good thing as he's quite good at that sort of thing.  Let's say it takes up a good chunk of his day, from pre-planning to execution to dealing with various first team issues (chatting with the players, watching opposition tapes, reviewing the previous games, etc.).  On top of that, he's also trying to deal with potential incoming players, outgoing players, evaluating prospects, trying to understand where the youth players are at in progression and how they might fit in, dealing with the media, worrying about scheduling of things like friendlies, providing feedback on travel plans, etc, etc.  

It's an awful lot for any one person to deal with effectively and, in modern football, I just don't think it's even feasible.  He needs to either offload some of the coaching to his coaching staff (which I don't think would be a good idea as it's one of his strengths) like say Ferguson did, or let someone else deal with the providing a blueprint to the Academy, handling scouting and recruitment of players and other items indirectly related to the first team.

Short version is his primary responsibility should be to the existing first team and first team only and someone like a DoF or Technical Director or whatever you want to call them would allow him to be 100% focused on that task rather than dealing in a broader aspect with all footballing activities across the club which is to some extent what he's trying to do right now.  

To answer your question specifically, I think the current setup has led to problematic transfers, an inefficient and near unworkable transfer committee concept, loads of loans that make little sense for us or the players and are not very strategic, players being left out on loan with little guidance or contact from the club, and a very inefficient use of our own top Academy players.  I believe a DoF would sort most of these problems and I don't see any of them improving in the future without changes being made, although to be fair some changes have already been made (Inglethorpe accepting a new position in November, as an example, or on the other side of the business Hogan and the new London office).",null,0,null,1424026791,null,0,1424027081,0,comb51l,null,t3_2vxvfg,null,t1_comb51l,null,t1_comangb,null,null,null,1424606662,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

The answer is yes. Japan is used as an extreme example to show you have to go pretty fucking far for the level of debt to become a grave concern.

Since both parties are bringing the level of debt down, the semantics of Japanese economics is completely irrelevant because for that to be a mitigating factor, one of the parties would be raising the level of debt.

Since both are bringing the level of debt down, the question then becomes one of necessity.

&gt;No it's not.    

Labour's plans present that as a potential outcome       

Japan is an example of a debt trap, they didn't intend to get there but they didn't have much of a choice, as I have mentioned.[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njp8bKpi-vg)

Labour's debt reduction plan assumes growth. Now in the short term we already have Europe our largest trading partner in depression, longer term we have what appears to be China's slow down and let's hope its a slow down, not a crash. What if the economy doesn't grow? Or doesn't grow by much like most of Europe? Or another global crisis occurs like the ones each decade is marked with, could we cope with another slow down. Now the IFS predicts Labour will reduce the debt load by 9% by 2030, thats all and that to not take into consideration any unforeseen bumps on the road. 

&gt;Now you could arguably say that putting a million people dependent on food banks and driving down wages to protect ourselves from future crises is a necessity, I would say that's just idiotic.

And I would say that you are being short sighted and risking 60 Million peoples future prosperity.

null,false,shrister,null,null,null,"&gt;For most people, the image of a mansion is probably a home somewhere out in the country with about a dozen rooms, and perhaps a pool and tennis court at the side. A lot of people would therefore quite like the idea of these types of houses getting taxed, but in fact it will turn out to be an economic disaster for this country.


This tax only effects literally the most expensive area for property in the world, or enormous houses in other areas. I remember when mylene klass brought up this old chesnut- turns out she just bought a £3m property in London 7 bedroom 4 bath! Mansion! In London! Surprise surprise. 

&gt;This is because the mansion tax will yield very little revenue for the government, perhaps £1b, which is basically a rounding error, giving the size of the budget deficit.


There are literally dozens of head line policies which would yield less. You know if you say a BILLION pounds is not much that doesn't actually make it true.  


&gt;France has got its own version of the mansion tax, and the result has been catastrophic, thousands upon thousands of people have left the country, taking their money and businesses with them. 

Funny to make this claim and then back it up with nothing. Nothing. You say something this stupid and then don't back it up? You know, ""This exact thing has happened, here, we can tell exactly what will happen, but I'm just going to continue stating my opinion rather than actually give you any facts"". 


&gt;the mansion tax will instead be based on where they happen to live and which property they might have purchased a few decades back.


Right, except its only levied at sale for people whose salaries are under a certain level. 


&gt; pensioners who are living in a property which they purchased in their working lives and which is now valued at £2m will be placed in the same bracket as those who are still regularly earning large amounts of money.


People who lucked into huge unearned  windfalls? My heart bleeds. Remember, only taxed when the asset is liquidated.


&gt;There isn’t currently an efficient system of taxing property in Britain, however the mansion tax is most certainly not right policy to implement.

Right, but it's better than doing nothing. 


&gt;“What we need is what I think the Liberal Democrats are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system. That’s what I would like to see.”


A tax with no relation to property prices and with no relation to property ownership. 


&gt;short-term mansion tax”.

You can't just throw bullshit in like ""short-term"" and pretend its true, if anything the mansion tax is a much longer term solution, because its offsetting the tax for low income areas. 

&gt;Private property ought to be just that; somebody’s property.


Right, so if that's your objection stop bullshitting. If that's what you think, say it rather than try and convince us blue is green, up is down and £1bn is pocket change. But actually, it's a bullshit excuse, you could say the same about investments - capital gains, or wages - that's my money and it ought to be just that.

&gt;Oh you've gotta love the comparisons of Catholics and the IRA to Mandela and the ANC. The conditions they faced were incomparable and again, it was peace that brought change in the end.

First, you didn't answer. Peaceful protest achieved absolute sweet fuck all in South Africa. The campaign of civil disobedience last 50 years. 50 fucking years and the only thing that happened was that the Apartheid regime increased its power and subjected the black and coloured people to increased levels of brutality and control. In the end it was international pressure that forced the government to strike a deal.

Second, don't trivialize the conditions that Catholics were living in in Northern Ireland. 

Third, I *did not* make any comparison. I asked you that as I wondered whether you thought violence was acceptable in any situation.

Fourth, don't criticise me for making comparisons (even though I didnt) whilst your banging on about Ghandi and MLK. How is Ghandi relevant in any way whatsoever? 

&gt;Again you're looking at it from the POV of people at the time,

Of course I am. I am absolutely baffled at why you think its appropriate to do anything but this. What good is it being captain hindsight? Nobody at the time knew Europe was going to become this liberal democracy where everyone is equal; For all they knew discrimination would increase over time. It explains why many people moved to violence. 

&gt;Are you really suggesting that absolutely nothing would have changed and we would be in the same position now as we were in the 60s/70s without the violence?

No, I'm saying that at the time calls for civil rights only resulted in increased discrimination. There was no indication that the civil rights movement would work. I've explained that more than once.

You just keep saying the same thing; '*Do it anyway'*. You don't even acknowledge that civil rights protests resulted in bloodshed. Leaders were beaten up, killed or interned. Things were getting worse not better. Peaceful protest was violently and successfully repressed by the state. Why should they have to sit back and take that? Why do you believe citizens don't have a right to fight back when they are being murdered by the state?



&gt;peaceful groups have been shown to work all over the world in the face of much greater adversity, why not here?

Really? The American civil rights movement, who else? And none of this Ghandi crap, that was a fight for independence. Violent resistance is much, much, much more common but you refuse to acknowledge this. 

Also, I believe the ACRM had every right to use violence had the government not bowed to their demands. The government was already assassinating certain leaders.  


&gt;You have this view of the IRA, and I imagine a large part comes form family who were

But I don't think the situation is as clear cut as you make it out to be where Rodgers is seemingly swamped on all sides. Going into this situation he and the club knew the responsibilities involved and Rodgers himself refused a DoF--I don't think that's because he is too proud, but that a DoF doesn't work with how Rodgers envisions the club working. Personally I don't know the inner workings of the club. I don't know if Rodgers really is swamped how you describe it, or if the truth is that he delegates well and is able to bring a single unified vision to various facets of the club. Honestly we don't even fully know how this transfer committee fully works, considering the amount of conflicting news we have received and the amount of rumors floating about regarding the committee. AFAIK the committee was FSG's way of trying to prevent the wanton spending they saw under Kenny. 

I don't think we can accurately call the committee unworkable or a disaster either, considering a good amount of the clubs transfers have started to work out and click well. The committee showed good ability early on to snag Sturridge and Coutinho, and while not every transfer will be a success it's starting to look like they have built a promising and young base for the club to grow from. 

The loans I see more as a symptom of modern football. That's just how the sport is evolving. And while something like loaning Aspas doesn't make too much sense, other loans like bringing in Manquillo seem smart. And loans are lower risk than transfers. Plus a manager can just as easily have a system for checking in on players on loan, no different from how a DoF would handle it. 

Like I said I understand your argument when you lay out Rodgers's responsibilities and we put ourselves in his shoes. But then again just because I don't see how I could juggle xyz doesn't mean it's not doable. So far nothing has happened to push me in favor of a DoF bc there hasn't been anything I've seen that seems to cry out for one.

It is a western myth that the Indian Independence Movement was entirely peaceful. There where multiple actors, groups and social forces involved in the Indian Independence Movement, Gandhi was only one Element.

&gt; In parallel to the mass mob violence of the Quit India Movement, a traditional military campaign was being fought by Indian nationalists.  From 1942 to 1945, the Indian National Army (INA)–a group of armed militants whose members consisted of recently freed Indian POWs and Indian expatriates living in South-East Asia–was engaged in guerilla warfare against the British, and steadily pushing its way toward India. [Source](https://kurukshetra1.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/no-non-violence-didnt-free-india-from-the-british-empire/)

Even the [""Quit India Movement""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit_India_Movement), endorsed by Gandhi employed violent tactics.

&gt; The Quit India movement, launched in 1942 by Gandhi and other Congress leaders, is perhaps the best example of the successful use of violence in the Indian Independence Movement–notably because it was endorsed by Gandhi himself.  The movement saw widespread insurrectionary acts across India, with the participation of millions of common people.

The Civil Rights Movement in America did have an Impact here it had a significant influence over a group who had tried and failed at violent insurrection, the IRA. The IRA actually created the NICRA. 

I posted this months back it is carefully sourced, i will put forward the argument that the the Civil Rights movement and the NICRA was the product of the IRA, symptomatic of their changing focus of the time.

--------------------------------------------
Those tumultous times have been re-interpreted, revisited and rehashed multiple times all in the service of revisionism; i.e to serve today's political agenda. There will of course be people involved in the NICRA who have vastly different opinions about the nature of the movement. There are those with their own agenda and that includes the current Sinn Fein, but to deny their involvement and more so their importance is an absolute absurdity. It is quite clear from documented evidence that the IRA had undergone a massive change after its failed border campaign. It had a lot of internal discussions and debate, theses debates led directly to the formation of the The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement (NICRA)

&gt; The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Irish: Cumann Chearta Sibhialta Thuaisceart Éireann) was an organisation which campaigned for civil rights in Northern Ireland during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Formed in Belfast on 9 April 1967, the civil rights campaign attempted to achieve reform by publicising, documenting, and lobbying for an end to abuses in areas such as housing, unfair electoral procedures, discrimination in employment and the Special Powers Act. **The genesis of the organisation lay in a meeting in Maghera in August 1966 between the Wolfe Tone Societies which was attended by Cathal Goulding, then chief of staff of the IRA.** The hope of the IRA, which four years earlier had ceased military operations after the failure of its Border Campaign, was that out of the already-nascent civil rights movement in Northern Ireland begun in 1963-4 by the Homeless Citizens' League and the Campaign for Social Justice there would arise a campaign of civil disturbance which would assist its efforts to unseat the unionist government in Belfast, and that the creation of NICRA would enable it to direct that campaign's course. Although socialist republicans and one IRA member were among those involved in the creation of NICRA, the IRA did not direct it.^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association)

For further information about the initial meeting of the NICRA in Maghera;

&gt; NICRA itself originated at a conference of the Wolfe Tone Societies held in Maghera, County Derry, on the weekend of 13-14 August 1966. The societies had been created in 1964 out of the committees which were set up to organise the 1963 commemorations of the bicentenary of the birth of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen and martyr of the 1798 Rising. Their 'primary objective was a united, independent and democratic Irish Republic in accordance with the principles of the 1916 Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil'. Fred Heatley described them as 'an autonomous adjunct of the Republican Movement', and Roy Johnston called them 'a Fabian Society to the Republican Movement'.

&gt; The republicans were active in influencing the direction taken by NICRA as well as in its creation. Goulding himself was present at the Wolfe Tone Societies meeting in Maghera in 1966. To understand the significance of their involvement, however, and the direction in which republican influence took the civil rights movement, it is necessary to examine carefully the political strategy of the republicans in the mid-1960s. The abandonment of the 1956-62 IRA military campaign was highly ambiguous and from outward appearances it was possible to interpret republican actions as either preparation for a renewed onslaught or as a delicate operation to keep the movement together while its direction was fundamentally changed.
&gt; 
**Politics in the Streets:The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland by Bob Purdie (1990)** ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie.htm)

The IRA strategy was to mobilize people around social issues, but steered clear of directly controlling organisations it had helped create. Nobody said the NICRA had a military wing, that is precisely the point, peaceful demonstrations where met with the full force of the state. The Level of violence unleashed shocked even the IRA who were ill prepared for such an eventuality, in fact it split over what to do in response.

The NICRA was a broad movement that had Moderate Unionists, Anarchists, Socialists and Republicans, it held the hopes of many for a better and more just society. It was a the reaction of the state who sought to smash the movement. It brutalised and slaughtered a peaceful movement over very reasonable demands. The actions of the IRA Leadership are clear, they had tried a futile armed campaign previously, it had no support and they wound it up. Their actions subsequently were to campaign in a peaceable manner in a broadbased coalition for positive change. They had not forseen the disproportionate response that the state would mete out, the Republican movement split over how to deal with the actions of the state. At the time Catholic areas were daubed with the slogan ["" I R A= I RAN AWAY""](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oVaUkHKOyLAC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=%22I+R+A%3D+I+RAN+AWAY%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L43qTZUV3f&amp;sig=sA0E69mRJSe9H169N1GTDoIZXAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bJA2VPOoOMGa7gar84HoBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20R%20A%3D%20I%20RAN%20AWAY%22&amp;f=false), they where sneered at for their inaction. It was the demand from the Civil Rights generation that brought the PIRA to fruition, the Catholic population would no longer traipse home from a march beaten bruised and dejected while their friends and comrades lay in pools of blood in the street.

It was Bloody Sunday that led a vast bulk of people to leave join the newly formed PIRA. The swansong of the NICRA was a march directly after Bloody Sunday in which 100,000 people attended; it was the last thing they ever really did. 

&gt; Despite such attempts to continue civil disobedience, the civil-rights movement floundered during 1971 and 1972. In January 1972 British soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration, killing 13 civilians in what became known as ""Bloody Sunday"". NICRA organised a protest in response, in which over 100,000 people took part. This was, however, to be the organisation's last significant march; Bloody Sunday had “immobilised NICRA from returning to the streets”. As clashes escalated, London suspended the Northern Ireland parliament. This marked the end of the civil-rights movement and street politics. The Provisional IRA emerged as the dominant force within the movement, and Irish nationalism became the foremost political position for those seeking radical social change.


Here are some of the personal recollections of Peter Cosgrove (Peoples Democracy Member)
 
&gt;  The struggle for “Civil Rights” was intended to change this state of affairs.  The “Civil Rights” movement covered a multiplicity of Catholic nationalists, republicans, communists and ordinary decent human beings who actually believed in “Civil Rights”.
&gt; 
&gt; It seemed clear to me that trying to march from Belfast to Derry would cause problems for the Orange State.  So, I swaggered up Royal Avenue on 1 January, 1969.
&gt; We were a motley crew as we set off up Royal Avenue. Gery Lawless, Ireland’s best known Trotskyist had come over from London. So too had Bowes Egan, a writer and publisher.  Rita O’Hare, later to become a well-known republican was there.  So was Johnny Morrissey from Tipperary.  None of these folk were students. There were students on the march but they were probably outnumbered by graduates and people with no university background.
&gt; 
&gt; We were preceded by a posse of Unionists waving the Union Jack. They were led by Major Bunting who was, at the time, Dr Paisley’s right-hand man.  Oddly enough, the Major’s son, Ronnie who later became a prominent member of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) was on the march.

They also do a neat neoprene helmet cover, tail packs and hydrapaks.

The tailpacks I more often use as bolt ons to a backpack than on their own but they work for tailpacks too. (and tank bags with the optional extra tank adapter). All hard used, the waterproof R30 and US packs have been and remain waterproof even in extreme conditions, the R35 is not waterproof but is water resistant and combined with an optional waterproof inner liner has been a year round bag for me. The R35 is a bit grubby and some velcro looks a bit furry but you wouldn't believe it's done a decade plus of riding and probably 200k all weather miles

I have lived in the countryside all my life and ""the hunt"" as they are known often go around the area where I live.

When the hunting ban was first announced I was generally against it. It was partly the result of a Blairite, urban, ignorant view of the countryside. I resent it when ""townies"" try to dictate what the people of the countryside should do.

I've since changed my mind to strongly for a stronger hunting ban. Whilst I still agree with the latter half of what I wrote above, I've become increasingly disillusioned with the countryside's society. Also, you know, tearing apart foxes is awful. 

Yeah, sure, seeing them in their nice red outfits is quite nice. But the attitudes of those in the hunts is dreadful, search online for videos and you'll see what I mean. I am genuinely convinced that some of the people who participate in hunts have some sort of sadistic mental illness. Shooting something, sure, you can get some sort of pleasure out of that because it's usually painless for the animal (in contrast to how it would have naturally died) and you get food. But to get pleasure from the end result of hunting is concerning.

As an anecdote, the local hunt went out last year. They trampled through my neighbour's private property, including her horse paddock. The two horses (one very old) went berserk and (since they'd opened the gate) got loose. They ran for miles, the older one nearly died. Luckily they were recaptured but she was pretty furious, since she was away at the time and I had to try to find the horses for her.

I don't think I am, i'm just disagreeing with you. Didn't use bad language either. Not that I overly care but you're actually the one insulting people here and using derogatory language.

&gt;First, you didn't answer.

I did actually, I said that comparing the two is pointless as they are entirely different and I think that the political situations made different tactics necessary. Btw the end of this 50 year struggle was peaceful, that's how it was won and it's why Mandela is seen as a paragon of peace, most of his work was done in prison and after. Yes he used violence and perhaps that was required in a different climate, country and continent but similar tactics were wrong here imo. I think that's pretty widely agreed upon on a historical level, hence Mandela's Nobel Peace Prize for his work and the IRA's...nothing...

Although that does lead onto the brilliant work done by Mairead Maguire and Betty Williams with the Community for Peace People. As well as John Hume and David Trimble who did amazing work through peaceful methods.

&gt;Second, don't trivialize the conditions that Catholics were living in in Northern Ireland.

I absolutely am not. They are not even close to the situation in either America or South Africa. South Africa in particular was vastly different.

&gt;Third, I did not make any comparison.

Oh you did though. 

&gt;Fourth, don't criticise me for making comparisons (even though I didnt) whilst your banging on about Ghandi and MLK. How is Ghandi relevant in any way whatsoever?

I criticised a poor comparison and an uninformed one. Ghandi and MLK are relevant because they used the methods I am championing to great effect and attained their goals through them. You wanted to know how peaceful methods could achieve equality and i'm giving you examples that. They faced similar adversity and challenges and overcame them and gained world-renowned respect for it. 

&gt;What good is it being captain hindsight? 

You asked how would I have gone about gaining equality. I've answered and given evidence we now have available that it would have been successful. You go on and on about all the obstacles but I believe that due to what we know now peaceful methods would ultimately have been successful, if you're actually looking for discussion about it you can't dismiss that.

&gt;You don't even acknowledge that civil rights protests resulted in bloodshed.

I did actually. I think it was worth it.

&gt;Why do you believe citizens don't have a right to fight back when they are being murdered by the state?

I think everyone has that right, however, I do not believe in exercising that right when there is a better way.

&gt;The American civil rights movement, who else?

Recent or historical? There's the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong, Boycotting Russian goods in Ukraine, the Bahrain Uprising, recent Spanish protests and that's a small sample of the past couple of years.

Looking farther back you can see Tianneman Square, the Monday Protests, the Prague Spring, Draft resistance, the Non-Cooperation Movement. These were all somewhat successful at either gaining what was wanted or raising public awareness to astounding levels. Again, there's so many more example throughout history and none that i've given are even that old, just more well known. I even left out the 'Ghandi crap' because for some reason the most well-known and successful proponent of non-violent protest isn't allowed.


&gt;Violent resistance is much, much, much more common but you refuse to acknowledge this.

Seriously what? I'm not denying it happens, I don't know where you go that from, but there's a difference between it happening and violence being the only way for equality to be attained in NI.

I can see where you're coming from, but to be honest I don't really understand why Rodgers is so opposed to working with a DoF.  It's no secret he wants to manage one of Spain's big two someday and at either he would have to deal with one whether he liked it or not as he would at almost any other club bigger than Liverpool.  

Mourinho works with a Technical Director, Pellegrini with a DoF, Guardiola with a Sporting Director- if it's good enough for the likes of those 3, I don't see why it can't work with Rodgers outside of his insistence it isn't needed.  Conversely, it's hard to understand how near every other big club has such a position if it isn't needed either.  Combine that with what I see as a bit of lack of leadership across the club and to me it near screams out that such a position is something we need and the owners I think would prefer that as well but at the time Cruyff wasn't interested in taking the job (unfortunately, he would be near perfect).

I see the committee as a complete failure, although I can appreciate others having a differing opinion.  It isn't so much the players are bad players (although summer before last was a bit of a disaster) as much as it is I don't think they did a good job of identifying and bringing in players in positions where they were needed.  It's all a bit schizophrenic for me which is probably inevitable given the setup.

Our loan system needs a massive overhaul as for me it's been very poor.  The locations chosen aren't great and the players are largely left to fend for themselves.  Chelsea, as an example, have done a remarkably good job here, as loathe as I am to admit it.  They have a specific system setup with loanees being monitored by a local staff member, usually an ex-player (Moses and Lukaku for example had the same one when they were on loan in Liverpool) who usually meets with them at least weekly to see how things are going and provide feedback back into Chelsea.  Then they obviously have the relationship with Vitesse which I think is a good bit of business for them.  Agreed this could be perhaps fixed without a DoF, but I do think one would help as they would have the time to chase it down more than BR does.

&gt;You see there's more to ""the economy"" than who can slash spending the fastest, there's the question of who can get and keep people in jobs, who can get wages rising in real terms, who can get the economy as a whole growing fastest. 


I agree, it does have to be tempered with economic security though. You mention employment and wages, unemployed is down to [5.8%]( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/unemployment-rate) and wages are predicted to pick up this year. I don't know what else we could push for, the slack in the economy takes time to be reduced.

No, you attempt to be passive aggressive and patronising at every opportunity. I never said you did use bad language; I said you can argue like a prick without using it. 

I did not compare the situation in South Africa. I mean, my comment is right there for everyone to see. Literally right there. You just look like a fool by maintaining that.

Seriously how can you shout at me for apparently comparing N.I. to South Africa (which I didn't) then bring up terrible, terrible irrelevant examples like the boycotting of Russians goods in Ukraine and draft resistance? First of all, we're talking about achieving equality here not every situation where non-violent protest was ever used.

Second, examples such as Tianneman Square and the Bahrain protests are just examples of peaceful protest not working. They were both complete failures that resulted in the state murdering its own civilians to ***successfully*** destroy a protest movement. Peaceful protest resulted in state murder, bloodshed and failure here, just as the NICRA resulted in state murder, bloodshed and failure.

&gt;I even left out the 'Ghandi crap'

Ehhh, 'non-cooperation movement'.... lol did you just copy and paste that list from wikipedia or something without knowing what the the Non-Cooperation Movement was? haha

&gt; /u/thefaceofbobby[1]  [+11] who has stated that he was related to members of the IRA on this website before

That never, ever happened. 

This argument comes down to the fact that you think Catholics should have continued peaceful protests despite being subject to extreme violence from the state and loyalists. You think Catholics were under an obligation to take those bullets, batons and fists on the chin and keep on marching on their failed crusade. 

I believe that once the state  took away all legal, political and economic means to achieve equality, then subjected social attempts to bloodshed and murder the use of violence became legitimate. Why should they have to remain peaceful whilst being victims of state violence?

...then why mention bad language at all? Really weird...

&gt; I did not compare the situation in South Africa. 

You did though. You asked me to discuss the SA violence in the middle of a conversation about the IRA, it was quite clearly an attempt to draw some sort of correlation and now you're backtracking. But like you said i'm sure people can make up their own minds.

&gt;First of all, we're talking about achieving equality here not every situation where non-violent protest was ever used.

So there's no way that we could adopt similar tactics that were successful in other situations? Can you see how I came to the conclusion you aren't actually interested in discussion? You're just burying your head in the sand whenever anyone talks about non-violent movements. So far you've dismissed the black civil-rights movement, Ghandi and now at least 2 other movements. You've also ignored the examples i've given of successful peace movements in NI entirely. There's no point in having a discussion when you're ignoring everything people are saying to you.

&gt;examples such as Tianneman Square and the Bahrain protests are just examples of peaceful protest not working.

Again if you read my comment you'll note that I used them as examples of putting the situation on the world stage to the point that they'll likely never be forgotten (TS in particular). Another example of this that you might actually like since it involves the glorious IRA is the Hunger Strikes. They arguably did more for the IRA's goals than any other single action and it was completely non-violent and those men actually have the respect of many people who disagree with them politically. Now compare that to the reaction people have to say Bloody Friday.

&gt;the Non-Cooperation Movement

That'd be the process of Nationalists setting up their own government and policing etc. in the early 20's just prior to independence. I should have realised you wouldn't like that though since it was based largely on the similar movements that Ghandi used and inspired in South Africa.

&gt;That never, ever happened.

I'm pretty sure it did though. 

&gt;This argument comes down to the fact that you think Catholics should have continued peaceful protests despite being subject to extreme violence from the state and loyalists.

Yup the escalation that occurred on both sides helped nobody.

&gt;You think Catholics were under an obligation to take those bullets, batons and fists on the chin and keep on marching on their failed crusade.

...nope...I think they should have done as it would have resulted in a better and quicker outcome than the one we currently have. I've said that a couple of times and you can try and make me out to be some sort of anti-catholic monster all you like but like you yourself said the words are right there for people to read.

&gt;Why should they have to remain peaceful whilst being victims of state violence?

Pique has been one of the best defenders in the entire world since the New Year. And the rotation of Bravo/ter Stegen has proved to be an effective combo to consistently help Barcelona maintain clean sheets. Maybe not quite as good as Neuer, but damn effective in their own right.

The midfield is probably the most underrated part. Rakitic has been immense in the recent matches against Atletico. Notice how a ""World Cup champion"" midfield like Kroos was utterly shite against Atletico in the 4-0 drubbing of Real, but Rakitic and Iniesta were instrumental in Barcelona's 3 thrashings of them?

I've already explained this too. I asked in order to see if you are one of these people who says 'all violence is always wrong' so I could beteer undersatnd who I'm talking too. 

&gt;Can you see how I came to the conclusion you aren't actually interested in discussion

Listen, leave out the patronising. Seriously. Just because you haven't put forth a convincing argument to change my mind does not mean I'm 'not interested in discussion'. Stop it. 

&gt;So far you've dismissed the black civil-rights movement

Where exactly did I do this? Point it out please. That's just a straight up lie.

THE ACRM succeeded. The NICRM failed, which for some strange reason you refuse to accept. Thats all that matters here.

&gt;You've also ignored the examples i've given of successful peace movements in NI entirely. 

We are talking about the failure of the civil rights movement. You're trying to move the discussion on to irrelevant things such as the GFA. Why are you doing that? Why does it matter? The NICRA was a failure. That happened.

&gt;they'll likely never be forgotten

So what? Bloody Sunday, where 14 civil rights protesters were murdered by the state, won't be forgotten any time soon. Whats that got to do with anything? Bloody Sunday directly led to the failure of the NICRA. Stop trying to pretend these bloody useless failures were somehow victories for the people. That's some of the stupidest stuff I've ever read on reddit.

Lol since when was self-harm non-violent? Many of them died you know..... 

Again, totally utterly irrelevant. *We are talking about the civil rights movement in the early 70's. Not China, not America. The situation that was specific to here, which cannot be explained by discussing the ACRM or anyone else.*

&gt; non-cooperation movement

Quick little Google there, yeah? You blatantly said 'I left out the Ghandi stuff'. You didn't because you didn't know nor bother to check what the non-cooperation movement was.

&gt;think they should have done as it would have resulted in a better and quicker outcome

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"&gt;Your assuming the Tories would run a 1% surplus all through the 2020s, and Labour would continue to borrow to invest all through this period. This is pure speculation in both cases.

I am, not so much speculation as extrapolations on their current proposals, extrapolations made by experts on the matter not myself. The Tories have been far more clear on this, If Labour has an alternate plan, tax rises or less investment they need to state it. The reason I and we must consider these longer term extrapolations is that our public finances will be the central focus of policy for at least the next few parliaments.

&gt;We have 1.9 million unemployed, 3 million underemployed

It's a choice, we chose flexible labour markets, that has meant low unemployment but negative working and social implications. It's a hard choice to make as spiralling high unemployment also brings with it huge social issues, see southern Europe. 

&gt;Maybe this would be acceptable if the welfare state was functioning

That's what cuts lead to, what would you have done? Social spending is a large part of our budget.


&gt;Only the most dedicated Tory apologist could look at these disastrous record and decide everything was fine and nothing needed to change, and despite it seeming like you'd started this thread with an open mind, it's now clear that's exactly what you are.

Well things aren't fine, I don't think anybody is saying that. Recovery is not going to be a permanent state, it will change, but not yet, people seem to struggle in grasping this, our current state is not forever it is an uncomfortable blip, a 7 year blip I may add.

null,false,davegod,null,null,null,"Hmm, depends a bit on how flexible you are with where you want to stay, the standard you'll accept, and a bit of luck. The main issue is there are a lot of pretty crappy flats here IMHO. A lot of piss-taking where kitchens have been converted into bedrooms and kitchens installed into the living room and then they try to rent it as a flat with 1 more bed than it really should. Crappy furniture, old carpets, out of date kitchens &amp; bathrooms, that kind of thing. Very amateur landlords who get away with it because come October there's a huge influx of students and it's a seller's market. July/August is another time to avoid flat hunting, due to the festival. 

They generally expect you to move in about a months time, because usually the previous tenant has given their 1 month notice. If the flat is already vacant, they'll wait up to a month for you because they expect most people to have to give notice and they are generally keen to accept the first person who is willing to take the flat, rather than just hope someone comes along who can move in sooner. 

Some landlords are a bit more fussy when letting to foreigners, basically because they don't have much recourse if you trash the place and leave the country. Usually this just means being more pedantic about getting references and maybe a bigger deposit.

Which countries are you thinking of working? Where do you think you will retire? Where will you remain 'domiciled'? 

The government is currently in the process of requiring employers to contribute to an employees contribution. For most this is a minimum of 1% but will rise to 4% over the next few years. The plan is to increase this to 8% (combined by both you and your employer). So its better than the minimum, so I wouldn't be complaining. It really comes down to your field and the similar pension schemes offered by alternative employers to really judge how good your pension is. 

So bearing in mind you won't be able to access the money until you are 55 at least (it will be higher by the time you come to retire) I'm not great with how the matching works for pensions but: 

* 5% contribution is £1300. Grossed up is a £1625 contribution. (Your contribution is tax free!) 

* Add your employers contribution of £1300. 

* For a £1300 sacrifice in your salary you walk away with a £2925 contribution to your pension. 

* Your taxable earnings are also reduced by £1300, so you also get a £117 reduction in the amount of student loan you are repaying annually. This will depend on how the pension contribution is paid. 

* If you had it in a pension pot for 32 years, if it was increasing at a rate of 5% (after taking into account inflation) - that £1300 now could be worth £13-14k by the time you wish to withdraw that money in 32 years. By the time you get there, you probably won't be able to withdraw at 55 however. This may be different if you move to a different country. This isn't going to be accurate, but its just what could possibly happen. 

Don't worry about your student loan. It's not perfect but the rate isn't terrible. 

******

So do you think you will value that extra 1.3k this year, or you are more willing to part with a larger amount of money in the future to achieve the same end result?

Unfortunately we have christian fundamentalists in government who are more concerned with flags, marching and discriminating against the gay community than their own people who for some strange reason support them. This element of the government are happy to prop up the current situation for bigoted and egotistical reasons and in many cases refuse to hear any evidence contrary to their own view point. A section of the community identify with another country which they view as superior to this country and regularly march in order to flex their racist muscle. They also use the flag of the country they identify with as a territorial pissing creating divisions. They are quite pleased with this division as it maintains their ego and so we go round and round. They even suppress the native language and ridicule it. 

As you can imagine the fact that they hate the country they were born in creates high levels of confusion among them.

That's the thing; you shouldn't vote for them based on what they say, rather what you believe, and what you believe is best for you and the people you care about.

I should say you should vote for Labour, because I'm a trade unionist, and that's what we do.  But that's not what we do, because Labour doesn't listen to trade unions, just takes their money and pays lip service, but then again no other party has the potential to support trade unions apart from the Greens, but they have wacky ideas about nuclear power, so I'm better off with the Conservatives 'cos I'm in a good paying job but I don't agree with the way they target the less well off instead of making sure it's all round fair so...

Clearly also hasn't a clue about what goes on the the Republic of Ireland. Saying they don't want unification (despite every major poll putting support for unification sky high) and lack of health service and welfare is a lie. They do. Granted neither are as generous as the UK, but they do exist. Also he makes the cardinal mistake of thinking that a United Ireland simply means the border disappears and we are absorbed into the current ROI. Very few republicans aspire to this. A United Ireland would be first and foremost a new country. The idea of the Irish Republic was laid down in the Proclamation read out at Easter 1916 (Highly recommend than OP and this user read it, lays out the sort of republic that Irish people aspire to).

**Conservatives**

The Conservative Party historically believe in a small state and low taxes. Since Margaret Thatcher's introduction of neoliberalism to the United Kingdom in 1979, the Conservatives have strongly felt that individuals should strive to innovate and be successful, and those that do work hard and do innovate should be rewarded and should be allowed to reap the fruits of their labour. For Margaret Thatcher, this meant cutting the top rate of tax, moving from an industrial Britain to a more service-based Britain, privatising various industries (energy, for example), and generally shrinking the state.

When David Cameron became the leader of the Conservative Party, he sought to detoxify the Conservative Party. This meant that he would try to be more socially progressive, for example, through his support for the legalisation of gay marriage. He and George Osborne, his chancellor, however, were still Thatcher's children and believed in free-market ideals, such as lower tax rates for top earners. This is reflected in his/Osborne's lowering of the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. He and his Party still believe that the state should be smaller, and hence he has significantly cut public spending in the name of austerity (tough measures for tough times).

**Labour**

The Labour Party were traditionally the party of the Labourers, hence the name. Affiliated with the various Unions, Labour tried to get a better deal for working class people, partially by nationalising industry and ensuring that the poorest people had access to the services they need. For example, after the 1945 election, Aneurin Bevan, the health minister in the Attlee government, founded the National Health Service, a free health service for every citizen of the United Kingdom.

Moving along, the Party promoted socialist and/or socially democratic values. The fact that until Tony Blair came in, they were, in my opinion, the absolute most left-wing they could have been without becoming a fringe party, meant that they did not have a shot at power because they did not manage to deal with the shrinking working class and growing middle class. 

When Blair got in, however, things changed. New Labour was born. It's primary aim was to gain middle-class support in a changing Britain, and it was hugely successful. By adopting more economically right-wing policies, and moving towards the centre-ground socially, the Labour Party appealed to the masses again, and won the 1997 election in a landslide victory.

If we fast-forward to today, Ed Miliband has replaced Blair and Brown (After the disaster that was the Iraq War, and Brown's PR disaster that was the 2008 financial crisis), and has taken Labour back to a more left-wing position, which was once called *One Nation Labour*, but that hasn't been used in the press so much recently. Miliband has adopted some more genuinely left-wing positions, such as opposing the war in Syria (old-Labour style left wing pacifism and minimal foreign intervention), freezing (or placing a cap on, rather) energy prices for 20 months after he gets into power putting the top rate of tax back up to 50p. While he will still pursue an austerity agenda, it will be a lot more mild than that of the Conservative Party.

**Lib-Dems**

The Liberal Democrats are both socially and economically liberal. They, and especially Danny Alexander, are strong believers in balancing the books, and that was the basis for the coalition they formed with the Tories, however, they are a lot more socially liberal than the Conservatives, even with Cameron's attempts to bring the Tories into the 21st Century.

On the one hand, they have actually introduced a lot of policy by being in the Coalition government, for example, the idea of raising the personal allowance (the amount you can keep tax-free) to over £10,000 was their idea. However, I think that the general public opinion is that they have betrayed the British public by going into a coalition with the Conservatives and by, importantly for students, renegading on their pledge not to raise tuition fees.

**UKIP**

The United Kingdom Independence Party is a right-wing party. It's not centre-right, like the Tories, it's proper right wing (at least in my opinion it is). Whilst some might think that this would mean it appealed to the rich, it is also in favour with a lot of working class people who feel threatened by mass immigration. Their flagship policy is to leave the European Union, and while they say that this is primarily because of a democratic deficit in the EU ('we want our sovereignty back!', etc), in my opinion, the main reason is because they know that the only way to stop the free movement of peoples from the EU, especially Eastern Europe, is the leave the Union altogether. 

UKIP have a lot of, let's say, eccentric individuals amongst their ranks. People that stand out are Godfrey Bloom, who famously referred to women as sluts (although, in fairness, he was using the old-fashioned way of using the word, to mean messy/disorganised), the member who said that the cause of the floods was the legalisation of gay marriage, and many members who want to privatise the National Health Service. 

**Greens**

The Green Party is a left-wing party. They believe in social justice, the welfare state, and environmentalism. The name *The Green Party* tells you that one of their priorities is the environment, and they are big into cutting fossil fuels, using renewable energy sources, etc. One criticism has been that they are anti-science, for example, their alleged support for homeopathy. Another is that they are against nuclear power, which is apparently a fairly cheap energy source that does not burn fossil fuels. Another criticism is that they cannot fund everything they promise, for example, their Citizen's Income would apparently cost in excess of the current welfare budget as a whole. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dFn8RIXOBE) car-crash interview on the Daily Politics demonstrated quite nicely why a lot of people think of the Greens as overly-idealistic and their policies not particularly well-informed.

null,false,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,null,"Left wing vs right wing is a strange concept if you’ve not encountered it before: think of it like a spectrum of colour with lots of different ranges. The general idea is that:

&gt; **Right wing: pro-business, de-regulations, smaller state. Traditional social values.** 

&gt; **Left wing: pro-workers, more regulations, larger state. Progressive social values.** 

Centre politics is somewhere in the middle.

It’s obviously a lot more nuanced and complex than that, and most parties and people take bits from right wing *and* left wing policies.

I'd recommend http://voteforpolicies.org.uk/ (**THIS HASN'T BEEN UPDATED FOR 2015, ALL POLICIES ARE OUT OF DATE AND BASED OFF 2010 MANIFESTO**) which takes the old policies of the political parties in the UK and you can pick and choose which ones you agree with. It'll be updated soon for the 2015 policies.

But here's a brief run-down, hopefully as unbiased as possible, on the major and minor political parties in the UK.

**The Labour Party**: formed in 1900 as a party representing the views of the urban proletariat. With heavy influence from the Trade Unions and socialist groups, the party was traditionally that of the working classes and the poor. Policies were based around labour laws (as the name suggests...), and was very pro-worker. Left leaning in both economic and social issues, they championed the nationalised industries of the UK. In the 1970s they were hit hard with the strikes that brought Britain to a standstill, and many people saw that the trade unionists had taken over the party and were going too far in their demands. They were ousted out of power for a full 18 years and were seen to be floundering. ""New Labour"" was formed in the early 1990s, as a way to drag the party into the modern age by moving policies into the centre (third-way politics), so as to be more attractive to the broad middle class voters. Tony Blair was the most famous of the New Labourites, and he became Prime Minister in 1997 in a landslide election. During his Premiership, we saw Labour move further into the centre, and take on some 'right wing' policies such as fairly draconian surveillance and anti-terror laws. New Labour was also quietly against state control of industries, and promoted capitalism and businesses. Discontent over the Iraq/Afghanistan War, the deficit, and Tony Blair, saw the New Labour brand become fairly toxic to the electorate and Labour was voted out in 2010. Ed Miliband, current Labour Leader, has been fairly derided in the press for being uncharismatic and for having no real policies. The Labour Party is unique in that it sort of has another independent political party *inside* it; The Co-Operative Party which, as the name suggests, stands for the co-operative movement. There is still a split between the New Labour/Blairites who advocate centre-policies, and the Old Labour group who are more traditionally left leaning. 

Currently the general policies of Labour are centre when it comes to economic issues, and slightly centre-left when it comes to social issues.  

**The Conservative Party**: formed in the 19th century as a faction of the Whig Party. Nicknamed ""The Tories"", referencing a political group from the 17th century. The party was generally for the land owners and upper and middle classes of the countryside, and exposed traditional social and religious values, pro business and capitalism. They followed Labour by embracing workers rights, but in the 1970s won a landslide under the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who fought hard to dismantle the Trade Unions; which she was quite successful in doing. Thatcher also took charge of privatising the nationalised industries (telecom, railways, power, water, steel, etc), which many people saw as ""selling off the country to the highest bidder"", although you have to understand that many of these industries in the county at the time were horribly bureaucratic, inefficient, and expensive to run. Thatcher also moved the UK economy from that of an exporter of heavy manufacturing to services, primarily financial. She saw we were unable to compete with the developing nations when it came to cutting manufacturing costs. She adopted a free market policy, promoting businesses and entrepreneurship. However, after 11 years in power and a split within the party, she was finally ousted out in a leadership challenge in 1990. In the 21st century, the Conservatives have modernised their image to appeal to a wider base of voters. Socially they have adopted some traditional left policies, such as gay marriage. David Cameron, in his Premiership, saw tackling the deficit and restarting the economy as the main issues. He has shrunk the state, and has continued to privatise parts of the economy, continuing the promotion of businesses and capitalist ideals. He has been much criticised for welfare reforms, and the rise of 'zero-hour' contracts and short-term employment. There is a certain split in the party between the progressive conservatives, and the traditional right wing faction.

Currently the general policies of the Conservatives are centre-right when it comes to economic issues, and centre when it comes to social issues.

**The Liberal Democrats**: formed in the 1980s as a merger between two liberal parties. As the name suggests the Lib Dems are a social-liberal party with left-leaning policies. They were always the smallest party of the main three, and especially in the beginning were often seen as a 'protest' vote. They appealed mainly to the young and middle classes, with policies promoting environmentalism, progressive taxation, and liberal social and political reform. Social liberalism has always been an important stance, although economically the party is split between 'Orange Bookers' who promote businesses and laissez faire economics, and the 'Social Liberals' who advocate state intervention and more socialist ideals. After much media attention during the 2010 election cycle, the Lib Dems were seen as 'The Kingmaker'; able to go into a coalition with either Labour or Conservatives to ensure an electoral victory. In the end they became the junior partner in the current Coalition Government with the Conservative Party, a partnership seen by many Lib Dem voters as betrayal considering the policies and ideology between both parties were nearly opposite. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats and Deputy Prime Minister, was much derided for breaking his 'electoral promise' on rising university tuition fees; under this Government fees have tripled. As such, the student voters (which made up a large percentage of the Lib Dem electorate) fled the party and support plummeted. In the coalition, the Lib Dems has been seen as dampening several right wing policies of the Conservatives and introducing several liberal policies (such as rising the tax threshold). Unfortunately their main political stance, electoral reform, failed at a public referendum. 

Currently the general policies of the Liberal Democrats are left-wing socially, and centre economically; although supporters would say they don't fit into either and instead are all about ""Liberalism"". 

**Minor Parties**

**United Kingdom Independence Party**: formed in 1993 as a ""single issue"" party; being against the European Union and what they saw as dangerous integration, and the giving up of national sovereignty to the European Parliament. They want to withdraw from the EU, and this is their main electoral promise. Seen as a minor fringe party for most of their years, they gained sudden traction in 2013 and won several local council elections. Discontent with the EU and the Coalition Government saw them gaining big wins in the 2014 EU elections, and membership and vote-share prediction continue to go up and up. Current polls put them at 15% - 20% of the national vote, which is a massive rise in such a short period of time. UKIP, as they are known, are a right-wing party which has populist policies. They aim at the working classes, saying that Labour no longer represents their interests. They are also libertarian; wanting a much smaller state and promoting capitalism and free market economics. However several of their social policies are right wing instead of libertarian, such as being against gay marriage. They are much seen as representing ""traditional British values"", and wanting to cut down heavily on immigration which they see unintegration as a huge threat to the social and economic fabric of society. Several members have been called out for spouting racist, sexist, or homophobic ideas in private and in public, probably because being a fringe party for so long has attracted lots of fringe members. 

Currently, the general policies of UKIP are right-wing socially and right-wing economically. 

**The Green Party**: Three independent parties representing England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. As the name suggests, they promote environmentalism above all others. Part of the world-wide Green movement, founded in the 1970s, the Green Party is socially and economically liberal and left-wing. They want state ownership of key industries/utilities, sustainability in resources, and progressive social and political change. To this end they have policies such as cutting the defence budget, lowering the national speed limit, banning GM crops, banning nuclear power, and banning testing on animals. The party is split between the 'watermelons' who want less extreme policies to promote to the majority of the electorate, and the 'kiwis' who still support the rather extreme green policies such as mandatory vegetarianism. They won a seat in the last General Election and have seen a surge in support, with a lot of disgruntled Liberal Democrats joining them as the only other left-wing party in England. Like UKIP they have lots of extreme/fringe members and policies.

Currently, the general policies of The Greens are left-wing socially and left-wing economically. ",null,0,null,1424039809,null,0,false,0,comhmhn,null,t3_2w0c2i,null,t1_comhmhn,null,t3_2w0c2i,null,null,null,1424609795,null,36,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,36,null

**Scottish National Party**: Founded in the 1930s, as a protest party demanding Scottish independence. They stand only in Scotland, and are seen to be what old Labour used to be like: promoting left-leaning policies and socialism. Scotland was given devolved powers in the 1990s, with it's own Parliament. The SNP quickly came to dominate Scottish national politics, and was widely seen as an alternative to Labour. In the 2007 and 2011 Scottish Elections, the SNP came out as the largest party; they promised an Independence Referendum. This happened in September last year, and was widely reported in the news. The referendum was close, but came down on the side of Scotland staying in the UK. The SNP has continued to grow in support, with many Scots seeing the Coalition Government as unable to represent the interests of the Scottish people. David Cameron presented a ""New Deal"" today, promising further devolution and powers to the Scottish Government. Nevertheless the May election is predicting big gains for the SNP in Scottish seats.

Currently, the general policies of the Scottish National Party are centre left-wing economically and centre left-wing socially. 

**Plaid Cymru:** Formed in 1925, they also advocate independence for Wales from the United Kingdom. Following a similar history as the SNP, Plaid Cymru has never gained as much support regionally although do hold a number of seats in the Welsh Assembly. Their policies are centre left-wing economically and centre left-wing socially. 

**Northern Ireland**. I am in no way knowledgeable of Northern Irish politics. Suffice to say they have their own regional Parliament, and this is split between the Unionist parties (mainly the Democratic Unionist Party) and the National parties (mainly Sinn Féin).

Tory: Yeah. They want to 'fix' the economy by throwing a large number of people under the bus. That's not very nice, especially considering that these are not the people who caused the problems in the first place.

Lib Dems: Untrustworthy in that they are sometimes/frequently forced to break express promises. This is the natural position of the third party. They are forced to compromise so that they can do anything and are naturally going to be remembered for things that went wrong rather than [things that went right](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/#12). If anyone's interested, I'm a socialist and will probably be voting Lib Dem because they're the furthest left party without any direction and any hope.

Or a situation where a large sum of money is donated to a party one year and then the person who donated that money is appointed to the House of Lords a year later.

Unions or businesses could still have input into the political process if parties, like the Labour Party has for unions, to take part in their policy making process through open and honest representation, it would just be the sometimes shadowy world of political funding would be separated out and eliminated.

A Government lasts for under a decade, typically, ending either in electoral defeat or the resignation of the Prime Minister.

It could bring your government down if it goes wrong.

There's the green party's AMA that was up not long ago for a start.

With regards to homeopathy;

&gt;The Green Party supports evidence-based medical treatments, and says only these should be funded by the government. We call for an independent healthcare agency and say ""effectiveness of treatments will be assessed by the agency using the best clinical evidence available"". HE331 http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/he.html[1]
In short we will be supporting whatever has been shown to work!

And nuclear power;
&gt;The Green Party has long been opposed to nuclear on the basis of safety and the problem of fuel disposal. But I’m prepared to put those to one side - people tend to have very fixed views and aren’t often changed.
There’s also cost issues - but the big one for me is that nuclear is slow to get approval and build: way too slow for the urgency of our energy needs or our need to cut carbon emissions.
Solar energy is taking off and costs are plummeting, there’s exciting developments in tidal power, e.g. starting with the Swansea Bay lagoon proposal that’s part of a scheme set to provide 9% of the UK’s electricity demand via tidal in ten years—and hopefully we’ll soon get serious about energy conservation, which would also tackle fuel poverty.
The nuclear issue was debated at the last Green Party conference (a significant proportion voted to support nuclear power) - and it is worth saying that policy in the Green Party is made by our members - any four members can propose a motion to conference and it will be considered.
If you want to change it, I invite you to join the party and put your proposals forward.

Also I believe they removed the basic income from their manifesto and are keeping it as a long term policy.

I'm sure others can chime in on the other parties.",null,0,null,1424041489,null,0,false,0,comien4,null,t3_2w0c2i,null,t1_comien4,null,t1_comhm4o,null,null,null,1424610159,null,36,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,36,null

Moving out shouldn't be too much of an issue, and you really don't want to spend any of that money if you can at all help it. 

Assuming you're on a paid placement, you should be able to support yourself on the income from it. Kudos, you're an adult now! Get yourself some cheap accommodation, within half an hours easy, reliable commute of your office (I'm about an hour away from mine - would not recommend, unless there's an incredibly good reason otherwise). Maybe some friends from uni are working in a nearby location that you can get a place with?

Figure out how to do a budget, and keep adding to your savings every month. Set up a standing order to your savings account each month and don't touch it.

Your employer should offer a pension, although if you're &lt;22 years old, you've probably got to opt in. Do it. You won't notice the difference, and you'll thank yourself later.

As far as where to keep the money, an ISA is probably your best bet. Barclay's does a pretty good interest rate, IIRC. Shop around for the best rate for your needs.

If you wind out needing to take some of the money out of the savings for moving costs (deposit, installation fees, railcard, whatever), make an extra effort to pay that money back ASAP.

The problem with the equivalent Birmingham scheme is Birmingham is too damn big. Manchester council (and city) is only slightly larger than the other cities/towns (Bolton, Wigan, Salford) around it. Their long history of cooperation and with one member not being outrageously larger than the others has certainly helped. 

 But Birmingham absolutely dwarfs Solihull, Wolverhampton, Walsall, Coventry etc. It is the largest local authority in **Europe** already, and convincing the other councils to join with it and placate their fears of being overshadowed is proving difficult. 

The city councils around Birmingham know they will have hugely secondary role to Birmingham if they become a combined authority, it seems the [black country](http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regional-affairs/birmingham-black-country-agreed-combined-8064245) ones have accepted it, but Solihull is not going down without a fight. So far once Coventry and Solihull agree (if they ever do) then it looks set to follow Manchesters example. 

It's good more places are going the way of combined authorities. Hopefully this will lead to better local services and more increased investment. We need more city regions that can compete not only with london but with equivalent regions across Europe and the world, like your Munichs, Vancouver, Milans etc

Labour (last sentence): While he will still pursue an austerity agenda, Labour only intend to balance the 'current budget' and allow borrowing for investment, and to stop cutting the deficit at 3% of GDP, or £25 billion a year.

Lib Dems: no changes

UKIP: I don't think UKIP are really hiding that the main reason they want to leave is immigration, they aren't really hiding behind the democratic deficit argument. Their arguments are always 1) stop giving money to the EU budget and 2) stop high rates of immigration

While the social welfare system in the ROI is nothing to be ashamed of, per capita statistics only really work for comparison when applied to similar sized groups. % of GDP spend on Social Welfare could be seen as a better 'all round' indicator, and that is similar in both countries (around 21%). It's also worth noting that the nature of the NHS and the general UK welfare system is different and when compared to similar systems, per capita spending is around the same.

In short there may be other reasons for higher expenditure than simply (its better). ROI spend is similar per capita to that of the United States, an indication of the relative cost of welfare, rather than it's nature.

&gt; The fact you think that's a good thing speaks fucking volumes; 
&gt; this is a false economy, an economic backwater; a pathetic 
&gt; periphery to London. All we have here are low skilled call centre &gt; jobs

The call centre jobs line is bollocks. There is also a misconception that Northern Ireland fails because it can't 'pay its own way'. Truth is it doesn't have to, one of the benefits of being part of a much larger country. Yes, it should do a lot better, and our economy is stagnated by an overbearing public sector. Salaries are low here, compared to other places and we should be taking full advantage of that.

They don't believe in a small state - this is the party of Theresa May and if you want to be historical then this is the party of Corn Laws against the Liberals.

They are _not_ a libertarian/liberal party. Their policies are incredibly economically biased towards certain groups (mainly property owners and financiers). Furthermore the 'Village Green Preservation Society' wing are positively reactionary against development to a point where it threatens the economic future or our country. The 'swivel-eyed loons' are still alive and well...

Labour have some strange MPs as well like Diane Abbott and Harriet Harman (with the likes of May, Abbott, Thatcher and Harman is it any wonder we don't see more women in the Commons?!) and so they are quite authoritarian as well and also bow to the same populism as the Conservatives albeit for different groups.

OP said he liked science and the Lib Dems have Evan Harris and Julian Huppert in their ranks and sound economic policies (aided somewhat by the acumen of Vince Cable). I am somewhat biased as they are probably my favourite party but I really think they get unfairly blamed given they are a massive minority in the Coalition and it was the only realistic outcome. It's a shame we didn't get PR though.

The Greens are pretty good really, although they are somewhat anti-science and have bizarre beliefs about economics but some of their policies seem well thought out (including basic income) even if their leadership doesn't prepare well for interviews.

The question is simply whether we recover because of Conservative stewardship or in spite of it. I would argue that our considerable lagging behind the United States (who did not follow austerity) and the warnings of the IMF that we should stop austerity show that the Conservative strategy has done more harm than good.

It's not a family budget - if the government doesn't borrow then the economy can freeze up leading to even greater debt or a national decline. 

To be honest given it seems we could well enter deflation (which was the warnings the IMF have been giving for years now about austerity) I'm amazed that anyone is still preaching this idea that the Conservative are 'better with the economy'

I have to point out that this promise was made on the understanding that they'd do it if they became the government. They didn't - they actually *lost* seats and then had to compromise to become a junior partner in the coalition.

It's a facile argument that a lot of people fall into and while it must feel very personal for you, I'd encourage you to think of it this way:

* ""If you give me ten pounds I'll buy you a new toy truck""
* ""I'll give you five pounds""
* ""I can't get you the truck you wanted; I don't have enough money""
* ""YOU BASTARD WHERE'S MY TRUCK OMG YOU LIED!""

They didn't break a promise - their promise was based on conditions that never worked out because we, the electorate, didn't hold up our end. Now the real issue is that Cleggy then went on to say that they should never have *made* the promise in the first place, which implies strongly that they wouldn't have implemented even as a majority government.

I try to be, that's kind of the linguistic meaning of 'Muslim', surrendering your actions to God's instructions. It's alien to British culture in the same sense any kind of serious theism is, but that's the paradigm.

In that sense, free mixing is the best practical example of how Muslims are separate. Most scholars have no issue with it so long as it is appropriate. Appropriate is the interesting word. Some say today's society is too indecent and corrupt, hence Saudi Arabia. 90%ish say it's the way the first generation of Muslims lived and how everyone has always been, so it's fine - hence most other Muslim countries. The segregation happens in the private sphere. Friendship groups tend to self-segregate, by extension from flirting being clearly forbidden outside marriage (though it happens in Muslim countries in certain circles, it's not societally accepted). I actually find this one of the more understandable rules; there's not much point to marriage if each of the partners has already had a dozen exploits to varying degrees of seriousness. The real example that matters though is places of work and study, i.e. mixing *for a viable reason*. Generally, if you've been to any city, you'll see Muslims do so, and have no problems with it. Almost every Muslim country has that as well. So the difference in behaviour and mindset is in the private sphere.

&gt;

&gt;__Tantallon Castle__ is a semi-ruined mid-14th-century fortress, located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) east of [North Berwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick), in [East Lothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lothian), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). It sits atop a promontory opposite the [Bass Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Rock), looking out onto the [Firth of Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth). The last medieval curtain wall castle to be constructed in Scotland,  Tantallon comprises a single wall blocking off the headland, with the other three sides naturally protected by sea cliffs.

&gt;Tantallon was built in the mid 14th century by [William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Douglas,_1st_Earl_of_Douglas). It was passed to his illegitimate son, [George Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Douglas,_1st_Earl_of_Angus), later created [Earl of Angus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Angus), and despite several sieges, it remained the property of his descendants for much of its history. It was besieged by King [James IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_IV_of_Scotland) in 1491, and again by his successor [James V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland) in 1528, when extensive damage was done. Tantallon saw action in the [First Bishops' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bishops%27_War) in 1639, and again during [Oliver Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell)'s invasion of Scotland in 1651, when it was once more severely damaged. It was sold by the Marquis of Douglas in 1699 to [Hew Dalrymple, Lord North Berwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hew_Dalrymple,_Lord_North_Berwick) and the ruin is today in the care of [Historic Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Scotland).

When the Doctor and Clara arrive at the coordinates provided, they see Gallifrey in all its glory, the people celebrating, welcoming him home with open arms.  The Doctor is suspicious at first, but comes to believe that Gallifrey has returned in peace.

However, Clara starts getting headaches and sees blurry and ""pixilated"" things and people.  The Doctor has to look through Clara's eyes to see that this world - this Gallifrey - is nothing but an empty, barren world with an incredible artificial intelligence driven solid-light hologram.

They try to escape, but cannot find the TARDIS as the computer hides it behind and within other scenery.  Eventually, Clara convinces the Doctor to talk to the AI and they discover that it is incredibly lonely since the people of its world died, many thousands of years ago.  The Doctor splits the AI into two separate programs, creating a friend and companion for the original AI.

Later, on the TARDIS, Clara expresses her sympathy that it wasn't Gallifrey after all.  The Doctor brushes it off, saying he would be able to tell without a doubt when he finds the *real* Gallifrey, and turns away.  The look on his face as the story ends is one of pure fury.

So you are essentially repeating what he said. Being administered by another country also has negative consequences, Jobs, innovation and wealth are drawn to the centre, We are a mere periphery to London. 300 DVA jobs where moved to swansea at the stroke of a pen; a sign of things to come. Our stagnant economy has more to do with being in an unhealthy relationship with a dominant partner, in which some described has ""Having it good"", i would describe it as being on Life support. 

&gt; 'pay its own way'. Truth is it doesn't have to.

This is a bizarre statement, the rest of the UK looks upon NI as a parasite and it is, how long do you think that NI can keep this up.

&gt; and our economy is stagnated by an overbearing public sector.

And you essentially agree! I wouldn't blame the public sector though there is no evidence that shrinking it will have any positive effect on the private sector whatsoever. Most likely it will do serious damage to it given that the private sector here is heavily reliant on public sector jobs. Slashing Public Services will most likely send the existing private sector into freefall.

You've already noticed that getting impartial coverage is difficult, particularly in popular media. But that's not to write off media coverage altogether, as biases are generally pretty static over time and are known: papers such as the Express and Daily Mail are written with a right wing bias, the Guardian and the Mirror with a left wing bias, the BBC broadly impartial but tending toward whoever is in government at the time, magazines such as The Economist biased towards whoever is most favourable for capitalists and business in general, Private Eye broadly cynical of absolutely everyone. 

If you know how the editorial opinions you consume are biased ahead of time, you can take in information more critically. Rather than accepting everything as 100% truth or lie, you notice how underlying biases can slant a story, and make your own mind up easier. You can also use this knowledge to dissect what you hear. If the Guardian is tearing into a Tory policy, see how the same story is featured by the Telegraph, or Sky News and vice versa. Note how arguments are rebutted. Labour say their policy is this. The Tories say it won't work because of this reason. This left wing website notes that that's exactly what they would say, because they have donors from this vested interest. And so on. 

Accept that every time you hear a politician speak they are trying to protect the image of their party by drawing the conversation to topics they are comfortable talking about. It's easy to be cynical and say ""well, you can't trust a word they say, they all lie"" and wash your hands of engaging in politics entirely. But if you're informed on what their policies and other people's criticisms of them are, you can filter out the spin and see what's really being said. Often the reason given for a policy, and the justification for it, is not the whole reason that it's actually there at all. Engaging with the wider conversation and reading outside your filter bubble will help with that.

Not all sources of information are equally good - that much is obvious.

But this specific policy is based on the recommendations of the extensive Corston report, welcomed by organisations like the Prison Reform Trust and the Howard League for Prison Reform among others.

Which does point out that it's based on the Corston Report; Available here; http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/corston-report-march-2007.pdf

Which is a report based on studies in female prisons.

I can't say I stand behind that report (and it is a barmy report) without also having a likewise report and policies on mens prison sentencing, which is hopefully something that will get brought up a lot more within the party in the coming months.

It's all about just weighing up the pros with the cons I guess.

The risk associated to debt should be measured by the interest rates you pay, and the UK currently pays very low interest rates for its debts. The long term viability of debt is crucially linked to demographic development, and as the UK is projected to keep growing in population the per capita debt will decrease that way, too (as opposed to Germany, that really needs to bring down the debt now rather than later). A corollary is that immigration is a great way to reduce the impact of debt (any new worker that comes in does not  bring in any existing debt but contributes to the economy). Finally you could still ask if debt reduction is best done through revenue or spending, and the Tory government is planning to bring spending down to levels not seen in this century.

Inequality is also a potential driver of future economic risk. And while the UK debt is historically moderate, UK inequality is historically high.

In summary, Tory policies are deeply ideologically driven (note I'm not arguing that this is not the case for the other parties, too). Best example of this is the NHS policies. The completely state run NHS is the most efficient health service in the developed world, far more cost efficient than the more market base continental systems.

They are very pro business and on people being rewarded for doing things themselves with little help from the state... but not without some help... they will not disband the NHS or get rid of the Welfare system... their way of giving incentives is kinda in my view as I say I'm left wing fucked up beyond all belief but they do it because they beleive we will all be better for it (it can be argued both ways if that is true or not). They have continued labours work with privacy laws. I don't agree with their economic plans, cutting the deficit to 0 is just stupid because inflation naturally gets rid of debt so most countries run a deficit. That's just some simple economics. 

Lib Dems are not untrustworthy they said they would first attempt to form a government with whoever got the most votes. They horse traded the AV referendum for higher tuition fees... we just weren't smart enough to vote for it. They're goals are left wing but I haven't read their new manifesto yet.

Greens did an AMA but they're clouded in bullshit by the press, I'm not even voting for them but go read their AMA on reddit and you'll see that their policies that spouted in the press as being 'crazy' are actually long term goals. For example opening up borders.... that's a very long term goal which they say requires alot of international co-operation. Basically they get a bad ride but their hearts in the place of making things better for everyone.

UKIP are not quite nutty but they do attract some odd people, their main policy of leaving the EU has up sides and downsides. (The downsides outweigh the good economically, but socially it's up to you to look at arguments on both sides.).

  I feel that the immediate course of British Islam is going to be difficult. My personal feeling is that the Islamic community as a whole (rather than specific ethnic religious groups, which seems to be half the problem) will have to face some difficult questions regarding its own future, and in particular issues of integration and assimilation into the wider British community. I know that many Muslims already have little problem with this but that isn't ALL Muslims. 

  Soomething that may influence things though is the rise in British-born imams and Islamic scholars. This is likely to be a difficult concept for a non-Muslim to understand but I'll try and explain.  At present you're often dealing with imams and scholars who have little experience of British culture or the unique issues of British Muslims,  and who may also not necessarily speak English particularly well, creating a linguistic as well as cultural wall between them and those they are meant to be guiding. I am hoping that these newer scholars and imams will serve to help create a form of Islam more in tune to Britain. 

  However I also fear that those who genuinely espouse islamophobia may seize the current situation, or in future, to actively attack the Muslim community here, innocent or not of any wrongdoing. It is for this reason I am actively considering leaving the UK for good.

I said near free, I am under no illusions there are some costs involved. I am of the opinion that you could just allocate a fixed amount per party. A party being decided by say having to have a certain amount of members. They use that to spend on campaign costs and they keep it fucking cheap.

Half our problems in politics come from the dog and bone show media led bullshit machine so I don't see why we can't fix 2 problems at once.

If the elected officials want to communicate with people I would rather they did it themselves than hiring people to 'sell' for them.

There was a girl who was a little worse for wear that night that was apparently asking our touring buddies if she could tag along to the next city and such, and we never saw her again, but the next morning we had concerned messages from people checking with us to make sure she was safe, etc. Never seen anything like that, but it didn't seem like a drug den, but a place where like minded people would hang out and rock out to some bands/musicians. Everybody was looking out for each other and it was pretty obvious that it was nothing more than just that. I find it very hard to believe that a lot of these allegations are true.

* The fact is we have ***slightly*** easier route to the finish line than the people above us, so that has to count for something. 
* The consistency is building game by game. Several of the points we've dropped against lower competition were earlier in the season when we had a veritable vichyssoise of midfield tandems. Capoue is a great talent but closer to a rugby union player than a stalwart in the heavy-press, up-tempo Pochettino style of football. Lennon was all pace and no creativity. Paulinho is I don't even know. Now with a useful rotation of Eriksen/Chadli/Lamela/Bentaleb/Mason/Dembele/Townsend we can play the style of football Poch wants to play every game.
* All that said, I think this puts our destiny in our own hands. If we continue to build on our new style and play the football we saw against Chelsea and Arsenal, I think we're a 50/50 for top 4. If we didn't get it, it'd be because someone else deserved it more. Unless we digress, I feel top 6 is probable and top 5 is within reach.
* IF we manage to lift the League Cup, can you imagine the confidence boost that'd give us for the next few weeks? We'd be well up for it against the next 3-4 opponents, who happen to be 
Swansea, @QPR, and @Man U.

Maybe some aspects like the recent Leon Britain/Elm Guest House stuff but some of the older allegations are pretty accepted as fact by all, with actual people charged with specific crimes, some of which were found guilty and are currently incarcerated. 

Some examples:

The last one is probably the worst; it involves MI5 bringing politicians into the abuse gangs for the purposes of blackmail.

From the relevant government inquiry (1982):

&gt; ""The events giving rise to this Inquiry...can no longer be regarded as exceptional. They must perhaps be recognised as earlier symptoms of a general malaise permeating the United Kingdom.""

And more recently:

&gt; In August 2014 a former intelligence officer, Brian Gemmell, said that he also had been ordered to stop investigating allegations of abuse at the home.[12] He said that he learned details of what happened in the home while gathering information on loyalists.[12] He was told he was running two agents who had close links to the home.[12] As well as telling him not to investigate, the senior officer told him to stop running an agent.[12] He had spoken out anonymously before, but dropped his anonymity because he wanted the allegations to be investigated again.[12]",null,0,null,1424056662,null,0,false,0,compx7b,null,t3_2vzdv1,null,t1_compx7b,null,t1_comgpqn,null,null,null,1424613677,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;When Gomez scores the penalty, he walks past me and says, ""OK, I want to see you now."" And I scored. 

&gt;After we won, I went over to him and he said, ""oh my God don't talk to me, you must have some magic or something.""

Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in our solar system occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity; another the density of the gas involved; another is the energy content or wind energy of a wind.
In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, hurricane, and typhoon. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.
In human civilization, wind has inspired mythology, influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.
Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind affects the spread of wildfires. Winds disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.

* 62 per cent of the total population stated their identity was ‘Scottish only’.

* second most common response was ‘Scottish and British identities only’, at 18 per cent

* ‘British identity only’ was chosen by 8 per cent of the population.

* ‘Other identity only’ represented 4 per cent of the population.

[sauce](http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/news/census-2011-detailed-characteristics-ethnicity-identity-language-and-religion-scotland-%E2%80%93)

Also worth noting:

&gt; 8 per cent of the total population stated their national identity as ‘British identity only’. Of these,  49 per cent stated their ethnicity as ‘White: Scottish’, 38 per cent were ‘White: Other British’, and 8 per cent were ‘Asian’.

so a notable number of the ""British only"" folks are immigrants from elsewhere in the UK and further afield.

null,false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,null,"Holy crap! Fuck all this fairness and niceness, this is politics. I've followed it since the late eighties so let me give you a brief and highly opinionated run down.  

Basically the one highly important thing you have to remember first of all is that the system is rigged. We run a First Past the Post System (FPTP) and the majority of the seats are locked up safely. Your vote unless its for one of the main two will likely have no literal impact at all on this election. The first past the post system means that any votes that didn't go to the winner in a given bourough are discarded and there are many, many ""safe seats"".  If you happen to live in one then basically you don't get to play at democracy. Unlucky.   
Basically FPTP means that the Lib Dems last time got 25% of the vote but like 6% of the seats or some other silly sort of statistic like that.  However this doesn't mean its pointless to vote for anyone else, there are two major reasons to vote for different parties:  

* Give the populace _belief_ for the following election. - Most election campaigns are run on the premise of ""This party can't win here so don't vote for them"" so adding your vote to the tally weakens the hold the big two have on the system.  
* The realistic reason. When one of the major parties loses hardcore they tend to have a moment of reflection and in this moment look at where they lost votes and often pick up very watered down versions of their policies. So your vote might mean the Tories or Labour examine a favoured policy of whoever you voted for.  

So yes, utlimately the process is incredibly depressing and inevitable, still for some dumb reason I still stay up and watch the results every time..... I think I'm just a sucker for punishment.  

Anyhow the parties:  

First off, a pre-amble about the ""big-two"". You have to respect the post-Clinton era. Clinton demonstrated the very best thing to do in politics is say absolutely nothing and just smile and look good on camera. It works, it wins you votes and prevents you from having to declare what you're actually about. Both of the big two follow this mantra to the letter and try their very best to say absolutely nothing. Their hidden agendas still exist to an extent but you wont hear them talk about them explicitly.

Tories: I genuinely wonder these days who the fuck the Tories represent these days. I mean I know, I just don't like to be mean. The fact that they're willing to give time to re-instating the ""sport"" of fox hunting but wont give time to my tea cosy knitting society tombola that I have oft told them about gives one a hint. I figure the same amount of people knit tea cosies as hunt foxes but hey, I guess I just don't have their ear. Ultimately even when I'm trying to be nice you can't hide from the fact that irrespective of what the Tories ever say or promise, they represent old money and the establishment. Great at lying, barely ever implement anything postive they promise or hint at and ""business as usual"" favours for friends and their backers. Expect a ""tough"" and incompetant home office trying to transform the UK into an Orwellian novel because their friends at GCHQ keep telling them how they _need_ to do this to catch the terrorists they created through their previous shadow boxing and proxy wars.  
Their ""hidden agenda"" is basically a slow death of the welfare state. Its an easy job because its an exponential cost and the trick is just to not increase investment and then it slowly dies by itself. In terms of budgets, expect cuts to the poor, some sort of tax break for the wealthy or reasonably well off a bit of military spending. Chummy with the Yanks.  
Apparently considering giving free wifi on trains if they get in. A shit bribe but considering what's on offer not a bad one. :D

Labour: If Tories represent old money then Labour represent ever so slightly newer money, think more fourties and fifty year olds than sixty to seventies if you will. Labour used to be slightly fun and actually represented a different idealology. Then they lost three elections in a row even one where they were ""dead certs"" (turns out Neil Kinnock is a bit of a pillock). Anyhow after that John Smith was in charge but he suddenly heart attacked and Tony Blair took that opportunity to completely change Labour. After seeing the previous election failures and losing his book of Marx he rebranded the party ""New Labour"" which more accurately would be ""New Tory"". You genuinely can't tell the parties apart anymore. Watch: In The Thick of It. It's pretty accurate in terms of what they're both really about. Just desperate for power and out of ideas. 
Anyhow Labour's ""secret agenda"" is keeping the welfare state alive. They'll try to increase investment but likely just piss the money away on consulting and leave it slightly worse. They have exactly the same issues as the Tories do in terms of keeping promises and being pretty cosy with the establishment, also Chummy with the Yanks but also somewhat cosy with the Euro's too. Less likely to steal UKIP's manifesto if they suffer a drubbing.  
For some reason a lot of people still vote for these people because they think they're still socialist. They're not, don't vote for them because you think they're socialist please. If you're socialist actually you want to vote Green this time.  

Lib Dem: Exactly the same as the other two in terms of Clinton-esqe waffle although you stand a much better chance in getting a straight answer out of your representative than the other two parties whose representatives are often spineless puppets trapsed out for election time to beck and call at the sound of the party whip should they actually win. I've got more time for this party than most possibly because they still actually _try_ to represent their constituents because they're actually having to try to win. If you go read the Hansard you'll find their representatives are often the ones asking ""annoying"" questions and try to slow down scary fucking shit being put through government.  
Ultimately though incredibly boring and somewhat tame. I wouldn't expect any more from them than the other two should they get into power although I'd like to watch the power corrupt them.  
Their agenda isn't particularly ""hidden"" they just want to raise taxes a bit on the rich, cut them a bit on the poor and try to be ""nice"". They support the welfare state, they're Euro-friendly.  
Just as likely as any other candidate to fail on their election promise but if they did I'd at least expect an apology.  
This is typically what I vote for, partly as a ""fuck you"" to the main two and also because my rep who was Lib Dem was an amazingly nice person who always took the time out to respond to the letters her constituents sent. She's not standing this year though D:.  

UKIP: Dear fucking god. If you want to vote for a party that was almost stolen from Farage by Robert Killroy Silk then you're out of your fucking mind. When the Tories got their act together sometime in the 90's and kicked out the more repulsive elements of their party (think Enoch Powell and people that would have cheered as his speeches) we all laughed. Gone were the visible, grotty Tories that wore racism on their sleeve and said all sorts of incredibly fucked up shit that would make you spit your breakfast cereal across the room listening to the Today program in the morning. Little did we know they'd sit in the shadows until everyone forgot who the fuck they were and come back later offering their easy answers to questions no-one fucking asked. Obviously its the Jews! Wait, wrong century! It's the European Union/Immigrants to blame for whatever just vote for us. 
Hate plank party, avoid at all costs. If they ever got into power they'd just do exactly the same thing as the Tories (aside from their headline policy) but we'd have to listen to them instead of the plastics. I'd rather keep the cereal in my mouth myself.  

Greens: Holy fuck, finally a party whose manifesto isn't just:  

&gt; more of the same please.  

There was a time, long forgotten when politics was about idealology and ideas. Like.... imagining what you think the future should be like instead of just saying the stuff people want to hear to get voted in.
The Greens seem to remember what that was like. If you're bored of politics and life I guess then definitely vote Green. I'm massively tempted myself. I dislike a lot of their policies but I'm just genuinely entertained by the premise.  
Hilariously socialist, incredibly idealistic and woefully naive (we don't need no guns! Russia.... Russia.... what you dooin.... put the gun down, give back Crimera and we'll give you a hug, k?) and likely the most dangerous political party out of all of them should they ever come to power. Out of all of them if they got in (which they can't because of the system) you'd personally feel an impact in your life. Likely negative but maybe some positive too.... who knows! But yea, that's why I think they're fun. There was an internal fight in the party recently between the mangos and the watermelons (srs, they're the faction names) in the Green party. The mangos were like Lib Dems, think wishy-washy, compromising, diplomatic.... dull. The watermelons are ""green on the outside, red on the inside"". So hardcore socialism wrapped in environmentally friendly policies. The watermelons won.

null,false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,null,"&gt; THAT IS TOO LONG

Sayeth reddit. This is a very short part two.

So anyway, that's most of the parties, then you have the nationalists... if you hate the English then vote for them by all means.   
If I listen to your words then:  

&gt; I'm a student who believes strongly in scientific investment and innovation.

It really depends on what flavour you're into. The Yanks or the Euros. Tories and UKIP are the Yanks, Lib Dem and Labour are the Euros. E.G. Labour and Lib Dem would likely uphold EU protocol in regards to rulings such as software patents whereas the Tories and UKIP would more quietly take America's approach.  
None of the parties as far as I'm aware really represent science. The Greens are into environmental science if that's your gig. Out of all of them I think the Greens maybe are most likely to spend on science because they're idealistic, but then they're also scared of some science like GM and other breakthrough research.... the others would rather spend the cash paying back their backers or buying votes. To be honest I don't think science has a party representing them. D:.  
If you think innovation means molycoddling startups then _maybe_ the Tories might be worth a punt. If you had some sort of ""innovative start up"" for example, they won't listen to you unless you have money, connections or would actually be politically useful to them (the latter most likely) but out of all of them if that's what innovation means to you then that might be the best fit.

First thing you really need to do is work out if you're going to be voting tactically or not. Check the results of your constituency and see how much of a lost cause it is. Then decide whether you want to influence this election but go down on record as a Tory/Labour supporter or just be ""one for the stats"" and vote what your heart says.  

All in all good luck! Oh and welcome to the highly depressing subject that is British politics. ;).

2.Fast Creative Players+ Lucas and Sakho. Do you remember Coutinho's form early season? I do, I remember being astounded how someone could look so good in pre-season yet play like pants a week later when the season kicked off. Do you remember Sakho being dropped for Everton and walking out, he was dropped because he was playing like crap. Lallana had an injury earlier in the season too, and obviously that would take time for him to come back from that. So who is it exactly you wanted to play instead of a change in system? Markovic? do you remember his first games, he barely looked like a footballer. Moreno? had a good goal against Spurs but his inexperience in the prem led directly to two goals (1 against City too).

This isn't Football Manager where you throw in all your new buys 2 months in and everything comes up rosy. The plan has come together, no one with half a brain expected this season, particularly the beginning to be easy with so many new players to bed in. It became worse with Sturridge's injury that Rodgers had to find a new system to work out. I find it hilarious that your main argument is that he should have been playing fast-creative players who are doing well NOW when they were all doing shit THEN. If Rodgers had done everything you'd still be out here saying ""PLAY BALOTELLI or PLAY LOVREN he's our most expensive defender"".

You'd think the guy who's on the training pitch everyday has a better idea of who to play in the match. Like I said most of us who had reasonable expectations going into the season weren't deterred that Rodger's would find a way out of it and to his credit he has.

You'd want to pay £1k into NW from TSB on say the 1st of the month (standing order) then pay £1k from NW to TSB on the same day, as long as you have both maxed out it will never be a problem.. If you have another current account somewhere with a spare 1k in then use that instead as you won't loose 1-2 days worth of interest from the TSB while it is in NW.

Another option I am considering for left over money at the moment as opposed to Santander (I don't have many DDs and use the ones I do have for a halifax reward) is to get a second TSB account that is joint with a parent, it means you can have another £2000 in the account at a still good rate.
