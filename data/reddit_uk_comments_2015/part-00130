Those constituencies are Sevenoaks, Somerset North, South Holland &amp; The Deepings and Witney.

May I ask where you got the data from? Because unless I'm being very stupid, the Electoral Commission's data suggests that that isn't true for any of those constituencies with the exception of Witney. To use Sevenoaks as an example:

[Link](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/uk-general-elections/2010-uk-general-election-results/sevenoaks?undefined=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.electoralcommission.org.uk%2Ffind-information-by-subject%2Felections-and-referendums%2Fpast-elections-and-referendums%2Fuk-general-elections%2F2010-uk-general-election-results%2Fsevenoaks)

- Electorate: 69591
- Total number of votes cast: 49646
- Uncast votes: 69591 – 49646 = 19945
- Majority: 17,515

...so if those uncast votes had been cast for the second-placed candidate, he would have overtaken the actual winner.

Here are the links for the other two constituencies if you want to check:

You'll probably find that if this is a scam then some swarthy looking guy (who doesn't quite seem like the property-ladder type) will turn up, have a bloody good look around the lounge and the kitchen and glance at the bedrooms then vanish off. They probably line up half a dozen appointments like this - because they only need one to be lucky.

Might help to have a mate about aswell (or just hide any valuables somewhere well out the way - like your car boot) incase two of them turn up and one tries to distract you.

But it's his right to withdraw request to be filmed, is it not? I don't think it's fair to discriminate based on his wishes, his *rights*. So, if he wants to do his job without being filmed, that's his right, surely? You'll have to clue me up on that one because you are more knowledgeable in this than I am.

The entire video can be summarised like this: horse guys don't want to be filmed, police make a fair request that this guy stops filming, guy gets livid that his rights are being encroached. Rights are more important to this guy than the well being of the people he is filming. Isn't that a little hypocritical? Just my thoughts.

This is understandable, you can fire an employee or reduce their hours but you can't get rid of the new machine / piece of software you bought to increase productivity if demand suddenly drop.  Thus this is a perfectly normal phase in the economic cycle. 

However, it's bad for such a period to last too long. Such low productivity jobs mean that consumers have less disposable income and will dampen domestic demand, basically the cost of living crisis. It could also lead to social issues as those employed in such jobs receive little to no training etc. and are considered expendable, thus they have no new skills and will find it hard to get anything other than a low paying job.

It's also bad for the companies, if more people are being hired to fill these jobs then the labour market will tighten (fewer unemployed people), this will produce upward pressure on wages, as it becomes harder to fill positions people can demand higher wages. Wage growth without productivity growth will begin to reduce profits. Moreover, without investment it will be harder for companies to respond to the (hopefully) inevitable increased demand and leave it vulnerable to start-ups which are more productive or offer new technologies.

Im sure he can but I wouldnt have a huge amount of faith in him making that big a difference.

Im not sure ive seen him be on the receiving end of a throughball in basically his whole THFC career though. Sure he has the physical attributes but the fact is that he simply doesnt. Hopefully he can develop the skillset during preseason but frankly I dont see any real possibility that he would have come on during the match and suddenly begin doing something which hes never really done effectively before.

I certainly wasnt against bringing him on but he wasnt as obvious a substitution as people are making put IMO. 

&gt; Dembele would have been a better bet than Paulinho, but I'm no fan and I get the impression that Pochettino has already made a decision on Dembele - presumably that he can't really be relied upon

While this could certainly be true Im not reall sure what Poch is basing it on. Hes being consistently a strong performer this calender year bar the West Ham game. Lets not he forget he played a key role in our two best performances this season vs Arsenal and Chelsea.

**By 2020, Parliament should be fully interactive and digital.**

This means enabling the public to submit questions to Parliament and to digitally contribute to different stages of the law-making process.

By 2016 there should be a a new set of online tools for drafting, amending and publishing legislation which are easier to use and provide open data about bills and amendments.

**The 2015 newly elected House of Commons should immediately create a new forum for public participation in the debating function of the House of Commons**

This would initially take the form of a ""Cyber Chamber"" or an ""Open House"", but would be integrated with the House of Commons should it prove successful in its first term.

**By 2020, secure online voting should be an option for all voters.**

(self explanatory)

**By 2016, all published information and broadcast footage produced by Parliament should be freely available online in formats suitable for re-use.**

All parliamentary information will be required to be public domain and parliamentary footage will be unrestricted by copyright.",null,0,null,1428438038,null,0,false,0,cq4ibgy,null,t3_31scb4,null,t1_cq4ibgy,null,t3_31scb4,null,null,null,1432252932,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Driving round London, which is where I learnt (including on A roads with speed limits of 50 - 70), it feels very much like you go at the speed limit unless there is a very good reason to be going slower (i.e. a person or congestion of cars ahead). Going slower, much like not taking safe opportunities to pull out at junctions and the like, was being too hesitant and something to be rebuked for - because you weren't going at the speed of traffic on the road. And it can become dangerous if cars behind you are expecting you to speed up when you don't, or if they get frustrated or aggressive (that is their fault, not yours, but that doesn't make it any less scary).
It took a while to work out how to do country roads with national speed limits where you have to actually judge what a safe speed to drive down this empty road is rather than just go at the speed limit by default.

null,false,WindyCOYS,flair8,,null,"&gt;Im not sure ive seen him be on the receiving end of a throughball in basically his whole THFC career though. Sure he has the physical attributes but the fact is that he simply doesnt. Hopefully he can develop the skillset during preseason but frankly I dont see any real possibility that he would have come on during the match and suddenly begin doing something which hes never really done effectively before.

He's done it before and can do it - the key is coming on with instructions to do it. If your coach says ""go on, play high, run in behind"", then even the most dumb player can manage it.

&gt;While this could certainly be true Im not reall sure what Poch is basing it on. Hes being consistently a strong performer this calender year bar the West Ham game. Lets not he forget he played a key role in our two best performances this season vs Arsenal and Chelsea. Statistically our two best pressing performances this season have being vs Arsenal and Liverpool - two games he played in.

He played a part in both of those to varying degrees and he's done fine in some games, but he's not a player that I think adds much to the team. He's got all the talent in terms of touch and dribbling, is as strong as an ox, but he's not a good passer or shooter, lacks vision, is ponderous and can too often be lethargic.

Stambouli certainly hasn't held for us. He's only ever played a role where he presses the ball, and he's done it pretty well IMO. I'm sure he could play a disciplined holding role but we've not seen him do it. But yeah, I'd be just as happy with him holding and Bentaleb/Mason either side of him, pressing and breaking.

&gt; Based on what though? Again I dont mean to sound like a dick but im just not sure how you can come to that conclusion based on this seasons evidence.

Described it above, but for me Dembele constantly flatters to deceive and achieves little. Holds onto the ball too long and slows everything down to walking pace. Stambouli keeps it simple - gets it and gives it in minimal touches and also forces the opposition into errors with his sharp pressing.

Also, it's certainly not true that experienced profs are always better supervisors than PhD students or early career postdocs.

The biggest factor for finding good supervisors is how motivated the DoS is. When I started supervising, I got the call (as a second year PhD student) at the last minute from a DoS who hadn't been able to find anyone else. Now, I only supervise for DoSs I know and respect, and who care about their students (and their results). And I'm much more motivated to spend my time on the students. Plus, I'm more proactive when there are problems, as I have a good relationship with the DoS.

So if the DoS is organized and student orientated, there's every chance that they can find a good supervising team despite being at a small college with few internal resources.

What I'm saying people shouldn't do is leverage themselves to hell in order to buy a crappy property that only serves to cripple them financially (and potentially drive them into insolvency when interest rates rise) and lock them into living in a single area during the early stages of their careers.

So many of us have grown up with the idea that owning a property is inherently a good thing, because houses always rise in value. Young people often lack the life experience  and personal finance education to question whether this actually makes sense for their situation - several of my friends fell into the trap of buying property in 2006/7 that has only recovered its pre-crash value since 2011.

OP in this case was asking whether it was a good idea to abandon a burgeoning career and moving to the arse end of nowhere, or even worse - Wales - in order to get on the first rung of the property ladder.

Essentially, he was asking if he should sacrifice everything he has worked for up to this point on the altar of residential property.

&gt; , the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures use proportional voting systems. Why should the body purporting to represent the democratic will of the English—English votes would turn English MPs into a de-facto English Parliament—not do the same? Each English MP's vote could be weighted according to the total number of English voters who backed his party, ensuring proportional representation without breaking the constituency link. Smaller parties without MPs could provide representatives for such votes (perhaps from a list published before general elections) to ensure proportionality.

He hasnt played as anything but a holding midfielder in the PL though other than maybe that sub appearence vs Sunderland at the start of the season as far as i can remember. He seemed to have some freedom to go forward in the europa league - but well that was in the Europa league against sub standard opposition. His position in France was as predominantly a holding midfielder and as an emergency centre back, certainly not as an advanced midfielder.

&gt; for me Dembele constantly flatters to deceive and achieves little. Holds onto the ball too long and slows everything down to walking pace

He certainly isnt particularly productive however he helps transition from defence into attack quite well. Also his chance creation stats have been strong this season and he has been fairly productive this calender year. 

Hes certainly not the most productive player but its absurd to think that Stambouli would be more so given that Stambouli has - in his whole career in Ligue 1 - 3 assists and 3 goals. 

I havent noticed any drop in the quality of our attack when he has played as the advanced midfielder.

And when he left, we were still behind them.

I loved Rafa when he was our manager, but actually his track record as a manager of Liverpool isn't all that much better than Houllier's (and if you go on win rate he's only slightly ahead of BR right now), and we're not clamouring to have him reinstated at the club. Yes, his departure wasn't on the most sensible of terms and there were fans calling for him to stay, but I also remember plenty of fans who weren't too upset that he was gone (aside from lack of a suitable replacement). 

I also think in terms of our current crop of players, the transition from Brendan Rodgers to Rafa would be incredibly jarring. BR is someone who seems to take great care in the relationship with his players and running the stern-but-fair, father figure type role, whilst all anecdotes about Rafa paint him in a notoriously blunt and unemotional light, where sentimentality is always second to football. 

Maybe if Rafa had come in originally instead of BR we'd be in a better place, but I definitely think that right now swapping managers would set us back more than it would bring us forward.

&gt; I was gutted that 1 poor season after years of steady improvement cost him his job

To quote your first post on Rafa, I think this would also be the case with BR if we got rid of him at the end of the season. And in reality this season hasn't actually ended up that poorly considering our league form in the last 5-6 years and the fact that our current squad has so much potential given the average age of our first XI.

A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: “The investigation is being carried out by detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command.

“They are appealing for anyone who may have been in the area of Greenhill, junction with The Paddocks, from about 10am this morning who may have seen a dark coloured Volkswagen Passat or anything suspicious to get in touch.”

The statement said police are “retaining an open mind regarding the possible motive”.

Anyone with information can call 020 8358 0400 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

&gt;It ended because our captain lost his fucking cool on the field and put us a man down against a good opponent we needed to beat.

Yeah, just disregard the first half, where we played like shit. Stevie being sent off certainly hurt the team, but they were already terrible before that.

&gt;It ended because our best defender this year cost us his services for a series of game we absolutely needed him to be there for.

I don't personally think that display against Arsenal would've been much better with him in the side, seeing as Moreno, Toure and Can were all pretty below their levels. But hey, I guess one CB does a 5-man defense make!

&gt;It ended because we've got key players that were there for our run of good form injured, like Ibe and Lallana, and we're making do with people like Leiva or Toure who haven't played in weeks or are a drop down from who they are replacing.

Yep, the garbage players like Lucas and Toure. Lucas was the reason the form started to begin with. Absurd. And this game was really the first bad game of the year for Kolo. He had previously been outstanding to average. Conversely, Lallana has been inconsistent as hell, barely plays 90, and injured most of the year. Ibe was very good, but only played wing back for 3 games. Hardly the reason the team went on the run, or the reason it sustained.

&gt;It ended because Sterling or his agent decided that right in the middle of our run for the CL was the best time to 'deal with the issues' around his contract renegotiation.

This is fair enough, though Sterling has been poor finisher before that, and that was the biggest issue with him against Arsenal. He didn't play well against United, but virtually no one did.

&gt;It ended because we've got narrower pockets than our major competitors and can't afford the depth they take for granted.

This has nothing to do with the run of form. The squad is in fine shape. Yet again, we have no top quality in the side without a firing Skrtel and in-form Coutinho (who you could argue needs to have players around him doing well to truly be inform) or Sterling.

&gt;It ended because we built chemistry on the field without Sturridge, and his arrival upset the apple cart.

Don't agree on this one. The run was built around defense, not offense, and we've been wasteful without Sturridge and now with him. He was dropped against United, for fuck's sake. How can you argue shoehorning him in is what caused the end of the run of form?

&gt;It ended because we've got too many selfish players who make a good show of being team people, but who really aren't at the heart of it.

Ha, this one is an utter load of shit that you already dodged answering. The only player looking selfish is Sterling, and that's not because of what he's doing on the pitch. This is classic crticism of an English side, and it has no place in this discussion because it's just wrong.

&gt;It ended because we spent a lot of money on promise and people like Lovren or Balotelli are sitting rather than playing because they were never truly worth the cash we spent or are going to need a LOT of work to realize their potential.

This is partially fair, though people, especially here, like to gloss over the fact that we can't lure top tier talent anymore.

null,false,PhysS,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"Hi, I've written a bit in another post about the current low productivity in the British economy. 

Productivity is really just a measure of how much output do you get for your input. If I'm a farmer and I basically treat my farm as an allotment: no machines, grow a bit of everything, buy run of the mill seeds, I'm the only worker etc, then despite putting in a lot of work I'm not really going to grow more food than I need. This is low productivity farm, it does the job, I work and I get food and maybe a little bit of extra food to sell. If I now invest money in fertilizers, in buying special high yield seeds which are adapted for my environment, specialise in a certain crop which thrive in the soil and train myself in arcane farming techniques, I will get more crops and more money and the land is more profitable. Even though I have the same amount of land and I work the same hours I now make more food and make more money, this is high productivity. 

So in real life productivity can be increased due to investment by the company. Companies can invest in time-saving software/hardware, or invent more efficient methods and train their employees in new techniques. On the employee side, they can use their time more wisely (i.e don't go on Reddit at work) and learn new skills.

The problem at the moment is that Britain has fallen into low productivity rut, the productivity rate (how much output I'm getting for my input) has still not reached the pre-recession peak. Due to low productivity wage increases aren't justified (from a company's point of view) and thus we get the cost of living crisis. 

Why are we in this state? It's hard to say which is the bigger factor causing low productivity, lack investment or bad workers. I would argue it is the low investment because corporate investment has been incredibly low since the crash due to low demand and uncertainty in the future. Moreover we are seeing a problem with underemployment (people actually wanting to work more hours) which suggests that workers actually want to work. 

Why is there such low investment? Companies are finding it easier to just hire someone for minimum wage instead of investing in their current employees. This is understandable, you can fire an employee or reduce their hours but you can't get rid of the new machine / piece of software you bought to increase productivity if demand suddenly drops. Thus this is a perfectly normal phase in the economic cycle.

However, it's bad for such a period to last too long. Such low productivity jobs mean that consumers have less disposable income and will dampen domestic demand, basically the cost of living crisis. It could also lead to social issues as those employed in such jobs receive little to no training etc. and are considered expendable, thus they have no new skills and will find it hard to get anything other than a low paying job.

It's also bad for the companies, if more people are being hired to fill these jobs then the labour market will tighten (fewer unemployed people), this will produce upward pressure on wages, as it becomes harder to fill positions people can demand higher wages. Wage growth without productivity growth will begin to reduce profits. Moreover, without investment it will be harder for companies to respond to the (hopefully) inevitable increased demand and leave it vulnerable to start-ups which are more productive or offer new technologies.",null,0,null,1428440569,null,0,false,0,cq4k1jf,null,t3_31rz83,null,t1_cq4k1jf,null,t1_cq4e0ox,null,null,null,1432253744,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

So maybe I'm wrong about that - it's something I'd heard though.

Honestly, I think Gerrard didn't like Rafa because Rafa is cold and impersonal. Rodgers is infinitely better as a man manager, I think it's one of his strengths. And Gerrard said it when we came off the back of a season where we were simply incredible in an attacking sense and he got to be a deep lying midfielder, the role he says he's wanted for a long time.

I don't know if Rodgers is better or worse than Rafa, especially on last season's evidence. Like I've said in this thread, I'm mixed on Rodgers. When we're good we're really good, I think he's a great man manager and an adventurous tactician. I think he's naive at times and he and our transfer committee have left me frustrated. I think much of my gripes with him come from his inexperience and he'll probably grow as a manager as he keeps going. For me, last season was part due to Rodgers tactical flexibility (which seems to be more rigid this season) and part due to Suarez's brilliance.

I want to reiterate, I'm not advocating to see Rodgers go just because we've failed to get top 4. The only way I think he should be sacked this season is if we miss out on Europe entirely (I think we need to get the Europa League at least, not the best competition but we need practice dealing with European fixtures). I'm merely stating that if Rodgers is to go at any point, Rafa would be high up on my list of managers to bring back.

Realistically though, I don't think Rodgers will go and what makes me think that's the right decision is our turnaround in December. We played very well in a post-Suarez world. We shouldn't forget Rodgers is very young for a manager. Where I'd like to see improvements is a return to last season's tactical flexibility (but with this season's improvements in defense) and the transfer committee doing a better job at bringing in players (in my mind, a lot of our failings this season fall squarely upon the transfer committee's bad business).

TL;DR - I'm not saying Rodgers out. I believe Rodgers will grow as a manager. I just would welcome Rafa's return to the club - which is what the topic of this thread is about.",null,0,null,1428440723,null,0,false,0,cq4k57m,null,t3_31rd51,null,t1_cq4k57m,null,t1_cq4j2te,null,null,null,1432253793,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

It has been seen as a scapegoat, which has been capitalised on by other parties. I honestly believe tuition fees would be higher had there not been a coalition. However, I do feel it is a speed bump we will overcome.

A major advantage of computer-driven cars is that traffic jams and accidents will be hugely reduced. They'll be driven much more efficiently, reducing pollution, and because they'll be hundreds of times safer than human-driven vehicles, they'll be lighter, requiring less on-board safety equipment - again increasing efficiency and reducing pollution.

&gt; Consumes parking space at destination

Most self-driving car predictions I've seen have suggested that parking will be almost eliminated: the car is likely to be a subscription model, continually in use, cleaned and maintained by a private company, and after dropping you at work / the shops / school will drive off and make money from other trips. If you own your car privately, it could still do this for you, ala AirBnB. This would free up vast amounts of town-centre real estate for more productive use.

Overall, that's vastly more efficient than today as well: there will be fewer cars in the world, requiring fewer resources to be made, and taking up less space, unused in driveways and garages, for [95% of their lives](http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html).

The Lib Dems would be the party I'm closest to in the British Isles, quite a shame we don't have a liberal party over here.

Anyway, Trident caused some commotion in the Lib Dems over the last few years. In light of Russian aggression of late, do you feel that a strong nuclear deterrent is necessary, as opposed to the slimmed down alternative (or simply none) many in the Lib Dems want?

Defence spending also is facing more cuts. What level of spending would the Lib Dems be prepared to support?

Many Lib Dems voted against intervening in Syria in 2013 - collapsing the Franco-US effort to prevent Assad using WMDs. What sort of intervention do you feel is justifiable?

Climate change seems to have fallen off the agenda of late. Subsidies are all well and good, however wouldn't increasing taxation on fossil fuels have economic benefits (such taxes are nowhere near as damaging as income tax/VAT and would reduce the deficit)? Do you feel that such measures are being avoided for fear of antagonising the electorate?

EDIT: Radical Islam is becoming an increasing problem. While poverty and such is an issue, many of those involved are quite well off (the leader of the Kenyan attack was a lawyer). While helping states abroad fight it militarily is all well and good, how does Europe fight it at home, when so many of our Muslim citizens hold regressive views (on homosexuality, apostasy, women's rights etc), despite being in our education system?

The Neath Port Talbot council are constantly cutting Neath's funding- even cut the Christmas lights last year- certainly not okay, and needs some rejigging in terms of monetary allocation. 

Neath has nowhere near enough homeless facilities, meaning that those who find themselves in the situation none of us want to be in, they have to gravitate toward Swansea, and the homeless services are already stretched in Swansea, so people aren't getting the help they need.

Is it easy to survive with few GSCEs? Yes and no. You will get a minimum wage job which will do you OK while you're young and very poorly while you're older. You will probably never buy a house, and you will struggle to provide for your family. However there are many options so long as you're willing to train and put in some effort. You could go the route I went, or you could become an apprentice and get yourself a good trade which will set you up for life to always have something to fall back on which will pay well. There are many options. If you're still at school, do not leave school. If you've screwed up your GSCE's then figure out how you can do your A-levels anyway and do them, work hard, and get what you can. If you've already left school, look into the options with regards to apprenticeships and adult colleges and figure out which appeal to you and then look into how to become enrolled, what financial support is available to you, and accept that you may have to go through a few financially tough years to get your qualifications but that it **will** be worth it in the end.

Bentekkers won us the point nice to see him back on form. 

Gabby I honestly thought he got subbed at half time for a while. 

Grealish looked alright, some great touches and movement in the first half, but I'm not sure playing youth at this stage is a great idea. 2nd half he looked a little lost and pointing to give the ball to his feet a lot when he was tightly marked or in the way of his own player, not really what you want to be doing in the prem find better space and the ball will come. Controversial I know as you all love him a lot.

It's the second half, I'm hungry, and my wallet is in my coat pocket, but unfortunately, my coat sleeve is trapped by the guy sitting in front of me, and of course I'm far too British to politely ask him to move forward. Eventually he leans forward when we're on the break, and I swiftly move down the steps to get a quick snack. Now, as luck would have it, we score a goal as I get to the bottom of the steps... 

""Get in!"" I scream, we've gone 3-1 up! I jump for joy, smiling at the stewards, who look on at me with stern, cold faces. I soon realise... The food stalls are shut. 'Why on earth is he getting food?' they must have been wondering. I don't want to look stupid, so I go into the toilet to play it cool. After one of the happiest wee wees I've had in a long time, I come out to be greeted by an elderly Villa fan ""It's ridiculous, isn't it?"" he says ""They've gone and bloody scored."" 

I'm annoyed, of course, but we're still 3-2 up! Come on, Villa! And this, ladies and gentlemen, is where my story takes a sorry turn. 
Coming out of the stairway, I realise my error... It was Q.P.R's goal, we'd switched ends! JamMasterJai, you fool! I quickly tell the stewards I'm so sorry for celebrating, I got it wrong. Don't kick me out. Well, they must have been wondering what on God's earth I was talking about, because I had come out of the wrong stairway... 

Don't worry, I'll play it cool and walk up and across. You can't walk across, JamMasterJai. I quickly retreat back down the stair,  mortified I'd got everything so wrong. I did eventually make my way back to my seat, wishing for a hole to just open up beneath me. Then they scored again. I'd gone from being 3-1 up to 3-2 down...

Hint: the quality of the individual players is less relevant than consistent play and playing together to build chemistry.  You can't take someone out that's playing regularly without a disruption.  You can't add a player back in that hasn't been playing without a similar disruption.  You can't slot from playing with a national team back into LFC without a disruption. You can't slot in from multiple games on the bench without a disruption.  You can't have selfish behaviour like Balotelli or Sterling off field without a disruption.  You can't have your captain lose his shit without a disruption.  You can't move someone from striker to winger without a disruption.

It all adds up, even if everyone's a quality player.  It's the sheer volume of changes that add up to killing momentum and locker room chemistry.

Serious question - Why?

For me, a school should be a level playing field where there is an absolute separation between education and religion. Religion should be present within the bounds of educational RE lessons and practice if required (such as daily worship).

There have been faith schools established that have vegetarianism as a condition of entry. With the parents choosing where their children attend, as you rightly point out, children are being locked into a parental view of what they should conform to from a very young age. There have been many critical reports of this approach, including discrimination conditions that has been legalised for faith schools.

I do not feel like this is a correct environment for children to learn in.

&gt;Grealish looked alright, some great touches and movement in the first half, but I'm not sure playing youth at this stage is a great idea. 2nd half he looked a little lost and pointing to give the ball to his feet a lot when he was tightly marked or in the way of his own player, not really what you want to be doing in the prem find better space and the ball will come.

Here I'll have to disagree he took the ball while tightly marked multiple times and pulled off some outstanding first touch passes and created good chances from seemingly nothing.

1. You do not believe there is no God.     
2. You do not believe there is a God.    

Whereas you think an atheist would be:

1. You do believe there is not a God.    
2. You do not believe there is a God.   

And a theist:

1. You do not believe there is not a God.     
2. You do believe there is a God.      

The important difference between believing there is not something, and not believing there is something. Just because of the stigma around these words there can be a real reliance on the labels rather than the underlying beliefs, I've heard of lots of self-proclaimed atheist who would fall under the first category for example, and where I say God I mean god(s) or any supernatural entity that created the universe (or however you would define a deity).

Every agent and top player worth his salt will have an eye on that situation as it will likely turn around in the near future. 

Football is so different though. A 50% success rate on transfers is considered to be very good indeed and while you can try to overpay for proven talent even that's not a guarantee of anything. Look at United, they broke the bank for Di Maria and he's been average at best.

I know that at university, the veiled girls normally stick to themselves, and it's quite a similar story when I see people in public as well. Whether this is acceptable is a question of how segregated we want our society to be. Segregated minorities are not necessarily a bad thing. Jews are an example, who remain a sort of segregated community despite holding many of the same values as mainstream british society. However I think segregation of muslim communities is a more pressing issue simply because of their growing demographics, meaning that lack of integration allows birth rates to stay high.

What are you talking about?  If she'd said she didn't want further cuts that perfectly fits what I'm describing and absolutely doesn't imply that she believes all cuts to date are wrong!  

That's literally what further means!  It's right there in the definition you gave.

further cuts == additional cuts  == more cuts

&gt;Your taxes analogy is just more misdirection. Taxes are an implied part of living in a modern nation state. 

And that changes your definition of the word 'more'?!

&gt;Austerity is a supposedly short-term measure. The two carry vastly different implications, and your analogy only serves to highlight your ignorance.

Ignorance of what, exactly?  And you're essentially admitting here that your preconceptions and personal feelings about austerity led you to misinterpret basic English because if you'd have considered some measure of austerity in the face of massive shortfalls in revenue inevitable and implied (and some measure of austerity is supported by all three parties), you wouldn't have had difficulty understanding the words before you.

You're getting very aggressive about this, and it's quite a bizarre display because the person who wrote the sentence has already been perfectly clear about what she meant. You'd rather pretend that she completely changed her mind after 30 seconds than admit that you might have been wrong in your knee-jerk response.


The only ignorance about politics is yours.  The fact is that all three UK parties:

a) want to decrease the deficit

b) do not want to decrease the deficit straight away and will happily borrow additional tens of billions each year to graduate the negative effects of austerity

Despite any of the rhetoric, any differences between the parties are really just a measure of degrees of where they place the balance between a and b.  George Osborne is spending money he doesn't have and has borrowed hundreds of billions of pounds because he believes that cutting too fast would damage the economy.  Labour already had plans for massive spending cuts which they'd have enacted if they'd have won in 2010.  Cameron pledged to match Labour spending in the 2000s that he now says bankrupted the country.  Try to look beyond the fluff.  That's the reality of British politics.

He had a good game but I'm a big fan of using the old guard when it comes relegation fights, he's young and deserves his chance in games but I'd rather see him starting against City when he might do something outstanding with the odds against us rather than a tight QPR battle where 3 points is a must.

Fair enough and I would definitely agree with you if we had a good enough amount of old guard that weren't injured. I would have picked a better time to give him his start too but I think he did well all things considered.

&gt;I'd also prefer it if he didn't walk around flicking his hair about so much with his socks round his ankles. 

Who cares? He was probably nervous as fuck.

&gt;But if he bulks up over summer he's got potential to be an outstanding player.

Definitely agree here, if he can put on some muscle he has got the quality to be a mainstay of our first 11 for a long time once he gets some experience.

&gt;The rule is exploited by jet-setters and wealthy business executives to pick and choose the least fiscally burdensome domicile while continuing to enjoy the right to reside and work in Britain. Their numbers have been rising: from 83,000 in 1997 to 116,000 in 2013. Some, such as foreigners temporarily resident in Britain for work, may have a case for doing so. Far more dubious are cases where the individual is a long-term UK resident, or a British citizen who has elected — either through inheritance or from choice — to domicile themselves in a low-tax country.

&gt;...

&gt;It is hard to know how much the Treasury is losing out. There are no reliable figures for tax foregone. But the inherent unfairness of allowing the richest in society to avoid paying their fair share of tax has become a matter of fierce public irritation. 

&gt;...

&gt;Those who defend the status quo argue it promotes inward investment because wealthy non-doms build up assets in the UK simply by being here. Were it scrapped, they say, these individuals would leave, taking their enterprise and what UK tax they pay.

&gt;But in reality non-doms have few incentives to engage in UK activity. The chancellor George Osborne may have introduced measures to encourage them to remit from abroad to invest. But for the most part bringing offshore cash into Britain simply ensures that it will be taxed at UK rates.

&gt;As for the idea that abolition will trigger a flood of non-doms seeking sanctuary in Switzerland, some footloose individuals may leave. But the many advantages of London as a financial centre do not dissolve simply because of a change in a hitherto generous tax treatment of resident non domiciles. Low-tax cantons cannot match the City’s deep pool of financial expertise or the excitement of London life.

&gt;...

&gt;Britain should sweep away the archaism that allows people to claim a domicile that differs from nationality or residence. Few other civilised countries feel the need to offer such privileges to the wealthy. Liability to taxation should be solely based on residence. There can still be a grace period for foreign nationals posted temporarily to the UK before they are obliged to pay British tax.

&gt;More than two centuries after the introduction of income tax by Mr Pitt, his successors should end the egregious situation where the wealthiest enjoy the privileges of UK residency without paying their fair dues to the exchequer.

Too many people forget where we were a decade ago: often close to administration, often close to relegation, poor attendances, buying journeymen for huge fees, getting deeper into the hole with every passing year. It reminds me of a time I was mortally pished at the casino on payday, having no inhibition, placing bets everywhere, yet there was a nagging voice in the back of my head asking: 'Wait, have you paid the rent yet?'

The late Eddie Thompson's largesse was a fun ride at times, but it was also a Rangers-lite rollercoaster of debt.

His son has steadied the ship and got us close to being debt free. The man should be lauded for doing what he has done. The idea that the guy is doing it all for profit is frankly absurd. He and his family, lifelong United fans, have pumped money into the club that they are never going to get back. 

Our club has a long term plan to rid us of debt. I hope what follows after that accomplishment is regular profit, more and more youth development leading to a day we can afford to keep and pay promising players, qualifying for Europe regularly, eventually challenging for the title, actually doing well in Europe, etc etc.

If any fans think we can do this by going back to the spend spend spend of the late nineties and early 2000s they are more naive than I thought.

I hope 2-5 years from now we can look back on periods like this as the necessary hard times to get us to stability and endless ambition.

Or maybe I should jump on this miserable prevading attitude of 'dinnae sell GMS and Armstrong, we can win the league cup!'

I don't give TWO FUCKS about the League Cup. I care about doing well for years to come. If anyone wants to tell me I care more about money than results, then get in the queue, because short-term - you're probably right, but a long term strategy could get us big European nights again (and blackjack, cocaine and classy hookers) before the decade is through.... and i'm a patient guy.",null,0,null,1428448822,null,0,1428449036,0,cq4p4qn,null,t3_31qi1a,null,t1_cq4p4qn,null,t3_31qi1a,null,null,null,1432256213,null,3,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,3,null

A new manager could launch Liverpool into a glorious series of league winning or they could fail abysmally.

Someone that has the potential to form a great partnership with Zouma for years to come. A player like John Stones would have been my ideal candidate. Him being English is a plus too with the FA rules regarding homegrown changing on yearly basis. You should also consider the way JT has been playing since last season. I believe he is the best center back in the world at the moment. No other CB has been consistently playing at their very best this season. I won't shocked, if he keeps on playing this good for two more seasons. The fact that he retired from England would increase the chances of him playing until he is in his late 30's. For that reason alone, i would be against us signing a defender like Matt Hummels. His presence won't drastically change our team for the better. We are already solid at defending. Cahill and Zouma can rotate to partner JT while we keep on searching for another talented defender to partner Zouma in the future. I know a lot of fans here want us to sign Varane, but i am hoping that defender would be John Stones. The only other French player that might be vital to our team is Pogba and that is a different story. My wish list for next season is Pogba and Stones. We can even loan John Stones back to Everton(i don't think they will sell him though)

&gt; George Osborne has tinkered with the non-dom system by increasing the annual fees on those who are granted non-dom status, but Labour claims the rules are shot through with anomalies.

&gt; In effect, Miliband is criticising the previous Labour government that allowed the number of non-doms to swell until it introduced a rule in 2008 requiring non-doms to pay an annual fee.

&gt; Someone who is a non-dom and lives in the UK for less than seven years can currently use the special non-dom rules free of any charge.

If you continue watching the show thinking it's going to be similar style and characterization to Blink, you're going to be disappointed. Here's a few I think are good to get a decent idea of what the show is about (in no particular order):

- Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead: Epic, fast-paced, creepy. A lot of character development and sets up a lot of Modern Who lore!

- Dalek: Reveals a lot about the show and The Doctor himself, as well as the best writing of the Daleks since 2005 

- Human Nature/The Family of Blood: A very unique Who story but it  tells a lot about The Doctor's character and it's pretty damn epic.

- The Eleventh Hour: If you're going to a Doctor Who themed wedding, there's probably going to be a lot of bow ties, it's best you learn where that originated!

- The Day of the Doctor: A good stepping on point for new Who fans, and explains A LOT about all of modern Doctor Who. And it's brilliant and exciting and shows the scale of 50 years of this show.

- Gridlock: An example of the brilliant characterisation that makes the show what it is! Also The Doctor saves the day - it doesn't get any more Who than that!

(It's good to get a regeneration story in!) - Parting of the Ways: It's a pretty simple episode, compared to the other two regeneration stories in modern Who. It's good!

And finally, to truly get an idea of what Doctor Who is about, you have to look at both ends of the spectrum:

- Love and Monsters: It's really not as bad as the internet says it is. It is, however, ridiculous, but the human characters are brilliantly realised and, although very Doctor-light, it shows you how mental and eccentric (and sometimes terrible) the show can be!

So the fall occurred before the tuition fees vote even occurred, the problem is the tuition fees vote consolidated the message, there was no chance of recovery after that, making a stagnant tory government isn't a problem if you fight for your voice to be heard. The only times the Lib Dems did that was to push through a vote that was never going to pass and largely no one really cared about. Not for any issue that majority of people understood, like money, for higher education. 

The real question is do the Lib Dems recover if they voted against the tuition fees raise, do they call the tory bluff that the coalition falls apart at that point, and does it matter if it did? If the Lib Dems get so little out of a coalition (other than losing all support for them) why keep it, I really can't fathom the strategists and spin doctors thought process over this issue, it is like they couldn't fathom that life isn't just about the next 3 years of government, they couldn't fathom that they had pulled the swing vote, a pool that if your word doesn't meet your actions is inherently going to do what it does best, swing to another party. The facts are the conservatives could do very little without the Lib Dems, and they created a majority with them, the Lib Dems have the leverage in this position, because they never had anything to lose, unless you start voting through conservative mantras completely against your whole ideals. 

If the conservatives can't live with only passing moderations of their policies then they don't get passed at all, the tuition fee rise was no where near a moderate policy, it was the opposite of the Lib Dems campaign message, the exact campaign message of the conservatives and makes people pay money directly, in their face, no sneeky taxation like raising VAT from 17.5% to 20%, nope, just here is your bill for £6K more each year, oh and you want a job when you finish, tough luck the economies still screwed.",null,0,null,1428450675,null,0,false,0,cq4q9h0,null,t3_31s9be,null,t1_cq4q9h0,null,t1_cq4oqq4,null,null,null,1432256746,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

First of all, satnavs don't ever measure your speed, they only measure the time, very very accurately. By comparing time signals between different satellites* they can calculate your position. They then calculate your speed based on how much your position changes over time.

Second, while the time signal is pretty much guaranteed to be bang on for the purposes of knowing how fast you're going (the odd hundred nanoseconds of jitter here and there can be ignored when your sample rate is well over a million times slower and you want a value in miles per hour), the derived position data can be a bit noisy, mostly because of signals being reflected off buildings, bridges, mountains, other cars and the like. A reflection that adds 100 nanoseconds will introduce up to 30m of noise to the position. Over time that noise averages out and so *on average* the position data is also pretty much bang on, but you need to sample several times to get an accurate position.

Typical consumer devices apparently sample your position between 1 and 10 times a second. Given how noisy the signal can be it makes sense to use an average position from 5 or so samples to figure out your actual position. And you need two such averages, using samples that don't overlap, if you want to calculate a speed. So the speed displayed on your satnav will be accurate if you're going at constant speed, but it will lag behind your actual speed whenever you change speed. Slam the brakes on or floor it and it'll take a bit of time to notice.

The more you spend on the GPS module the more accurate you'll get as it'll be able to track more satellites, and this will also vary with where the GPS receiver/antenna is mounted. In a typical Tomtom-a-like system, the GPS module is whatever was cheapest on Alibaba that week because saving a few pennies really matters when you manufacture hundreds of thousands of devices, and the receiver and its aerial are inside a metal box with a limited view of the sky. If you use a phone as your satnav then the GPS module is even cheaper and nastier, and has been optimised for low power usage (ie low sample rate) as opposed to speed and accuracy. The sampling rate varies from model to model, but on an iPhone 4, for example, it can apparently be as low as 1 Hz when working on battery power**.

You can get much more accurate portable GPS devices, of course, which sample more often, are better at ignoring spurious signals, can listen to more satellites and so on. If you try to shop online for stuff like that it's usually ""please call for a quote"", but you're looking at somewhere in the region of a coupla grand. Look for manufacturers like Trimble and Leica.

Each political party is governed, whether we like it or not, by a set of values and beliefs of how to govern a country and the societies and communities within said country. Some parties have more working class values and others more higher class values. It gets more complicated but you get the picture.

Let's say, for instance, that she didn't join the Liberal Democrats. That no one did. Under your logic, due to the mistake of voting tuition fees to rise, anyone new joining them would be implicitly approving. Thus, because of this one mistake, the entire party should simply crumble. This is ridiculous.

Change happens from doing things. Things, my friend, can not be done by being idle, or throwing a tantrum. Things need to be changed from within. There is a sub-culture within parties and amongst the different constituencies. Perhaps there needs to be a change there? 

It's extraordinarily naive to allow a mistake such as this to assume this is the collective thought of Liberal Democrats. Not as the people who *currently* make up the party, but the party as it stands for. Being Liberal and all that.

Regardless of the horrible decision that has (by the way) negatively affected me forever, I still favour the ideas and values of the Lib Dems. I understand the face of each and every party changes all the time. Labour and Iraq, Lib Dems and Tuitions, Tories and Bedroom tax... there will always be something. Whether it's a promise or not. 

It's less about representing individuals (whom you can't choose) and more the manifesto your party is drawing together and the values the party believe in. And wriggling out problems that, unfortunately, will always be a trademark to politics. Especially in Britain.

Why is this the case, because top universities aren't aiming to train the middle workers, they are aiming to train the top class, the problem with this is that 70% of that degree in take aren't the top class and they need to be skilled across the board, 30% if that will be the ones taken up by the employers, more in subjects like engineering, but way less in ones like Psychology or Biological sciences.

For example, the Tories closing down mines and privatising government businesses - BT, Royal Mail, British Rail - all had fairly sound *theoretical* backing from an economics point of view - the introduction of the profit motive should in theory have meant these private companies would compete harder with private and foreign competition to cut waste and promote efficiency, prices would fall, and consumers are better off.

However, in the mines example, they didn't consider the problem of structural unemployment - closing down mines created high unemployment and gutted towns across the country, which never quite recovered. So instead of the theory, which stated that supporting loss-making industries was a welfare loss to society and supported their privatisation to improve the quantity and quality of their output, we got the reality, where industries just collapsed and everybody was worse off as a result.

NB I don't actually know much about mines it was just an example of how economic theory and reality aren't always the same thing",null,0,null,1428453070,null,0,false,0,cq4rpme,null,t3_31s9be,null,t1_cq4rpme,null,t1_cq4p5xu,null,null,null,1432257429,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Oxford Tube costs about £15-17 (last time I checked), goes from Victoria station (or try Marble Arch) and will get you to Oxford in 1.5-2 hours. Get off at St Clements or High Street for Magdalen, which is then a 5 minute walk. I'm a Magdalen student.

The train goes from Paddington and will get you to Oxford in 1 hour, but then you'll have to walk or take a bus (buses are not as frequent as I'd like them to be and wait around a lot, so it's often faster to walk). Walk will take maximum of half an hour to Magdalen. It is slightly more expensive, and given you don't have a railcard this will be about £24. There will be fast trains and slow trains, so make sure your train only stops at 3-4 stops (e.g. Slough, Reading, Oxford). Download the National Rail app on your phone for train times, if you can.

Finally, if you find somewhere to keep your bags near Heathrow which might be cheaper, there is the OXF bus from Heathrow Central Bus Station (near terminals 1-3), but this is expensive than the Oxf tube - similar to the train - but will get you there pretty sharpish, in about 1 hour 10 minutes. They leave every 20-30 minutes, and will also stop at St Clements and the High Street for close access to Magdalen.

&gt;___The League of Gentlemen___ is a quartet of [British dark comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_dark_comedy) writer–performers, formed in 1995 by [Jeremy Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Dyson), [Mark Gatiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gatiss), [Steve Pemberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pemberton) and [Reece Shearsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_Shearsmith). The [television programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_programme) for which they are best known, although officially labelled a [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom), was initially more [sketch-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_show), linked together by their common setting: the fictional [village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village) of [Royston Vasey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royston_Vasey), based on the town of [Alston, Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alston,_Cumbria) and set somewhere in the north of England.  The show contains elements of [horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film). The first series aired on [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) in 1999 and follows the lives of dozens of the town's bizarre [inhabitants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_League_of_Gentlemen), played by Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith in a number of guises and make-up. The television series was filmed mainly in [Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadfield,_Derbyshire) but also features [Glossop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossop), [Gamesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamesley), [Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden,_West_Yorkshire), [Mottram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottram), [Hope Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Valley,_Derbyshire) (Derbyshire) and [Todmorden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todmorden).

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"They didn't compromise though, they pushed through a few of their policies that no one cared about, had a vote no one cared about, then pushed through a load of conservative policy, a lot which people didn't care about, but some which they did. 

The conservative couldn't pass this policy without the Lib Dems, essentially the Lib Dems passed it as the Conservatives were always voting for it, the Lib Dems were the relevant votes. If they don't vote it doesn't get passed. If there is no deal it doesn't get passed either, the Lib Dem voters only lose if it does get passed, and the fact that Lib Dems in power didn't rebel against their party and not vote for it, because by rebelling they were actually not only supporting their parties policies, but also supporting the electorate who voted them into power, means that they don't deserve to get any votes again. 

Lets put it this way, the voters voted for a Lib Dem candidate to vote on the principles of the Lib Dem campaign in government, that is how it works, each MP represents their constituents who have voted for them because they agree with them, hence they sit there. If they aren't going to vote on the principles of that campaign, in fact even worse, they are going to vote in the opposite manner, then what was the point in you voting for them in the first place? 

That is the crux of the matter, every Lib Dem in that house should have said, No, I am going to rebel against the party line on this issue (and actually support the principles of the Lib Dem campaign philosophy (can't even do rebelling right, silly Lib Dems)), because this party line wasn't the party line that the electorate voted me in to support and there have been no exemplary circumstance that have occurred to make me feel like their opinions have changed on this issue.

Not to say that you're necessarily wrong, but observing the relative frequency with which others speed while travelling the same direction as you is very deceptive: if only 50% of drivers speed by 50% (e.g 60mph in a 40mph limit), and you're doing the speed limit, you will feel like you see a *lot* more than 50% of the drivers you see overtaking you! This is because the 50% of drivers who are going close to the same speed as you (around 40mph) stay the same distance away from you (ahead of behind) and so you never see them. Bit those going significantly faster (around 60mph) will *keep* overtaking you, and you'll keep overtaking those that go much slower (around 30mph, but these are much rarer).

IMO the trend was set the moment the club introduced the platinum and gold scheme. Effectively a way for the club to put a price on loyalty.

They undermined the loyalty point system entirely and demonstrated how little they thought of us, or our loyalty. To think they thought we were all stupid enough to not know that it was an enforced increase on top of the default increases, with everyone concerned about their points.

That was the beginning of the divide and conquer.

It it's hyperbole either, it's precisely the contempt shown to supporters that we used to deride United for.

Now, City have had increases every single season for about 8 years while United have frozen theirs for 4. Now, a season ticket in the lower Stretford End will set you back £532, while an equivalent at City in the lower South Stand will set you back £600 - £650 if you need platinum.

If you're travelling trains on consecutive days, follow /u/itsalllies advice and get a [Britrail GB consecutive pass](http://www.visitbritainshop.com/world/travel-transport/rail-tickets/product/britrail-gb-consecutive-pass.html), otherwise go for a [Britrail flexipass](http://www.visitbritainshop.com/world/travel-transport/rail-tickets/product/britrail-gb-flexi-pass.html) because it's cheaper. If you do go for this route, make sure you buy it in advance. See the [main Britrail](http://www.britrail.com) website for more information.

If you don't want a rail pass but still want to train it, then avoid peak hours to save money. You'll need to check the train operator for specific peak hours but [National Rail](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk) is a good starter.

Ireland luckily has a [one-country Eurail pass](http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/one-country-pass/ireland) which covers Northern Ireland as well.

Whilst in London, get an [Oyster card](https://account.tfl.gov.uk/oyster) for public transport and download [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com). Personally, if you're healthy enough, try walking around instead, you'll see much more.

If you book it in advance, [Ryanair](http://www.ryanair.com) and [Easyjet](http://www.easyjet.com/) can offer you cheap plane trips. However, if you're carrying loads of stuff, this will not be for you as they make money off baggage fees.

To break up the monotony of travelling, you could also consider [ferrying](http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferries-to-ireland) across the [sea](http://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/to-britain-from-ireland/).

**EDIT: Its not just the quarter, it can be the full year's worth!**

* If you don't pay that then they get the baliffs on you who can charge:

Of course all councils and most baliffs are happy for you to pay in smaller chunks or arrange payment at a later date but if you can't pay in a ""satisfactory"" amount of time these fees compound upon an existing debt and make it much harder to pay. This friend of mine ended up having to pay double the original debt just in these fees.

For the most part, our front four switch positions fairly often. Not permanently, but if one player moves into another area, the others readjust to fill the holes. The formation is always the same, and no matter who starts where the gameplan is always the same. Thats Poch's thing. The only difference is where he is when he gets the ball. When Eriksen starts on the left, his direct contributions (goals/assists) usually come when he switches to the middle and attacks from there. The difference is that the realignment of our attack momentarily throws defenses off. This means that when Eriksen starts in the middle he has to move away from there when they switch, putting him in worse positions.

The fact that as an influencing force in UK politics, a part of the majority, no one can name anything they did that was good, is firstly a PR disaster for them, I mean really, their whole spin team need to be fired, and secondly is just embarrassing, people can name the things that the majority government does, I can't name anything that as a part of the majority government the Lib Dems did that was true to their campaign promises, other than get a referendum on an election issue that no one really cared that much about, no one really understood, and the campaign for it to change was once again disastrous.

But it could have easily fit in to the story if they had revealed that Missy had ""promised"" Earth to legions of robotic life while making a pact with the Cybermen.

Then when Danny sacrifices himself to go self destruct and wipe out the army we could have Clara break down (why she goes from fighting for Danny's life to going ""oh the clouds are gone"" is beyond me) and have the audience (but not the Doctor) find out she is pregnant in a flash back to just before she called Danny at the start of Dark Water thereby tying up the Orson Pink issue from Listen, giving more weight to the Doctor's statement that she was a ""mess of chemicals"" and giving her more reason to lie during the cafe scene. Then actually let that be the end of her story. 

Simple things like this could have made the finale really really memorable, all the material is there but it's just not quite happening for some reason.

Think, Amy and Rory could have been seperated forever, leading Amy to never forgive the Doctor and leave him, this would be far more dramatic then oh well they're gone but they lived happily ever after after they left!

Clara could have died by saving the doctor for S7. This would add a whole new dimension to the Doctor, as he would end up forgiving himself for saving Gallifrey soon after (which btw I also think is a terrible plot development), but would not be able to get over the fact he let his companion come to harm. 

Even River Song could have truly died for the Doctor, but nope, she'll ""live"" happily ever after as computer data in a Utopic world.

Compare with RTD, who had much more variation:

Rose: She did not die, but the Doctor lost her, and eventually chose to say goodbye and leave her in my favourite scene in the entire series.

Martha: A successful companion, left on good terms, became strong and independent.

Donna: The saddest ending imo. This character development was just beautiful to watch.

This season, the reaction towards him is especially bad because offensively he makes the wrong decision too often and he starts most of the time, although I think he hasn't been our worst performer. The reason he starts more than Milner and Nasri is because he is great at tracking back and defending counterattacks. He works as hard as Milner, but has pace too.

The fact that no one at all could come up with a reason to actually vote for them just solidifies my thoughts, one person came and said, because they might get in power, that isn't a reason, that isn't a policy, a stand point, they are just words.

Labours policies often aren't based on logic and quantitative evidence, for instance there oh so famous 50% tax, this has been shown through proper statistical methods of real world data to lead to the rich paying less tax, because they actively avoid it, whereas the 45% tax rate is low enough that they can't or it is too much effort to actively avoid it. 

The exact same thing could quite easily happen in this case, with all the non-doms who say they are going to leave, actually leaving, and taking all their money with them, once again it would make the UK worse off. Labour seems to have an obsession with punchy headlines while ignoring hard statistical facts. But the people voting them are apparently too stupid to notice, I mean what other conclusion can you come to, that they know this and are all just playing along with the charade, not so much. I am not going to claim the conservatives are any better, everyone knows whatever they say actually their economic policies are just going to make the rich better off, but labour, their economic polices aren't making the poor better off or the rich worse off, they are just pure illusionist propaganda. Why are people voting for that? They were once the party of the unions, the unions are dead, they died long ago, how are they still relevant?

Navas hasn't changed since last year, he was lethal because we played fast on the transition and he'd get the ball on the halfway line with a spread out back line and loads of room to run into. This season, by the time he gets the ball -usually on the edge of the area -there's already 8 men in the box and there is literally nothing on except a hopeful cross. 

He gets asked to do an impossible job, no one can find Aguero in the air in a box full of defenders and Yaya was so shit he usually had no options on the edge of the box. His only option is to try and get a cross in, or pass it back to Sagna or Yaya. And despite this impossible job of trying to put crosses in to a 5'8 striker, on Monday there were still usually 4 or 5 absolute beauties that fizzed across the six yard box begging to be tapped in, and no one was there to do it. Ageuro was dropping deep because Dzeko was getting in his way in the box and Dzeko couldn't be bothered to make the run. Most of them went straight through to Clichy on the other side of the pitch.

This was not the kind of game Navas should have played, but he had to because Milner dropped out of the England squad injured and obviously wasn't fully fit, Jovetic is on the naughty step, and Nasri has apparently had a bust up with Pellegrini, as well as the fact he refuses to defend and would have left Sagna exposed against Palace's best player, Bolasie.

 Anyone who thinks Navas is our problem has it backwards IMO - he's a perfectly good squad player, but he's only become a starting player because everyone else has been so embarrassingly poor, lazy, and sometimes injured.

Treat the trial lesson as a trial to see if you actually enjoy flying - but also as the first lesson, where you will learn the basics. If possible, visit the club first (a bad weather day is best, because the aircraft and instructors will be on the ground), and have a chat with them to make sure you like the general feel of the place.

null,false,a_curly_backflip,null,null,null,"While MDMA is a substituted amphetamine, the differences between it and amphetamine proper make it less likely to become addictive, although as you rightly say any substance can potentially cause psychological dependence. There have only been a few studies done on MDMA addiction, none of them thorough enough to merit citing. Numbers entering treatment are low however, and while that doesn't tell us everything it's a good indicator.

The fact that MDMA has a reasonably long half life, is usually swallowed, and builds tolerance quickly seem to be the main reasons for the disparity in addiction between it and other amphetamines. Without the compulsion to redose regularly, there's less likelihood of habit forming. The setting in which it is usually used also tends it to be associated with social gatherings, so again, it's not developing associations that are tied into habitual use. Speed use on the other hand often spills into every day use, as the lack of apparent emotional change brought about by the drug makes it tempting to use for work, waking up, cleaning the house etc - once you get into those patterns it's easy to see where problems can occur.

There are plenty of people who have used MDMA in a way which has caused problems for them though, and who have required treatment. It certainly can be a substance of dependence to some. Relatively speaking though, it's just a lot less common than with other amphetamines.

Childs also makes the very valid point that treatment of HIV is more cost effective than non-treatment. 

And finally Childs also points out that one in four HIV+ people doesn't even know they have the virus. Now you could go and test every immigrant but I reckon most people would object to such a thing.

I'd quite ~~respectively~~ respectfully suggest that there are more arguments in favour of treating HIV+ immigrants than not treating them. Besides, there are better reasons for turning people away.

I understand this is because politics is often about ""appealing to voters"", I just think that it's possible to do that without treating them like they've got nothing but wet sponge between their ears.
  
Anyway.  
  
I think there are some interesting recommendations here although I think that point #1 is bound to fail as in my 45 years on God's good earth I have yet to understand exactly what it is Parliament does other than generate laws that are not enforced, leading to calls for further laws (that are not enforced), and so on. Also there's some stuff about them ""running the country"" which has to be some of the most self-important and deluded nonsense I believe I have ever heard.

Taking the questions seriously for a second though:

1. Part of the problem here isn't Parliament per se, but the fact that some of the things Parliament discusses are esoteric, or not obviously connected to every day life, are often quite involved, take time to follow and are subject to change with a change of government. I remember studying philosophy and there was a point - some time during year 2 of the course - where I thought something to the effect of: ""These arguments never actually stop, do they? It's almost like people have a vested interest in not coming to a decision. Blimey. I'm actually finding this quite tedious. I think I should have done a music degree instead"". I expect this is most people's reaction to political discussions lasting longer than a few minutes at a time (minus the desire to do a music degree).

2. I like the idea of submitting questions electronically, but don't we already [have a system](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) that allows us to do this that are already largely ignored? If that's the case then perhaps the problem has less to do with participation and more to do with the brains of the petition recipients?

3. Sounds like a good idea in principle, but the devil's in the details. ""There will now be a recess while Mr. Dimgarble from Plim gets on his hobby-horse and rides it around for a good 10 minutes, setting the world to rights"". I'm all for discussion, but in a debate where you're going to take some actual action (rather than just chew the fat) there has to be some method of distinguishing arguments that are just noise from arguments based on fact, experience, judgement, study and so on. So yeah, in principle sounds ok - in practice it sounds like a fucking nightmare council meeting where everyone has a say and nothing ever gets done. Not, of course, that ""doing things"" is necessarily always the object of government, just that a government that never does anything ... hang on, maybe that's the point ... ah, clever Mr. Bercow ...

4. I expect discussions of this will generate further traffic to [Tom Scott's rather partisan video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI), the gist of which is ""There are many problems with electronic voting, so we shouldn't do it"". (This is the same reason why man has never set foot on the moon. No, wait ... ). My pov is that there are bound to be problems, but life is usually about choosing which set of problems you wish to afflict you, rather than determining which course of action leads to no problems whatsoever. I fall into the ""well we're going to need to try this sooner or later, so let's just get it over and done with"" camp.

Besides bulking up slightly towards the end of his career at Chels and somewhat improving his positional play, other aspects of his game never really developed and he left much to be desired. He was always one of my favourite players to watch though cause when he got the ball you felt like something might happen. I think he's somewhere in the lower leagues now,

A speedo must never show less than the actual speed, and must never show more than 110% of actual speed + 6.25mph.  So if your true speed is 40mph, your speedo could legally be reading up to 50.25mph but never less than 40mph.  Or to put it another way, if your speedo is reading 50mph, you won’t be doing more than 50mph but it’s possible you might actually only be travelling at 40mph.
&gt; 
&gt; To ensure that they comply with the law and make sure that their speedometers are never showing less than true speed under any foreseeable circumstances, car manufacturers will normally deliberately calibrate their speedos to read ‘high’ by a certain amount.  As your satnav is not the designated device by which a car’s speed is measured, it does not need to incorporate any fudge factoring.

Is that route in order? Just because for ease - if you're coming from Liverpool and going to Wales - I'd do this:

* fly Liverpool-Belfast
* Belfast-Galway
* Galway-Dingle
* Dingle-Dublin (though there are some places in between you could stop like Cork and Wexford)
* Dublin-Wales

That gives you [this](https://goo.gl/maps/4kIWt) sort of route.

You could alternatively do:

* Liverpool to Belfast (keep this because flights are frequent, short, and cheap)
* Belfast to Dublin
* Dublin to Galway
* Galway to Dingle
* Dingle to Wexford/Rosslare
* Rosslare to Wales

Long term no one gives a shit about GCSE's. But short term, attaining decent marks is semi-accurate reflection of your work ethic and dedication, which is what people really care about and what's going to lead you to the most opportunities.

Got a month till your exams, do your best, ask for help (online) when you need it. If it turns out your best hasn't been good enough come results time, mainly because it came too late, own that.

If so, get whatever ~~shitty~~^(not a good attitude, excuse me) basic job you can and sign up to a college to redo your gcse's, with hard work, I guarantee, you'll be ready to retake them, will give a good account of yourself and then move forward from there as you see fit.

But, I doubt that is the case. And I know of no reliable investment for £2,000 that will earn you more than the bank is going to charge you in arrangement fees or interest.

Regarding putting his extra into pension, that's a hard one to say. On the one hand, if his work is matching or part matching his contributions, plus the tax kick back he gets, putting this money into a pension if he doesn't necessarily *need* it right now can be a very solid investment. You have already stated that he could pay off his OD on his old wage if he wanted, so it doesn't sound like he feels he needs the extra cash right now.

Also he can change his pension contributions whenever he feels like and so if he finds he needs the extra per month later, he can get it.

Overall I think you two need to sit down and talk about where you two are heading and want to go over say the next 5 years. You say you want to save for a property, while he seems to rather save for retirement. No one else but you two can say which of those is the right choice as neither are ""wasting"" your money.

There will be a good agent that will see thus through for you and keep you in the loop. Even if they're calling each day to say ""I've check and the order is still due to complete in x days"".

The most dangerous roads are narrow country lanes where the 60 mph limit is excessively high.

One factor with the 50 limit is that in many cases it is a result of the distance between junctions.

I think RTD was better at character development. Moffat has a knack for setting up a fascinating mystery and telling the story by jumping all over the place. The problem is he loses his protagonists in this process and so find ourselves watching his episodes from a bird's eye view, not really invested in what's happening.

The other problem with Moffat's mysteries is that they don't have satisfying endings. You're not left with that ""of course"" feeling you'd expect from a detective novel. The ""solution"" seems to be shoehorned in—not really fitting the original mystery and the logic to get there is usually pretty dodgy.

I think he can write good episodes if he's answering to a competent showrunner who will push him to write well. I get the sense that success has gone to his head. Nobody says no to him any more and he's just phoning it in.

The new sponsorship with Yokohama Rubber is worth about £20 million extra (£40m compared to £18m from the Samsung deal), along with the Torres money off our books (~£18m p/a), and the fact that Eden Hazard's signed a new contract means we have about £40 million in FFP cash to spend.

This is huge money. Pogba, assuming a 100 million Euro transfer fee (~£73 million) and a 200k a week deal, amortised over a 5 year deal, comes out to £25 million per year.

&gt;Steep penalties add muscle to the law. If a foreign bank – not just in Canada, but anywhere – fails to report even a single US citizen as a customer to the IRS, the US Treasury department would withhold 30% of the banks’ US income as penalty.

&gt;Foreign banks, some of whom earned a reputation as tax scofflaws, are now deeply afraid of the Internal Revenue Service.

&gt;The US government is policing foreign banks aggressively as it comes down hard on any company that helps tax evaders, money launderers and other criminals.

&gt;Scared of running afoul of US banking laws, foreign banks are taking extreme steps to limit US citizens to a narrow range of services.

Clara's character is not relateable and her motives are often unexplained. She's not a protagonist. In many ways she's the chief antagonist. We have to figure out why she's treating Danny and the Doctor the way she is—why she lies about travelling with the Doctor.

The Doctor isn't the protagonist either. He's just as cold and aloof. That's fine. The Doctor has often been a mystery in Doctor Who; that's why you have companions. Companions are the people the audience relates to, they're the people we'd like to be, travelling in the Tardis with the Doctor.

Series 8 has an enigma as a companion and an enigma as the central character. We're left with no one to empathise with, so the stories don't have an emotional impact.

Assuming he's a higher rate tax payer (and he's doing well if he is having only graduated three years ago) pensions are one of the best returning investments you can make.

Every student overdraft I've ever had has been interest free so there's literally been zero incentive to pay it off, you just treat the overdraft limit as the new ""floor"" balance and work from there.  There are risks here though, banks can cancel the overdraft, or suddenly start charging interest and at that point it's good to have cash to pay it off immediately which is something you can't do with a pension.

The one thing that strikes me here though is that you're both seemingly very young which means that money in a pension cannot be accessed at all for likely in excess of thirty years, future you will thank you for putting money away but that's a long time and there are several obvious cash-flow issues that you might come across before then, not least as you say buying a house but also just unexpected things that you can't directly plan for.

A good way forward here would be to ask what his investments outside of pensions are, you can currently invest around £15k/year into a ISA which is possibly better than making increased pension contributions assuming that he's not a higher rate tax payer and you might want to access the money at some point.  If your plans for a house are long-term then he could also invest from the same choice of funds in the ISA as he currently has with his pension.",null,0,null,1428484954,null,0,false,0,cq55tm3,null,t3_31uo8s,null,t1_cq55tm3,null,t3_31uo8s,null,null,null,1432264218,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

null,false,2econdclasscitizen,null,null,null,"I've understood from what you've said that there is a will, and that your husband's step-father is your husband's mother's 'then husband', which would make him the other executor, with your husband's uncle. If this isn't right, please let me know. 

I'm also assuming that the relationships here have broken down to the extent that talking with the uncle won't get the issues resolved. That said, it could still be worth a try. Formal action will cause more upset and costs money, so should be a last resort. 

The first issue thing to address is the amount of time that has passed since the incident. Recovery action would need to begin within six years of the date of the alleged wrong/loss (the date the box was emptied - assuming this happened all at once) OR, if later, within three years of the date the wronged person *should have* become aware that they had cause for concern. 

Whether the concern should have been known will depend on the facts of what happened - what property was in the box, who it was for, when it was to be distributed, the actions taken by those involved, etc. It might be that, as an executor, the step-father should have known about the issue earlier than he did for some reason, or perhaps circumstances are such that he would have had no cause to think anything was amiss until he and your husband went to the bank. I couldn't give a view without quite a bit more information and it might be that you'd like to avoid posting too much detail. Maybe PM me if you're concerned? 

Assuming the events didn't take place too long ago, there are two avenues of enquiry that could potentially be pursued here: the other executor and the bank. Here are some thoughts on each. 

THE OTHER EXECUTOR 

Executors are required to implement the wishes of the deceased testator, as described in the will, for the benefit of the beneficiaries. If they don't, the courts can force them to do so correctly, and if this is impossible (say because an asset belonging to the estate has been sold improperly and can't be recovered) they may be liable to pay compensation to the estate or a particular beneficiary who has lost out. So, if your husband's mother's will leaves your husband a particular heir loom, he has standing as a beneficiary to bring a claim against his uncle over the failure to implement the will correctly to his detriment. 

The step-father will also have standing as an executor to bring an action against the uncle. If other property meant for specific beneficiaries was in the box and has not been distributed in accordance with the will, it might make more sense for the step-father to try to get everything resolved at once.  

Having said this, it could be difficult to enforce any UK judgment obtained against the uncle in the US. If there are no assets in the UK, I don't know whether it's possible to sue in the county/state the uncle lives off the back of the UK liability. I doubt it, but maybe try asking about this in r/legaladvice . 

THE BANK 

Depending on what the will, probate, and the bank's own documentation said, there may be an argument that the bank should not have released the box to the uncle without the step-father's agreement. For example, something somewhere might specify that both executors need to sign to withdraw. However, normally I don't think there would be an issue with a bank releasing a safe deposit box or any other assets belonging to a deceased person to one of the executors without the consent of the others, so there would have to be something which specifically said otherwise in the documentation. 

The step-father could ask the bank to explain the steps it took to verify that the box could be released to a sole executor, documentation held in relation to the box, etc. If something doesn't feel right and the bank won't co-operate or refuses to accept it made a mistake when it looks like it may have, the Financial Ombudsman Service might be able to help.

Now I stay because I know Capaldi will be awesome if someone gets around to writing him a good episode.

3. Most importantly: there is so much potential in the Doctor Who story. The story of a man, living in exile from his home planet and travelling all of time of space in his huge but tiny blue box—it's so compelling. There so many good stories that could be written about this man and the people who travel with him.

I'm not saying they won't do business, I'm saying they won't spend as much time here.  The business elements are different to the personal wealth which is non-dom taxed.  Business earnings can simple be incorporated in a tax haven, it is only the personal wealth effected.

&gt; I'd be surprised if 1 in 8 left.

Technically they aren't here to begin with!

I worry that some people have this optimistic view of the world.  They think, fuck that guy earning money, after all, *I don't think anyone need more than £150k pa*, so they say, let's tax that person at 50%.  The issue is that person has freedom of movement.  So you can end up getting less back.  So then you have someone earning millions but paying only say £100k in a tax.  They are still a massive benefit to our society.  Sure you might argue, that they should be paying a few million instead.  But they are not getting £100k of value.

I know many people who've left the UK, some to Geneva, some to HK, some to Singapore etc.  It's not all about tax, it's about the quality of life they can have.  I do really understand, why would I rather live in the UK than in Singapore, even on the same income.  Then add in the fact I can have considerable more 'things', it becomes so attractive.

The way I see it, we demand so much from human beings that play a game, a beautiful game that elicits so much emotion.

But I never forget that professional sport is a cold business where any romantic notion of legacy and loyalty is upended by the blessing and curse of money.

So many supporters are so distrustful of ownership and, yet, when it comes to our beloved footballers we are so quick to point out the disloyalty of a player.

But does ownership ever show loyalty to a player? Do supporters ever show loyalty to a player?

* Oh, you're shit now.
* Oh, you're not good enough for the club.
* Ship him out.
* How dare he demand such wages.

We demand so much sacrifice and loyalty from these footballers to give everything to us and a club we hold so dear but we are quick to treat them as mere commodities, stocks that are bought and sold at a whim.

Many times a player is shipped off and we murmur, ""He wasn't good enough; Business reasons."" But if a player says, ""I'm off. Here's the transfer request. Business reasons."" Outrage.

I understand that there's a weird combination of naivety and cynicism and romanticism in all this ... but I guess I struggle to muster the outrage over the wage demands from a player or the hatred towards a player who hands in a transfer request or anger for the who implicitly goes for the money.

It's a long-winded way of saying, hey, for the most part, I harbor no ill-will towards Fernando Torres or Raheem Sterling or whoever.

The GIF was heartbreaking, the resulting picture was heartwarming and it was nice to see the human side of footballers.

And, moreover, a charity match like the one for Steven Gerrard really shows how respected Gerrard is and the reverence that a lot of former players still have for Liverpool, sometimes remaining and raising families in the city.

I'm not saying we can't sustain a larger population physically - but I'm asking whether we want to?

What will our quality of life be like? In my lifetime alone (24 years) the population of the UK has increased by 6.68 million people or 11.63%. Keep in mind over the entirety of my grandfather's life (90 years) the population increased by 21.33 million.

As the ONS said:
&gt;[Since 1964 the population of the UK has grown by over 10 million people (18.7%).  About half of this growth has occurred since 2001.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/2013/sty-population-changes.html)

This is clearly not sustainable with our current way of life.

The problem is that the effects of overpopulation come slowly - I mean people of my generation would struggle to imagine the vastly less populated Britain of 1964. The larger houses and gardens, empty motorways and less crowded cities and railways.

So really we have to ask ourselves although it may be physically possible - do we want Britain to be like Bangladesh?

Our [FAQ section on investment choices](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment) specifies expensive short-term debts above all other choices, because the return required from investments is unrealistic when set against the costs of maintaining debt balances like a 17% APR overdraft.

I used to work as a mortgage underwriter and we would typically expect to see a large overdraft repaid before lending was given, so your summation of the first £x being written off by the overdraft is fairly close to the truth.

There is some nepotism, some roles created for children of important contributors etc.  These two moments for me stick out.

The first was a fair few years back, I wasn't long out of uni, and I was still very naive about the real world, it's a fancy party in some shit awful place off the kings road, I'd been working for a few weeks at this hedge fund and this was a kind of charity fund raiser thing, one of those have your employees encouraged to use GAYE for your political advantage type affairs.  Anyway, I see someone who is looking very nonplussed by this whole swing-ding and go over to chat to her, she was bored and hammered, a state I frequently find myself in, we're talking and stuff, she asks who I'm donating to, how much etc.  It turns out she was on the board of one of the charities.  She was 23, never had a job, no understanding of business, managing people, economics even basic accounting.  Been paid 6 figures and having a flat in Chelsea, all paid for, by this charity her parents set up.  Shocking nepotism.  What's worse in a way is I think she was miserable in her life!

It turned out she'd finished her MBA interned at a major US bank in the structured products team, finished her MSc in some form of statistics and was being parachuted into her parents charity in south america, built mostly with mining money.

I agree. I think the chemical is addictive, but because of the way it's actually used, and it's role within society, it doesn't lend itself as well to problematic addiction - as you said.

I think MDMA is definitely one of the safer drugs out there, and I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of users never experienced anything which others would consider problematic addiction.

No Coutinho for me as we need the hard work of Allen, despite his critics. Lucas, gives the defensive base.  Allen and Henderson tge legs. Sterling on the tip of the diamond for the pace.  Sturridge and Ballotelli up top as they cant play up top by themselves. Kolo keeps his place as we need experience back there despite his mistakes on Saturday.

There are three main reasons, the first being that alcohol has been around for ages and will never go away, the second that it can be consumed in amounts that have virtually no effect and so is enjoyed for purposes other than getting drunk, the final one is that it's irrelevant. Who cares that alcohol is damaging, why do we need to add something else that is damaging (and not *substantially* less harmful) just because it is less damaging than alcohol?

But, of course, it's all ""CRISIS: LIVERPOOL PLAYERS REFUSING CONTRACTS; FSG, RODGERS LOSING TEAM.""

However, if one takes a step back, I think it's a reflection on the difficult position that Liverpool FC are in at the moment especially with the way this current season has gone ...

* Pay the player what he wants; The club loses leverage not only for that particular player but for future players. We saw something like that with transfer fees where many clubs felt, ""We'll just hold out long enough and those silly and desperate American owners will pay the fee that we want.""
* But at the same time, the club does not have enough leverage to say, ""Take it or leave it.""

I think some players and agents perceive Liverpool as cornered or desperate and feel as if that now is the opportunity to threaten Liverpool with un-signed contracts and transfer requests.

LFC as a club and players/agents are locked in a staring contest and we're waiting to see who blinks first.

I think that Brendan Rodgers has a massive role to play in all this because it will be up to him to act as a sort of middle-man and convince players to trust him, his tactics, his vision and trust the ownership to do the right thing when that vision is achieved.

It'd be nice to think of our position as much more concrete after all, ""Hey, we're Liverpool FC!"" but it's clear that we are not at the moment and the decisions we make now will set the tone and precedent for the future.

All that said, I, for one, think that an appropriate compromise will be reached for all of our players who are allegedly ""rejecting"" contracts left and right.",null,0,null,1428487086,null,0,false,0,cq569vu,null,t3_31usi4,null,t1_cq569vu,null,t1_cq55ydm,null,null,null,1432264431,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

**Training** from such a strip generally isn't allowed. Training historically had to be from an airfield which is licensed by the authorities - but a fairly recent change (a few years ago) in the law allows training from unlicensed strips. However, the training organisation must be able to provide evidence that the unlicensed strip is at least as safe to operate from as a licensed airfield. Since your land probably doesn't have its own fire service, etc, it's unlikely to meet those requirements.

**Low flying rules**: there is an exemption from most of the low-flying rules when taking off or landing; however, the one rule from which you are not exempt is the requirement to not be below 1000' over a built up area. So if your strip is in a built up area, or the only way to approach/depart your strip is in a built up area, then that's a no-go.

**Planning laws** also play an important part. In the UK, it's legal to use any land for any purpose for up to 28 days per year. The main reason for this is so that you can hold what Americans would call a yard-sale on your land without needing planning permission. But a side-effect of this law is that you can use your land as an airfield for up to 28 days per year.

I agree that not all productivity increases will be good, factory farming is an example, but that is why regulations are necessary. Companies do not care about social welfare or the environment as profits are the main driver of all actions. 

I would not put the blame of stressful jobs on productivity gains as working longer hours or in a more stressful environment does not increase productivity in a the long run, a classic example would be the Japanese labour market. A Japanese salaryman will work close to 60 hours a week, they also report larger levels of stress in the work place than office workers in other developed countries. Productivity per worker is actually comparable to the G7 average despite such long hours and busy jobs, and productivity per hour worked is much lower. 

I do agree that productivity gains may increase unemployment in the future but it hasn't been seen yet. Increases in productivity require more highly skilled workers, this is fine if displaced workers are able to re-skill and re-enter the job market, something we have seen in the past and still see. Unfortunately for workers, automation in more highly skilled jobs is likely in the near future. This means that low skilled workers will have to make a far bigger leap in their skill levels to find a job, something which is likely to be unrealistic for many people.

In all honesty, I think he's run his course. I consider myself a rational thinking, considered supporter. I'm not prone to simply blaming one person for bad results, it's not Nolan's fault, it isn't even really Sam's fault. He started the season well, confidence was high and other teams were not expecting such a positive team to play against.

 However let's not forget the abject performance against Southampton which completely tore us apart. What we have is a good team with no squad depth, so when injuries arrive, we struggle to cover the positions. Also, when teams discover that playing a narrow diamond means you're susceptible to attacks down the wings, we have difficulty adapting our formation to cope.

I think Sam will go, it's clear the owners are fed up of him, Sullivan likes nothing more than undermining him via the press. Whichever manager they replace him with will need to set out early that he is in charge, not them. No board signings of out of shape players who aren't capable of performing at this level (Zarate)

You can see where one would get downvoted and the other would not even though one may disagree with the well-crafted explanation.

Furthermore, I think there is a curious arrogance that some Redditors show when their opinion is downvoted, as if what they wrote was so important and thought-provoking and the rest just don't understand.

In addition, there is a sort of childishness that comes with someone who desires mindless support from those who wear the same colors under the banner of ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" As if disagreements should come with a disclaimer that states, ""Hey fellow Liverpool supporter. Very nice post! Thank you for your support. Unfortunately, I disagree with you. Allow me to take the time to clearly illustrate why without hurting your feelings.""

Finally, there is a romantic stubbornness, naivety and condescension that comes with those who cluck their tongues, hands on hips and say, ""Don't you know Reddiquette? Don't you know what is proper?""

Have you considered ...

* That your post was poorly written?
* That perhaps your argument did not demonstrate your knowledge of the situation?
* Or perhaps your argument demonstrated your *lack* of knowledge?
* That there are unintelligent assholes on Reddit who lack the time, patience or desire to engage in a proper debate on the Internet with a stranger?
* That in spite of it all and whether it's fair or not, that upvotes/downvotes are overwhelming used as Agree/Disagree buttons?

There are people out there who always seem to cry out about how they were treated unjustly and how their voice was silenced by the masses. And while those people grumble, they often lack the self-awareness to consider, ""Hey, maybe *I* did something wrong. Maybe *I* didn't present my argument effectively. Maybe *I* am actually wrong.""

There were two world wars in that period - the adjusted figure would most likely be much higher. 

&gt; I mean people of my generation would struggle to imagine the vastly less populated Britain of 1964. The larger houses and gardens, empty motorways and less crowded cities and railways.

Since the early 1900 that 80% of the population can be considered to live in an urban environment. And anybody that looked at circa mid-1950/60s period working class houses can call them anything but large even by today's standards - I spent quite some time house hunting in London 3 years ago, viewed quite a lot of ex-council flats, and I can tell you that they were actually quite a lot smaller than the flat that I live in now (at a comparable price if you factor in square footage).

&gt; So really we have to ask ourselves although it may be physically possible - do we want Britain to be like Bangladesh?

Britain neither currently looks anything like Bangladesh, nor is it in any danger of ever looking like it - [evidence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096). Quote:

I then tried to exit the situation by suggesting that it isn't something to argue over, to which you responded: 

&gt;Your position appears to be that if you don't like it then it shouldn't be discussed, let alone countered with legitimate points of your own.

I tried to clarify that I wasn't interested in this argument and yet you persist.

But here's the thing. Eriksen is not a winger. He can play off the wing, but he is not a winger. Sure, you can make the case that he gets more time on the ball when he's on the left, but he's fundamentally not a winger. Wide playmaker? Maybe, but his tendency to still play in the middle speaks against that, and by sticking him out wide (and subsequently having him wander into the middle) deprives us of a wide player, which definitely does not help our lack of width.

I would still like to see him either in a roaming role where he *could* move out on the wing (which arguably is the case with our entire front three right now), or a smidgen further back, almost like the front player in a midfield 3, just ahead of Bentaleb and Mason. This would also give him room to move *without* depriving us of a proper presence on the left wing (ideally someone like Memphis Depay or Konoplyanka) and giving our wingers more room to cut in, albeit at the cost of his own mobility.

Playing Eriksen on the wing and slotting Dembele in the middle instead doesn't, as far as I'm concerned, really solve our problem. We would still end up playing entirely through the middle, and we don't have the kind of creativity to unlock that kind of defence, as we saw against Burnley, and as we've seen countless times this season. And with Eriksen drifting we still end up with a much improved but still not exceptional Danny Rose having to cover the entire wing by himself. 

A good case for Eriksen moving a bit deeper is made [here](http://www.spursstatman.com/blog/2014/11/25/hull-city-a-241114-post-match-tactical-analysis), for further reading.

People have a motivation, they have some need.  I'm currently financially supporting one of my family members financially.  I don't get out of bed in the morning thinking *hmm, I'd better do that for xxxx* I am working a 75 hour week because I think of a Pipistrel Panthera or something.  You could argue that's greed, but I'm a dyslexic who was expelled from school, I wasn't borne into some nice situation, I've pushed myself and worked hard to improve my quality of life.  I'm happy to pay a suitable amount of tax, around 30% overall income I think is fair.  But more than that, and I'll probably jump ship, the quality of my life matters, otherwise, I won't get out of bed, I'll just succumb to depression.",null,0,null,1428492072,null,0,false,0,cq57glf,null,t3_31sp3b,null,t1_cq57glf,null,t1_cq571qn,null,null,null,1432264990,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;[...]

&gt;Someone who is a non-dom and lives in the UK for less than seven years can currently use the special non-dom rules free of any charge. They then have to pay charges ranging from £30,000 a year for people who have been UK resident for seven out of the past nine years, to £90,000 a year for those who have been UK resident for 17 of the past 20 years.

So it's more of a symbolic move and won't raise that much money (hundreds of millions of pounds; pocket change for the Government). The Conservatives recently increased the annual charge non-doms pay.

What's more important, to both individuals and the economy as a whole, is the health of the housing market.  London is very crowded, but what percentage of them could actually buy a property within an hour of central London?  A tiny, tiny amount.

null,false,CherryInHove,null,null,null,"I live in North Hove (Hangleton), and commute to London. My reason for living here rather than Brighton is due to family and the fact that I could get a proper house for the price of a one bed flat in Brighton.

With regards to commuting, the problem with going from Hove is that the train you get from there comes from Littlehampton and so the commuting train is pretty full by the time it gets into Hove. You can usually get a seat (not always), but if you wanted to work on the train, there is no chance of you getting a table. If you go from Brighton, then you're getting on at the first stop, so you can easily get a table. Preston Park is generally OK for getting a table as well (so quite often I'll walk from my house to Preston Park station).

Admittedly my place is a bit of a distance from the sea. I mean, I can see it from the window, but it's certainly not walking distance with children, but it is only about 10 minutes on the bus to get to the sea front so it's not too bad.

I'm quite fortunate in that my office is in Victoria, so I don't need to get on a tube or bus after, but if you are definitely going to have to do that, then I think you'll definitely want to be going from Brighton/Preston Park as the idea of possibly having to stand up the entire journey from Hove to Victoria and then get on a tube would fill me with absolute dread.",null,0,null,1428492506,null,0,false,0,cq57l25,null,t3_31uvax,null,t1_cq57l25,null,t3_31uvax,null,null,null,1432265048,null,1,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,1,null

The biggest frustration was that we were so close. Medical and all. That's why it was so crushing at the time. But then we, fans, thought - hey, maybe it was because we had someone better lined up? And then it quickly became clear we didn't have much options and when Balotelli link came along... well, signing him was more of a relief than joy. We at least got someone.

Where were they living?

All the people who whine about the IRS selectively omit that you aren't liable for any income taxes under $95,000 (more than £60,000), and that you get a credit for every dollar of tax you've paid abroad. Double taxation is very rare in Western Europe, and can easily be mitigated by good estate planning. There's also a few tax differences (like the BoJo case: CGT isn't paid on a first house sale in the UK, but is in the US. He paid his bill eventually) but they're minor. 

There's also the very real fact that the IRS is not particularly interested in middle-class US citizens who live in Western Europe and don't have a great deal of assets other than a house or a pension. They are interested in the people who squirrel away millions in Swiss bank accounts, or the people who think by living in Singapore they don't have to pay any US taxes. 

Hell, I don't think my aunt has ever filed a US tax return since moving abroad and she's 75 and lived in the Netherlands for almost 40 years. She has never had a negative consequence from it, and even owns a house in America. I wouldn't advise that but it relates to my point. 
 
You have to file an income tax return every year. It takes about 15 minutes and then you're done until next April. It's really not a big deal.

The issues I have with the fees are:


1. That Lib Dem candidates all signed a personal pledge to **vote against any rise in fees** - this isn't simply a case of them not having enough power to do what they want in government, it's going back on what was a very clear promise of personal voting intention.

2. The structure of the repayment system. The people who will end up paying the most are those who earn middle incomes over long periods, the very wealthy who pay off quickly or up-front (through rich parents) end up paying **less** than those who go on to earn middle incomes. This is in no way a fair or 'graduate tax' system. I would be wholeheartedly behind a graduate tax.

3. (Optional one) - Ideology. There are those who believe the fairest way of paying for University tuition is to burden the cost on the individual (who they see as the benefiting the most) and those who believe that Society as whole should burden at least some if not all of the cost. I'm not 100% on one side of this one but definitely do believe it's wrong to treat University education as simply a means of personal financial benefit.",null,0,null,1428493161,null,0,false,0,cq57s38,null,t3_31s9be,null,t1_cq57s38,null,t1_cq4of35,null,null,null,1432265140,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Jangles,CupFinalsCrest,,null,"&gt; Granted Bolasie isn't world class but defenders still hate one on ones no matter who it is and Bolasie isn't piss poor either. Last season we played quality counter attacking football and that starts with a solid defense. When players don't track back (Nasri is a prime example) this system falls down

To play counter attacking football relies on quick breaks and quality attackers who are unpredictable. Being able to counter relies on players being able to break quickly and not be then counter countered by the break collapsing leaving gaps. The alternative is leaving a small amount of your squad in attack, often attacking midfielders or strikers. 

&gt; When do you ever see world class teams leaving huge gulfs between the midfield and defence like we have done this season? When do they leave their defence so exposed? Bayern did this against us when we beat them 3-2 and twice we capitalised on their mistakes and exposed the risks they were taking.

Madrid and Bayern do it. You'll notice we scraped a 3-2 against Bayern relying on individual unforced errors. A wins and win but don't hold it up as genius. They hammered us immediately. They do it because A) In the Madrid system it pegs the opposition fullbacks into never attacking. You don't leave Gareth Bale or CR with just space to attack into. B) The Bayern wingers are less threatening but they can stay up because, as should happen in our system, the midfield moves across and covers the fullback. This permits the winger to stay up. It doesn't work in our system because Toure can't be arsed. No amount of Navas tracking back will fix a failure for the mid to correctly move across as the position a tracking winger ends up in is different.

&gt; This is why we are losing games like Crystal Palace because players don't work towards the defensive transition and suddenly you have 3 attackers rushing our back line. Every game this season I've cringed when we lost the ball because you know we are going to get countered and our defence and scrambling to win the ball back.


We were 2-0 down with Jesus Navas on and his defensive contribution is the crux of your argument. We look poor because our back line is in poor form and our central midfield do shit all. Dinho at least tackles but gives away fouls, Toure does nothing and Fernando is the worst player I've seen get in the City kit since the takeover. The attacking mids shouldn't need to track back every goddamn time if they do their job.",null,0,null,1428493226,null,0,false,0,cq57ssa,null,t3_31svrt,null,t1_cq57ssa,null,t1_cq579mu,null,null,null,1432265149,null,-1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,-1,null

Never, let your cigars get much above 72rh. You are essentially asking for mold to start with that kind of humidity. Try to ensure your cigars keep above 60 at all times. This is more of a safety net to be honest, they will survive going below that for a shirt period of time but it's best not to chance it. If your cigars are kept in a low rh environment for too long they will start to dry out, all the great oils that make up a cigar will disappear as well. 

I want the freedom to choose a cigar and smoke it right away, so I keep my cooler and my wineador at an average of 63rh. I honestly think that the flavours are better at around this humidity, my chances of mold are low, and I don't have to drybox for 24 hours before I smoke.  It also reduces the chance I'm going to have draw or burn problems too.

Ageing is an often misused term. Some people think that a cigar that is a month old is aged, some a year, some ten years. My take is that anything under a year is just rest. Anything over is age. So for storage of cigars that you don't intend to smoke do a search on /r/cigars for a guy called /u/beardofcastro. You will find a post of his all about his method of aging cigars, and it's worth reading because Frank has a huge collection of vintage cigars (think well over 10 years old, many of them older than 30).

They say this very explicitly in Deep Breath. He was also suffering from PTSD from being stuck on Trenzalore for 900 years in a war. Danny was set up as a parallel to the Doctor, both had just come out of war, both wanted Clara's affection, both had lonely childhoods in places with many other children, both had childhoods influenced by time travel, they shared a childhood toy but Danny was wise ""because he had a really bad day"" while the Doctor was unwise due to rewriting his defining bad day in the 50th. All of this combined during season 8 to give us the culmination of the Time Lord Victorious and give us a retelling of the 1st Doctor's character arc with this first incarnation of the new cycle. Through season 8 12 was constantly struggling to break down the veils he had set up and try to understand how he could be ""good"" and heroic while manipulating and lying people. This was the same issue he struggled with in the God Complex on a larger scale. Meanwhile, Clara went from extremely grounded and having fun with 11 where she was very taken in by the happy side 11 liked to present to the world to struggling to understand 12 right along with him. In Deep Breath she was forced into a battle of wits with a terrifying threat, and in the firs half of the season she was trying to provide a moral basis to this new slightly lost Doctor. This all came to a head in Kill the Moon where he forced her into his usual position against her will. Being forced to make a ""bad choice"" like he usually has to forced her to see things more from his perspective and this was cemented by his explanation of his choices in Mummy on the Orient Express, in Flatline we saw her take her new understanding of the Doctor and apply it but we also saw that she was applying the traits he sees and negative in himself by lying to Danny and quickly accepting the deaths of others, at the end he is troubled by this as she is no longer fulfilling the role of his moral compass just as he is starting to make sense of himself (""the man that stops the monsters). Finally in the finale, Clara's Doctor-ness comes up against his own and we see her attempt to manipulate him but him easily come out on top, she ends up using this again in bluffing with the Cybermen and in the climax the Doctor is forced into a position of making ""bad choices"" by Missy which forces him to finally realize who he really is (an adventurer with a good heart and nothing more or less). This time the Doctor doesn't have to make the choices because he is able to give power to others to control their own destiny and is no longer burdened by his own morality. Finally, Clara lost her final tie to Earth and in the cafe they lie to each other in an attempt to let each other be happy.

Look at all the transfers. Sold - these won't count the lower fee players like Luongo and Obika, add a couple million more on in total probably:

13/14

Huddlestone - £5m for a player who hardly played.

Caulker- £9m. Insane price tag.

Dempsey - £6m

Defoe - £6m - 30 year old striker who scored once in the league in 2013? Nuts money.

Parker - £3.5m - for a 32 year old going off the boil? That's crazy money.

Bale - £86m, world record money for a player who's not the best in the world. Like it or not, that's a good deal.

14/15:

Naughton - £5m for a backup RB. Not a bad player but that's a lot for a third choice backup who was behind a converted CB (Dier and Vlad) in the pecking order.

Sandro - £10m for an injury prone guy (injured in training for a couple of months at the start of the year celebrating a goal). Crazy money.

Fryers - £3m for a 5th choice?

Daws - £6m, great deal

Falque - £4m for a guy that played maybe once or twice for the club in a couple of years? Insane.

Livermore - £8m for a backup who hardly played?

Coulibaly - £1.5m. Who I hear you ask.

Are you seriously telling me that's not impressive? That's 11 players gone who mostly didn't play/weren't going to play anymore and Bale for **£67m/£153m**. Like it or not, if you can't see that that's an extraordinary transfer deal then I don't know what to say.

Now the buys (fee - performance and value up until now):

Chadli - £7m. Meh first season, good this season overall. Yes he's dipped but his father died, that's understandable.

Paul - £17m, not a good deal.

Soldado - [£13m + £13m performance addons aka £13m paid so far](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/tottenham-transfer-news-spurs-set-to-sell-roberto-soldado-to-atletico-madrid-to-fund-deals-for-loic-remy-and-jay-rodriguez-9453440.html) - not a good deal

Lamela - ~£26/30m depending on reports, not good.

Eriksen - £11.5m, great deal

Vlad - £8.5m, meh

Capoue - £9m, meh

14/15

Davies - Exchange with Sig - sured up the left essentially, competition for Rose, good deal imo

Vorm - £3.5m, good deal. Great price for a good backup.

Dier - £4m, great deal for a guy who can play in 2 positions and is only 21, looks to be a very good talent

Fazio - £7.5m, pretty good deal. Nowhere near as good as Dier, but pretty good.

Stam - £4.5m, reasonable.

Alli - £5m, we have no idea at this moment in time, potentially good/great (highly rated 18 y/o playing very well in league 1)

Yedlin - £2.5m, no idea, but potentially good with almost guaranteed profit on sale

Buys:

I count 6 good, 3 meh/reasonable, 3 bad, 2 unknowns. Now look at other clubs and on average, what are their hit rates? 

Transfer spending:

Good - £33.5m

Meh -  £22m

Bad - £56m

Unknown - £7.5m

Total: £119m

**Net spend: -£35m (ish).**

The ability to sell players *far* outweighs the less than suitable brought in and even then you're discounting the good buys that have been made, of which there have been quite a few. There will always be bad buys, try to find a club that hasn't done so. Chelsea - £50m for Torres. Man U - Falcao's for £6m and £300k/week (about £20m for a season), Anderson and Zaha were about £26m and £12m, they did nothing. Liverpool - Carroll for £35m, Keane £12m etc.

Just for the record, it is absolutely ridiculous that you think them voting against the fees is 'undemocratic' considering the reason we actually require a majority vote rather than just a majority government saying ""this is what we're doing, tough shit"" is because we are a democracy. That's how democracy works - more than 50% of MP's have to agree or it doesn't pass. If the PM introduces a policy and 60% of government don't agree, then it doesn't pass regardless of whether it came from the top or not. You will nearly always find that some MP or another has voted against a policy, even if it was introduced by their party.
