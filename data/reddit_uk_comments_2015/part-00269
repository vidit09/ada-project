In response to a few points:

* without trying very hard it is possible to get a cash ISA with roughly 2% interest [moneysupermarket] whilst official inflation has been 0% for a little while [google]. A quick look at some popular stocks and shares ISAs shows that a *low risk*profile could reliably generate growth of around 3%. So I was perhaps a little optimistic with 4%. This seems to fit with the paper you linked. Perhaps 2% withdrawal is acceptable for back of the envelope calculations, I expect this would preserve the capital in line with inflation.

* a suitable question in relation to my original topic might be what level of risk is assumed when investing in a single property? A single property is probably quite volatile too, probably more volatile than a well balanced portfolio investment. You could even invest in property and spread the risk over many properties and markets.

* there are also unexpected shortfalls with home ownership, for instance the fridge breaks and needs replacing.

* I'm not totally sure on the cost of selling/buying a house but I gather they are far more as a one off than renting. For instance estate agency fees and surveyor fees. I have rented several houses and the total fee to move has always been under £300 *presuming* you get the deposit back at the end, and not including stuff like removal vans which are required in either case.

I can't say you've highlighted anything to make it more complicated, only more expensive than originally sketched. One thing I still need to research more onto is: if I won £150,000 and was renting is it better to buy a house or invest for passive tax free income. This would probably give the answer to the question of 'invest to rent'.

I would play Rodrigo as a striker) but for the Position we need we were too slow once again. I'm quite happy with the signings we made but the priority was always to get a good striker. 
Now i would go for:

1. lacazette (he is a proven goalscorer in a league which became very tough over the last years. He is small but so is agüero and so i tevez. Two very good strikers we have/had in the premier league)

2. aubameyang (he would fit perfectly but he haven't scored that much goals that we can say he is a proven goalscorer)

3. jovetic if he would be injury free and he wouldn' be THAT expensive i think

4. benteke but not for that price. I wouldnt go higher than 28mill £

5. lukaku (yes i would go for lukaku as a last solution even if he is at Everton but this guy is a big talanted guy who has every atributes which benteke has)

If we can't get any of them i would rotate balo, ings and origi (and if available studge of course).

Yes! I would give balo another Chance! He deserves it but i think that Rodgers doesnt like him personally which is a big Problem and really unfair. He proved at City that he can play in bpl (13 goals with 20 years of age).

And i really like ings. If we play him more often i think he can become at least a 15 goals a season striker. This guy has a good touch and knows EXACTLY where the goal is!

The major parties in England have different spending priorities than in Scotland, that's the only reason you're paying for tuition and prescriptions.  You solve that problem by not giving them your vote and demanding an alternative.

If you want to change how the devolved governments are funded then there was FFA but look at how opposed Westminster is to that.  I'd love nothing more than for Scotland to be raising and spending all of its own taxes (short of being independent) but that's not allowed.

As for the thanks, I've never voted Labour in my life and never will.  My party have nothing to do with English tuition fees but I do agree that what Labour did was a perfect example of the imbalances and inadequacy of this union and the parties that support it.

This isn't a problem with the EU though, it's a problem with the current voting system of the UK. There's no fixed members of the EU council. Depending on what's being discussed, the relevant minister frome ach country is sent along. So for example, if a new health policy is being discussed, then our Secretary of State for Health attends the meetings.

The reason you don't get a say on exactly who is on the EU council is because you don't get a say on who has what position in our government. You do however get a say on what political party they belong to, so long as you vote in the UK general elections.

&gt; or eu commission

The president and members of the EU Commission are decided by the EU council. There is one president and 27 members of the EU commission, one member per EU state including the president. After being decided by the council, it is then voted on by the European Parliament, which consists of MEPs (the people you can actually vote for).

The issues you've mentioned about the EU also apply to our own government. We don't get a say on who is the leader of a party (the party members do), or of who has what position in the government (the party leaders do). All we get is a vote on the person who represents our constituency in our parliament.

If you want more say on who represents us in the EU council, then first we need to do something about our own government. If we could vote on who does what in our own government, then we can decide on who represents us in the EU council.

As simple as that may seem in your head it's not going to work.

Scotland is just the loudest voice of dissent currently because it's in the hands of a party who are interested in proper reform.

&gt; Man U and Robben are completely irrelevant as they're a different team and player. Although for what it's worth, Transfermarkt has Robben's value right now €13m more than Pedro, so it's no wonder teams are still interested in him.

Yeah his value right now is more than Pedro because he had time to settle down and play his game at his pace and remake a name for himsef. Do you know how much Real Madrid sold him for? £17m. That's £5m less than what we'll be getting Pedro for and £10m less than what they bought him off us for.

I personally don't think you have absolutely any idea about Pedro or Robben, especially if your source for judging them is Transfermarkt. Pedro is probably the most underrated player in Europe.

[The final Manchester derby at Maine Road, 2002.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqRRJxZHW8A) At the time, Manchester United were one of, if not *the*, best team in the world, and we upset them in an incredible fashion.

[The Ballet on Ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiYQUXe0VLk) was a legendary match that's taken a life of its own. Played between against Tottenham Hotspur in 1967 in snowy and icy conditions, the 4-1 win made them believe they could win the league that year... and they did.

[The 1956 FA Cup Final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-isJTLLWR08) for goalkeeper Bert Trautmann's bravery alone. He played the last 17 minutes of the match with a broken neck. And we still won.

[The 1969 FA Cup Final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqET6rfCaqQ) against Leicester City. On that team were some of Manchester City's greatest most beloved players, including Colin Bell, Mike Summerbee, Neil Young, and Francis Lee. We wouldn't win the FA Cup again until 2011.

[The 1976 League Cup Final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9gXWkeOb8g) where City beat Newcastle 2-1. It features an absolutely stunning winning goal by Dennis Tueart, and was our last domestic cup championship for another 35 years.

Perhaps the most important game Manchester City ever played was [the 1999 Football League Second Division Playoff Final.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBjxKS0N91o) The 90s weren't very good to us, and we were relegated to the third tier of English football. At the end of the 1998-99 season, Man City and Gillingham played a winner-take-all match to determine who would be the third and final team to be promoted to the second tier. Gillingham scored two goals in the 81st and 87th minute to give them a 2-0. Kevin Horlock scored in the 90th minute, which was all but considered a consolation prize... until Paul Dickov tied the match five minutes into extra time. The match went to penalties, which we won 3-1. Paul Dickov's heroics and City's come-from-behind win because of it instantly became legendary, and was the catalyst to get us back into true competitive football. (We were promoted yet again the following year, bringing us from the third tier of football to the Premier League in a span of just three seasons.)

(On a related note: notice how many City fans travelled from Manchester to London to see the match in person. The official attendance for that match—a third-level match, mind you—was 76,935. God, I love our fans.)

And then, my favorite moment as a City fan: [winning the Premier League championship in 2012.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81bv_gF4j5k) It actually mirrors the Gillingham match in 1999 as we came from behind in extra time. Edin Dzeko tied the match with a header off of a corner from David Silva, and then Sergio Aguero scored with 15 seconds left in extra time to win the league—our first championship since 1968. (Meanwhile, at Old Trafford, Manchester United were already celebrating as they thought they had won the League. Imagine their elation turn to heartbreak, and revel from it. They had looked down on us for decades, and now we can compete against them... and win.)

My second favorite moment? [The 6-1 annihilation against United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8xD9FrpjPU)... at United's home stadium, Old Trafford. I can watch this every day for the rest of my life, and it will always pick me up. [(TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdL6vvByiYU)

We are overly dependent on the state sector, yet Westminster won't dare allow development in high value industries such as finance and IT outside London.

Furthermore we're a progressive traditionally left leaning country than England - and the current politicians don't represent that. They don't even represent the views the majority of English people hold. 

It's Westminster (the institutional establishment) itself that we dislike.

You're only looking at league goals, and he played more league games in 13-14 than 09-10 and 10-11. Looking at all competitions, he scored more goals in both 09-10 and 10-11, was scoring more frequently with a better minutes/goal ratio.

&gt; 15 starts

15 starts, but still 35 appearances, 7 of those he was subbed on before halftime.

You can say what you want about me, but we're just arguing opinions here. I think his 09-11 seasons were his best, you think 13-14 and/or a future season is his best. They're close and were all very good, but you're acting like I'm saying he's been awful at every point in his career outside of 09-11. I'm not.

He only played 3 extra games in 2013, not to mention 4 of his goals in 09/10 were after coming off the bench. You've also conveniently ignored the fact that he had 5 less assists in 09/10.

&gt; 15 starts, but still 35 appearances, 7 of those he was subbed on before halftime.

Errr, not sure what stats you're looking at, but he only got subbed off at HT in one match this season.

&gt;You can say what you want about me, but we're just arguing opinions here. I think his 09-11 seasons were his best, you think 13-14 and/or a future season is his best.

You literally said he's was past his best. I don't know what else that is supposed to imply other than he's not good enough anymore. And that his best season was not in 09-11, which would be inaccurate given the statistics I've presented.

&gt; I also have no idea where you got that from.

That may have been due to overworking, the World Cup, pressure, or whatever, but the kid absolutely wasn't close to what he was in 13-14. The way he played for us, I think it's clear that he can benefit from a squad of top talent, if his unique talents are still important there. For us, we had two strikers who, while both the best in the league, weren't speed merchants. His speed was a unique asset to our club. At City, I'm not sure they'll necessarily benefit as much from his speed. He is essentially Navas, but slower and less capable of crossing. 

The thing about a kid being bought for this much is that, even if he doesn't push on to greatness, it's highly unlikely he'll ever be considered a terrible signing unless the media decides to make it their mission in life to ruin him. Honestly, that's very possible. I have no doubt that, despite Torres losing a step, the media hounded the guy and fucked his head right up. His Chelsea move was doomed before the ink dried. For Raheem it may very well be the same, especially because he's considered the nation's most exciting talent.

Greece is just the beginning, don't risk it!  Protect our right to govern and our right to sovereign and remember, the ""Labour"" movement came about to protect the rights of the workers, if you stay in the EU, you can throw a lot of those bits of protection away.  

Don't even go there with a ""United States of Europe"" because you can kiss parliament goodbye.  What in God's name is the point of the House of Commons if you have a United States with an electoral college ruling the roost?  Absolutely against it.

And you can blame UKIP and ourselves, UKIP for making it such a single issue regarding immigration and us for doing absolutely fuck all.

Corbyn's my first choice, none of them can win a GE so why not go with Corbyn, he's more likely to steer on on the right course. 2nd choice is trying to find the difference between the 2 ""Labour - I suppose"" candidates and someone who should be in the lib dems.

Labour is having a crisis because all these middle-aged career politicans seem to know nothing about playing politics to win elections like the Tories and nothing about real issues facing people today, that's a losing combination. 

Labour talk about reinvigorating the youth vote, but I can tell you every young person sees Labour as the party that introduced tuition fees that their parents vote for.

Reports had said the OO guys car was surrounded and he reversed in a panic

Someone else here has said he was driving up and down goading nationalist protesters before that.

Someone else had said their uncles car was attacked by a mob that attempted to pull him and his wife out of the car.

The BBC had stated the guy was arrested for his own safety at first, that has now changed to an attempted murder charge, so I don't know wtf to believe.

All large German companies must give a board positions to  representative from the workforce (usually a union member).

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codetermination_in_Germany)

&gt;Codetermination in Germany is a concept with a solid history that involves the right of workers to participate in management of the companies they work for.[1] Known as Mitbestimmung, the modern law on codetermination is found principally in the Mitbestimmungsgesetz of 1976. The law allows workers to elect representatives (usually trade union representatives) for almost half of the supervisory board of directors. The legislation is separate from the main German company law Act for public companies, the Aktiengesetz. It applies to public and private companies, so long as there are over 2000 employees. For companies with 500-2000 employees, one third of the supervisory board must be elected.

Let's be honest, Liverpool were never going to pay him 160-180,000 pounds a week. Hell, not even Gerrard was on that. If City came after him and told him he would start earning that, then I think that Sterling was in the right to force a move, and when Liverpool weren't budging, I can't really blame him for trying that hard.

Think about it. He is earning almost twice a week what he would have been earning at Liverpool if he accepted the new contract. That's a huge amount when the figure is 80k more a week. It sucks that Man City are able to afford that and we can't, but that is the reality we live in.

On the same train except in the opposite direction, a single mother was sitting in the carriage doorway with a child and a dog and she was on the phone with someone else.

The person she was talking to seemed to ask her where she was, at what station. 

She was unable work out what train station we were at and began to ask other passengers near her albeit quite loudly ( might have had a bit of a  mental problem)  but at least 4 people refused to tell her the station they were at , one did have earphones in so he could get a pass , but the other three simply looked the other way or  put their heads down, us , tourists had to go down to the middle of the carriage ( we were sat near the end) and tell her she was at whatever station we were at.

you probably don't want to have too many bank accounts open - it will be hard to keep track of anyway, and could potentially send mixed messages in terms of credit ratings etc. but there's no reason (and it is supposed to be quite easy these days) not to switch banks every couple of years or so.

the first thing you should do (my opinion) is to contact the existing ISA bank and find out what the interest rate they're giving you is. my guess is it is below 1%. if so, that can definitely be beaten, and probably while keeping the money in the cash ISA wrapper. chat with the bank staff and ask what they can do for you. then compare what they can offer with others online, and go with the biggest.

the other issue is a bit trickier - i get the impression that you want to start taking some risk with your money to get higher returns. that probably means investing in company shares etc. there's no problem doing that, and it could well be a great idea for you, but it is a far more open-ended discussion!

i have a bit of cash (not much because i'm working on paying off a mortgage!) in share ISAs, invested in passive funds. The funds are managed by a company called Vanguard, and i have the ISA with a company called Hargreaves Lansdown. The reason i do this is because passive funds have low fees (they don't employ fund managers to make decisions, they just follow the market passively). I have no real plans for this money, i just want it to increase in value over time, and i'm not averse to the idea that it might drop in value.

Anyone wanting to see more of what happens when they gain power should look into the 70s. Unions blocked ambulances from entering hospitals leading to deaths, rolling blackouts, blocked cemeteries so people couldn't bury loved ones, garbage piled up in Leicester Square tens of feet high etc. One of the nastiest institutions on the earth. 

For anyone doubting what I said about the unions in the 70s

&gt;No amount of ideological hogwash could cancel out the ugly encounters with actual people who held your family’s well-being in their hands: the train drivers who did not give a toss about our need to make a living, the power workers who shut off our lighting and heat when we had brought a new baby home from hospital, the council officials who locked our children out of school for six weeks in solidarity with striking caretakers.

&gt;Yes, there was uncleared snow on the roads, and yes, ambulances were turned away from casualty departments and electricity was only available on a rota.

Here are some more first hand accounts of the 70s http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6729683.stm

&gt;As a trainee engineer in 1976, I remember changing a toilet roll when on secondment to our Sheffield factory and being seriously worried that someone might find out and accuse me of doing somebody else's job. My predecessor had almost caused a strike by helping to sweep up some rubbish. The union's grip was total, and the atmosphere was poisonous. I don't agree with all that Margaret Thatcher did, but let's not pretend that drastic action was not required.

&gt;I don't remember all the political chaos, but I do remember playing Scrabble by candlelight and the fact that we couldn't bury my deceased grandfather. My mother never forgave Labour or the trade unions for that.

This allowed us to present a more private and intimate scene in a more private and intimate space. It was also helpful from a dramaturgical perspective, because we could use audience feedback from the subsequent Q&amp;A to see how people's attitudes to the characters had been shaped by the order in which they'd been introduced to them in those upstairs scenes.

With particular regard to greece, the single currency union might be the singlemost cynical aspect of the EU. Countries with their own currency have the option to devalue it nationally in order to attract trade from elsewhere. Lumped together into a single block countries of incredibly different economic strength have to twist and contort on a local level to fit the value of the euro. Germany essentially has ""its"" currency devalued by the presence of many other worse off nations sharing the same currency, so it manages to keep its exports high. Its the worst kind of manipulation of averages, cancelling out the single high anomaly with a plethora of much smaller values.

There are lots of other issues like the CAP and free movement - but I have no idea how I would alter those to be more representative or beneficial in anything like a fair manner (or at least so everyone is sufficiently aggrieved).

Well it sounds like they're trying to ""manage"" you out of the business to cut labour costs as you're only a student and thus are most expendable.  If you've been suspended on full pay, call in sick for a couple of weeks to stall for time before the hearing.  Then call the trade union anyway, ask them for advice as well.  Call and ask what information you should put on a letter and what you shouldn't.

If you start to control the process yourself, by rescheduling the ""meeting"" (it's a fucking hearing with a bozo manager acting as investigating officer and some idiot colleague taking notes only on behalf of the company, not you!) keeping everything in writing, answering no direct questions but referring them to the letter you have provided, they'll shit their pants.

Then I would further stall them by requesting that they give ""reasonable"" notice (wtf is reasonable?  There is a lawful notice period of a month in **lawful** correspondence before you can be seen to be dishonouring the contract) reschedule the hearing to a time when you can be represented by a union official so you can adequately provide the company with the accurate details they require for the efficient running of the business.  Then walk the fuck out of there.  

When I did it, they tried to intimidate me by conducting the hearing in a storeroom in the larger building not even connected to the restaurant I worked in.  The place was like a dungeon with a weird chain hanging from the wall, all they needed was Jack Bauer and some barbed wire to cheer the place up a bit.

Make sure you write your side of the story down and go into the hearing/investigatory meeting (I assume one is going to be properly conducted with some bozo appointed as investigating officer) essentially blaming it on them and their mismanagement of the store.  Your line manager, then the area manager.  Don't underestimate their innate incompetence.  They're relying on you being intimidated.

Don't get caught out because (upper) management are totally useless at their jobs and are letting shit roll downhill.  Definitely don't quit.  That would be the cheapest and best outcome for a money pinching greedy-assed business owner.

And you're a student, you're cheap as hell to hire so will get work anywhere else so just fuck with them for your own experience.

.......is my advice, take it or leave it.

P.S. and of course /u/CarpeCyprinidae is indeed the non adversarial way to go about it but you might still be fired because at some point you will have signed a contract to say you agree to abide by company policy.

That's (very approximately) £2 per kid per meal. Even when I was a lad (ending in 2000) the free school meal ticket some senior school kids got was worth 4 pounds. Of course school meals were shit and vastly over priced, but even then I doubt the cost was less than 1 pound...

I found this, which says the government spends more on prisoners than kids, 88p vs 67p for lunches. But the article has a few issues:

 * its not clear whether that includes what parents spend or whether it's just free school meal kids or what
 * Its from 2012, pre the desicion to give all infant kids free lunches
 * It goes on to say the same lunches cost £2 and a few other numbers

Asking for 320 pounds plus postage, has never been used as it's a warranty replacement that I replaced with a 980TI, you can see in the pictures that the sticker is still on the fans and it's still in its static bag, the reason I'm asking so little for it is because it's roughly what I'd get after eBay fees if sold there but I hate eBay so I'd rather someone else save some money than eBay get it.

&gt;Hi Guys ,
 As my first post here , I'm gonna try and be as precise as possible .
 I have a brand new , unused MOBO X99 Rampage V extreme ( was a gift ) and I don't want to invest to much money into a platform that i could use just for gaming .
 I am thinking of trading that MOBO + a hefty amount of £ for a z97 4790k build .
 Please let me know if any of you are interested .

Thanks

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (I report them in the table when they are), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

The estimates presented are based on a survey and as such are subject to sampling error. The uncertainty in the estimate is captured by the 95% confidence interval e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Items highlighted with * have more recent data available, so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

The situation has changed since then, though. A new owner at Villa can't just pump money into the club like the Mansours did for Man City. It won't have the same kind of payoff now. The threat of relegation is bigger for us than it was for them, too.

I reckon the problem at the moment for Villa is that we need too much of an initial investment from any new owner for the purchase to be worthwhile, and there's still the risk of us being relegated (as much as we would like to argue against that), losing massive amounts of money along the way.

If management can improve commercial revenue and the quality of the squad to be ""comfortably"" mid-table, that will reduce the risk, as well as the initial outlay required by a potential new owner, and we'll get a buyer in no time.

&gt;Hi there,

I am interested in an i7-5820k processor and I'm looking to pay £240, because for anything more I can get one sent over from America brand new. 

I'd also be interested in an i7-4790k if it's really cheap, otherwise I would rather get the 5820k.

I will be paying via PayPal, and I of course live in the UK.

Thanks.

Not really, since the formation you're suggesting is just a variation of a 4-3-3/4-5-1 anyway. It's basically how a typical 4-3-3 looks in the defensive phase.

When possession is lost, the wingers are normally expected to drop in to provide numbers in the midfield area and apply pressure to win the ball back (this is literally how the team was set up under Lambert). If not, the fullbacks are exposed to overloading and you're kind of fucked.

Once the ball is won back, those wingers have the pace to get forward and support the lone striker, and the team expands out to a wider shape to create space for the attack, forcing the defensive line to move in one direction while attacking the normally vacant channel on the other side.",null,0,null,1436955678,null,0,false,0,ct40149,null,t3_3d9rbz,null,t1_ct40149,null,t1_ct3b12w,null,null,null,1437867516,null,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

Breakdown of the ways in which TASER was used:
&gt;the police used Taser 10,062 times in 2014, representing a decrease of 3% (-318) compared with 2013; of these:

&gt;* non-discharges accounted for 8,081 uses, representing a fall of 3% (-279) compared with 2013
&gt;* drive stun and angle-drive stun accounted for 256 uses, representing a fall of 11% (-31) compared with 2013
&gt;* fired accounted for 1,724 uses, representing a fall of 1% (-9) compared with 2013
&gt;* non-discharges accounted for 80% of Taser use in 2014, with this mainly comprising of either the use of red-dot (64%) or an officer drawing the Taser (27%)
&gt;* drive stun and angle-drive stun accounted for 3% of Taser use in 2014 fired accounted for 17% of Taser use in 2014

Definitions of these uses:

&gt;| Level of use |	Type of use           | Definition |
|:-------------:|---------------------------:|-----------:|
| Highest Use |	Fired       |	The Taser is fired with a live cartridge installed. When the trigger is pulled, the probes are fired towards the subject with the intention of completing an electrical circuit and delivering an incapacitating effect.
| | Angle-drive stun |	The officer fires the weapon with a live cartridge installed. One or both probes may attach to the subject. The officer then holds the Taser against the subject’s body in a different area to the probe(s), in order to complete the electrical circuit and deliver an incapacitating effect.|
| | Drive stun | The Taser is held against the subject’s body and the trigger is pulled with no probes being fired. Contact with the subject completes the electrical circuit which causes pain but does not deliver an incapacitating effect.
| Non-discharges | Red-dot | The weapon is not fired. Instead, the Taser is deliberately aimed and then partially activated so that a laser red dot is placed onto the subject.
| | Arcing | Sparking of the Taser without aiming it or firing it.
| | Aimed | Deliberate aiming of the Taser at a targeted subject.
| Lowest use | Drawn | Drawing of the Taser in circumstances where any person could reasonably perceive the action to be a use of force.

I currently live and study in Dublin but I grew up in Belfast, it will always be home, but I'm honestly disgusted with it. We've come leaps and bounds the last 15 years or so, but there are some serious problems still, which we can see very clearly here. Racism is a very serious problem, the Loyalists are absolutely mad for it - you never hear about Republicans doing this sort of shite (SF is a left wing party so that's not really surprising).

I honestly believe that there is a silent majority up North who are sick to death of tribal politics and can't stand Stormont and shite that a tiny minority are putting us through. The moderate parties are absolutely useless and the extreme parties get most of the seats. I think a part of it is that you would get accused of bigotry if someone stands against the wave of neo-Loyalist extremism. Pages like Loyalists Against Democracy (LAD) are taken down because Loyalists take offence to being mocked and they have the gall to call us bigots - satire is probably the only effective method that can be used against these people since nobody has come out publicly to string them up. It perfectly highlights how many of these people are poorly educated and ass-backwards. They teach these values to their children, which will create a never ending cycle of hatred. 

On a another note, LAD has mocked Republicans too (Gerry Kelly being the prime example), but the fact that it's so rare says a lot about neo-Loyalism. It's sad that absolute ball bags like Willie ""Rent-a-Quote"" Fraizer and Jamie ""Seamy"" Bryson are given a podium and are respected by people. They are perfect examples of what's wrong with our wee country.

I've been asked a lot if I will move back home. I always tell them no. At least, I definitely won't move back after I finish my degree, and I don't see it happening within the next 5-10 years. Probably the main reason is the more abundance of good jobs in my field in Dublin (Programming/Software Engineering) and there are much bigger companies here, but another reason is NI's image - it's better than it was in most respects, but there are still people who insist on being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. It's embarrassing; this time of year I'm always ashamed to be Northern Irish.

We didn't get rent back - it didn't occur to us to ask! I spoke to my other half about making the agency put us up in a hotel while it was treated, but we didn't follow that up either - we were younger and a bit stupid to not push the agency harder (the arseholes tried to blame it on us and said we must have a pet hidden somewhere!). 


Good luck if you do approach them about returning rent - just keep a log of who you speak to if its an agency, how many times you call etc. Also try to take time-stamped pictures of the property/fleas/any bites you've got as evidence to present to them.


On a more practical note - each time you hoover, completely and fully empty the bag outside into your outdoor bin, so there's no chance they're in the hoover and getting out. Sounds silly, but fleas, despite their tiny size, are armoured fuckers and it takes loads to actually kill them - the hoovering process won't kill them, it'll just move them into your hoover :-/ 

Hot-wash what fabrics you can as long as it won't be shrunk/ruined - i.e. if you have removable sofa covers/cushion covers/rugs/curtains - they'll get everywhere. Likewise bedding - hoover your mattresses, wash clothes as hot as you can get away with.

Evidently yourself because those transgressions are arguably what created the Anglo-sphere? Modern Brits are no more responsible for our being ancestors of one of histories largest empires as potential migrants who are not ancestors of people who were subjects under that empire. 

I would argue that a Scandinavian has more in common than a citizen of many Commonwealth countries. Or even a qualified French doctor could offer more than a New Zealand factory worker.

Immigration should be judged on merit and not what passport the applicant already has. Many people from different nations maybe more *Anglicised* merely through watching TV than being born in a country that speaks English or has or had shared the same head of state, because I see that as useless arbitrary criteria. 

If we are completely objective about immigration, then frankly showing favouritism to our favourite little corners of the globe will in my opinion be counter productive.

I do agree with what you've said though. I used Google Sheets to manage all the finances on my house this year (not students but several seperate people living together). People could just add a row to a sheet to say they've paid in, and outgoings could be added elsewhere, and I made the sheet do the rest (eg, tells everyone what they owe).

Took a while to set up, and I still have the verify the ins and outs every month or so, but I plan on using basically the same format for the foreseeable future.

edit:

The sheet calculates everything at a sub-penny level. For the last 6 months there has been a rogue penny bouncing from person to person's owing amount.

One thing that always strikes me about ""A vehicle travelling at 70mph covers about ..."" is that it assumes you are able to relate a distance in meters to a specific situation when driving. As a matter of fact I have to use rules of thumb (mainly counting) to estimate relative distance at any given speed and knowing the absolute value is of little practical use.

Just to be clear, I have no affiliation with them, I've just admired their stance on censorship and privacy for a long time. The downside is, you get what you pay for: there are cheaper ISPs although they don't care about censorship or privacy and most of them require 12-24 month contract.

My brother uses Plusnet, it had/has a special offer where all he's paying is the line rental for a certain period. I've used this extensively, it is filtered and despite being fibre, the speed is rarely above 1-2Mb/s. It is cheap though. 

TalkTalk usually have some offers on at any given time and are popular because they're cheap. They filter and have consistently been at the bottom of consumer quality / satisfaction lists (most complaints to OFCOM, the ombudsman). I've had several family members and friends on TalkTalk and would recommend you steer clear! Really unreliable connection, bad customer service. It's always a case of YMMV of course but it isn't just an opinion, they've earned their reputation. 

I personally use Three and have a personal wifi hotspot via my phone. I am in a 4G area though. It's fast enough and cheap (pay as you go,  £15 pcm, unlimited internet, 3000 texts, 300 minutes). The connection can sometimes be flaky but nowhere near as bad as their reputation, it started off (years ago) as very flaky and became a joke, not been like that for a decade for me / my area, but it might be a good idea to check coverage online. They do filter some, but I don't know what the criteria is as I can access some porn, yet certain blogs gets randomly removed.

'Criticism[edit]
Blair has been subject to criticism for potential conflicts of interest between his diplomatic role as a Middle East peace envoy, and his work with Tony Blair Associates,[7][8][9] and a number of prominent critics have even called for him to be sacked from his peace envoy role.[10]

Blair has been subject to criticism after accusations of ""whitewashing"" the image and human rights record of the regime in Khazakstan.[5] In particular, opposition activists have published an open letter in a Kazak newspaper, Respublika, claiming Blair would have ""blood on his hands"" if did not stop assisting President Nursultan Nazarbayev.[citation needed] Blair has responded to such criticism by saying his choice to advise the country is an example of how he can ""nudge controversial figures on a progressive path of reform"", and has stated that he receives no personal profit from this advisory role.[11] The Kazakhstan foreign minister has said that the country was ""honoured and privileged"" to be receiving advice from Blair.[12][13]

Blair was reported to be have accepted a business advisory role with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, a situation deemed incompatible with his role as Middle East peace envoy;[14] Blair described the report as ""nonsense""'

If they abstained from voting, Labour (and probably others too) would call the SNP petty and narrow for not taking part in the democratic UK wide vote, too busy caring about themselves, ignoring the barbaric practices because of a border etc. etc.

If they did vote then the Conservative Party (who I distinctly remember begging Scotland to stay during the referendum) would point out (slightly ironically) that the SNP were voting on matters that they shouldn't be a part of (they didn't get any seats in England) and that English Votes for English Laws was the only way to stop this.

It's obvious to people that spend more than a cursory glance at it that it's not all that simple, there are multiple other more democratic and fairer systems yet those would lose the UK Government a lot of its power over the entirety of the UK (which they obviously don't want) where as the current EVEL implementation gives them power that they probably wouldn't get in a democratic regional parliament.

Although I disagree with the SNP voting on English matters in principle, in reality it's not all that simple and pledging to vote against the amendment was probably the best option for the SNP under the specific circumstances.

EVEL has certainly not been thought through and the constitutional issues that it's going to create are much larger than the issues that it's trying to fix, this can only really serve to drive a wedge between England and the other nations of the UK as they see themselves excluded from the democratic process and refused a vote on matters that affect their country.",null,0,null,1436960341,null,0,false,0,ct418qa,null,t3_3dd42s,null,t1_ct418qa,null,t1_ct40lqc,null,null,null,1437868353,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

question 2 - this is the way most people approach their mortgages. initial periods of 2-3 years then remortgage.  it isn't risk-free, as when you come to remortgage the world could be very different (different interest rates / house prices have gone up or down), and so it is possible that you will find it difficult to get a new loan. you should be aware of this when taking out the first mortgage, and make sure that you could afford the SVR if you can't find a new mortgage.

these days you can definitely get mortgages higher than 75% [see here for example](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/mortgages/search/results/?ltv=90.0&amp;goal=MOR_REM). whether they will lend to you is for the bank to decide, as credit scores and other factors will come into play. higher LTV is obviously higher risk - it takes a smaller house price move to put you under water.

Okay so all that happened in the 70s. Then thatcher busted them in the 80s. Since then union disruption has been exceptional. Why do they need busting again? This is 2015 not 1979.

[The Black Box](http://www.blackboxbelfast.com/) generally has an annual 'Devil Disco' which is pretty awesome. Weird music and Bacchanalian revelry.

Most bars will have some sort of Halloweeny function going on, and there are a couple of local Cramps/Misfits cover bands who generally play in some craphole or another, that's good fun.

If you think outside the box a bit too there's maybe some other fun to be had - maybe a horror flick in the [Tudor Cinema](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=tudor%20cinema%20comber) or a trip to [Crumlin Road Gaol](http://www.crumlinroadgaol.com/) for a ghost tour.

Whilst living in the UK, she met and married an American who was then working on a visa in the UK.  They decided to move to the US together, and she was able to get a spouse visa etc.

5 years later, they decided they wanted to move back to the UK - they had another kid, our father was ill, the better option was to be back here.

Because she had spent the last 5 years raising kids instead of working, they were unable to get a spouse visa for him, as they were unable to prove that she was able to support the family (In this case, the amount was closer to 28k) if he couldn't work.  They didn't care that he had a job offer, contingent on a work visa earning ~double this.  The home office refused to consider the case further.

So my sister, a UK citizen, was asked to make the choice between coming back to the UK or living with her husband.  As it happens, he was able (eventually) to get a job with a Tier 2 visa attached, but this means he can stay here only as long as he keeps this job.

I agree that we need some qualifying criteria for immigration, but the current system has caused some perverse outcomes and actually penalises UK citizens over other EU citizens (if my sister had been Spanish, bizarrely these rules would not have applied - EU freedom of movement over-rides them), and actively discriminates against women with children (if he had been the UK citizen, then there would have been no issue).",null,0,null,1436961223,null,0,false,0,ct41iqz,null,t3_3dcyri,null,t1_ct41iqz,null,t1_ct40r6n,null,null,null,1437868525,null,45,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,45,null

Coquelin- a good second half of the season and most people are talking him up likes he's the reincarnation of Dunga and Redondo.

Bellerin- Still way too much defensive flaws in his game and positioning which he just about covers due to his pace and strength similar struggles to our very own Spanish fullback who sometimes escapes criticism because he scored a nice goal. 

United

Luke Shaw- He's never a world record left back and has look worse than a makeshift LB in blind, still a very good player but vastly overpriced and overrated.

Manchester City

Clichy- a shocking LB who's only still playing for them because he's HG any half decent winger tears him to shreads i.e Mcmanaman in 2013.

Mangala- Awful defender, he probably got away with it in portugal because he's physically strong but his positioning and reading of the game is shocking.

How much you can borrow is more a factor of total income (or more accurately net income minus living costs) than it is deposit (although deposit vs loan value determines the LTV which is also a factor).

1. I'd wait to save for both the various application fees and for a larger emergency fund. The plan is otherwise not too bad - certainly nothing an extra few months can't sort out.

They've shown a complete lack of respect for Scotland with the devolution of powers after the referendum so it's understandable that the SNP are going to use what little power they do have in protest.

This nonsense could have easily been avoided if the Scottish Government was given the powers it was promised rather than the watered down proposals from the Smith Commission which were further watered down in Parliament with the Conservatives shooting down every suggested amendment from the SNP.

The attitude that bothers me about England primarily is that many are upset that Scotland has more devolution yet instead of fighting for further regional devolution within England, giving themselves a more accountable and targeted body of representatives, they cry and bawl for Scotland to lose what it has fought decades to get.

* Essentially the only vaguely impartial source of news in the country - Murdoch have an even tighter grip on what you know and think without it
* Most (all) of the terrestrial channels receive or have received in recent years significant amounts of license fee money
* With the competition from the BBC, pretty much the last restraint will be removed from advert funded channels and American levels of advertising will likely become the norm
* There's something fundamentally important about having programming made that isn't based solely on profit - there is a wealth of educational and informational programming that would never get made and benefits everyone - enormous amounts of nature documentaries of an unparalleled quality, for example
* 33% of all TV watched in the UK is BBC - people may not want to pay the fee, but they damn well want to consume the media
* The number 1, 2 and 3 radio stations in the UK are all BBC stations - if we dismantle the BBC about 35 million listeners a week lose their stations of choice
* 96% of the British population consume content provided by the BBC every week. I'm willing to be 9/10 people who post in these threads saying ""I don't want to pay the license fee, I don't watch BBC"" still find benefit from the BBC

The bottom line is the BBC acts for the common good and provides huge amounts of enjoyment to a huge range of people.

Based on all of this I think part of his initial loan contract was an agreement to extend the loan deal for another year. Fiorentina probably invoked this clause in the contract, Chelsea accepted and were payed the loan fee. The problems arose when Salah refused to return to Fiorentina therefore possibly breaking the terms of the contract and in turn creating problems for Chelsea.

A lot of this is based on rumours so it could be wrong so I could be wrong but this is how I see it anyway.

Last season, towards the end of the season, Bayern were struggling, and had they not already won their league, may have lost Pep his job. Last season, when Chelsea were playing poorly, Jose pulled the team together and won us the league. In my opinion what needs to be strengthened is the squad, not the starters. A player who can rotate and play with consistency is needed, not a player who will demand a starting spot immediately. This is why, in my opinion, Pedro would be a perfect signing. Here is a guy who can come in and play in the place of Oscar, Willian, or Hazard. A guy who can also start in place of any of those players without much drop off in talent.

I'm not sure if Cuadrado was every truly meant to fit into the starting XI, I think that's something us fans came up with on our own. Schurrle expressed his desire to leave, and with him gone, we were in need of a winger for depth to finish off the season. I think Cuadrado was signed because he did impress in Italy, and because he works hard in defense. As we saw, we were forced to rotate even less in the second half of the season because we didn't have a winger that was comfortable enough to come on. I wouldn't say he was a panic buy, but Cuadrado was certainly a player that we needed right there and then, and it simply didn't work out.  

That being said, I think Pedro is a much much better player than Cuadrado. Proven to be consistent and quality on the biggest stages of the sport. He's a La Masia graduate, and one that broke into the first team at Barca for many years before being forced out by Suarez. I don't think we should expect him to start, but I think he can push Willian and Oscar to keep consistency, and it gives Mourinho a damn good option off the bench instead of settling for a player he might not be comfortable with.

I've often thought about selling my car but there are times where I do still need it, when I'm working late, going to play sports, seeing my parents on the odd weekend etc.


&amp;nbsp;

The main problem is it's a load of small little things I've accumulated over a year. I pay £700 towards rent and bills, about £100-£150 in petrol (I commute with my boyfriend, he uses his car so I pay 1/2 of his petrol each month on top of mine – which isn't a huge amount,  I usually fill up once a month in my car which is only £45), about £100 on food and then £100 on other commitments like my phone, car tax, RAC etc). Previously on my old salary that left me with roughly £250 for the month (which totally sounds like something I could live off, but it's the little £20 withdrawals going to the pub quiz and buying bloody sandwiches instead of making lunch that probably did it... I'm now making lunches and not withdrawing money anymore, I used to just lose it in loose change).

&amp;nbsp;

I've jacked in going to the gym and I'm currently taking a break from the sport I play which has freed up £75. I'm not allowing myself to do stupid girly things like buying clothes (except for a dress for a work do... I hate dress codes, but that was only £35).


&amp;nbsp;

I may go and talk to Natwest about my overdraft, see what's happening with it and if I can have an agreed limit. The new amount I'm making will probably kick in the next few months, again, if I'm sensible and instantly write £200 off of my spreadsheet for the car. I was just wondering if I put petrol onto a 0% card next month to pay off in September if that would offset the problem and address it... I have no big expenditures facing me in September, already told my boyfriend I don't want to go on a long weekend to Europe because I can't afford it (much to his annoyance, so sympathetic).

null,false,NEWSBOT3,null,null,null,"i would personally be very very wary of house price inflation. In my lifetime i've seen houses go up and down hugely, and i'm only in my 30s! 

my parents house was at one point worth 120k - it was down to 70k a few years later when they separated, and by the time that was done, she got half the value minus fees and bought a 2 bed terrace for 23k with very little left over.
That 23k house was once worth maybe 80k , but it's been dropping for several years and is now closer to 60k and dropping all the time. Allowing for inflation, it's basically the same price now as was when she bought it.  


Your parents (and mine say the same) have seen that historically a lot of people have done very well from rising house prices. At some point that's going to stop - I don't think it will stay as it is for a 20 or 30 year mortgage term. There's an increasingly rising demand to fix the UK's housing problem, and when that starts being taken seriously, house prices will have no choice but to nosedive in response. 


my own plan is to find a place I can afford with a 25%+ deposit, pay the mortgage and overpay it so it's paid off in 10-15 years at most, and then have another 10-15 years of earning without the expense of rent or mortgage payments. I don't really care if my house is worth nothing at that point, as long as I own it in full. Because once I do, my income requirements are far smaller (my mum manages fine on state pension which is like 8k/year) - which makes it much easier to retire earlier should I want to, or take lower paying less stressful jobs if i get sick etc.",null,0,null,1436967743,null,0,false,0,ct447ur,null,t3_3dd5je,null,t1_ct447ur,null,t3_3dd5je,null,null,null,1437869940,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

I'm so tired of a bazillion posts all saying the exact same thing. 

Lets finish this once and for all.

&gt;Benteke is only useful for crosses and long balls. 

False, that is just how Villa have played for the past 3 season, it does not mean that is his greatest strength.

&gt;Liverpool don't cant/dont cross. 

False, we can cross, we just havent had someone on the team for a while who could take advantage of crosses and long balls or win aerial duels.

&gt;Benteke doesnt run into passes behind.

False, Villa don't play a style in which he gets much of an opportunity to do so. Watch him play for Belgium, play a closer game to ours that Villa does.

Heres the simple thing for me, Benteke is a player who can:

* Score with his left
* Score with his right
* Score with his head
* Score from inside the box
* Score from outside the box
* Has shown the ability to score against top teams(while playing for a shit side)
* Fairly decent with the ball in terms of dribbling
* Is a threat during corners
* Is a threat when taking set pieces
* Is a threat when in the box during a set piece
* Is the right combination of physical and pacey (I mean pacey for his size, not Firmino/Sterling/Ibe pacey)
* Can occupy 2 defenders making space for attacking mids or another striker


Yes, he is expensive. None of us here want to pay 32.5m for him.

No he isnt injury prone, he has had only 2 injuries in his 3 years in the EPL, one of which was due to a bad tackle during training (could have happened to anyone). Yes, he had a slow recovery from his last injury and went into a scoring drought.

No, there aren't many better options available. No, I'm not happy paying 32.5m for him but it looks like we'll have to. We held out on Sterlings ~50m they will hold out for their ~32.5m. 

Yes, Lacazette or Aubameyang would be better options but they aren't available.

No, they aren't not available because of lack of ambition, we don't have huge money, huge wage budgets, recent trophies or champions league to offer. Thats why they arent available.

If she was the earner, and so they got a spousal visa for him (or he was the UK national), if the UK earner subsequently lost her job, then we would support them.  So we have a set of rules that actively penalise against the fact that she took time off work to raise their kids (so much for ""family values"").  If it was a family income requirement, it would immediately remove this issue.

Also, prior to them moving to the states, he worked in the UK for over 10 years, earning a decent whack and paying a chunk of that to HMRC, as he should.  She had also worked over here prior to them moving to the US and having another kid as well.  The Home Office would not take any of this into account.

Also, back for ~1 year now, and household income of &gt;150k - this is two skilled professionals who we wouldn't let in because one of them was non-EU and the UK citizen hadn't earned enough in the last year.  The system is fundamentally flawed.

It's been linked to being fat.  Which is blamed on eating fat.

Low calorie diets are often high in carbs.

&gt; No offence, but it's taught in middle/high school biology.

Well you are ahead of the curve then; as the medical establishment is only just getting around to the idea that diabetes can be treated with a low-carb diet (rather than low-calorie).  (Did you watch the video I linked to -- that's a diabetes doctor talking about her experiences using ""unusual"" low carb diets).

I agree completely that it's taught in high school.  The odd thing is the difference between what everybody knows about the biochemistry of it (which is as you say), and the advice about macro diet.

Saajan kebab house in Fallowfield, opposite Sainsbury's. BEST KEBAB EVAR! There is one more on the Curry Mile, same owners.

Check out Arndale Market for food.

La Suerte dance school - check out their Salsa courses. Great way to meet interesting people. Also, dirt cheap for a student, less than 5 quid per lesson.

Go to some of the nicer places around Spinningfields on a sunny day - a little pricier than the student areas but well worth it.

Avoid the student gyms such as Sudgen Sport Centre and Aquatics Centre - they are cheaper but therefore packed to capacity at all times students find convenient. Instead, pay a bit extra and go to premium gyms like Bannatyne's, you won't regret it.

The other new research is that fructose (found in sugar, but not complex carbs) is directly toxic on the liver and disrupts the function of insulin. 

Finally, there is further brand new research which shows that recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes can often be cured by serious weight loss. This may mean aiming for a BMI of around 19-20, but preliminary results are dramatic, if started early enough.

Depends on exactly how much they claim.  If they go for the minimum then it will cost £80 to issue the claim or £70 if they do it online.  If a hearing is required then an additional £115 hearing fee would be due.

Some or all of these fees may waived if the claimants are on benefits or a low income.

HOWEVER if the claimant wins then most if not all of those fees will be added on to the judgement so you'll end up paying them.

The same 13yo put them all down yeah?

&gt;Same goes for the countless loyalists that march in memory of fallen soldiers who fought nazism.



&gt;As for racism in loyalist areas you have to acknowledge that loyalist areas typically have cheap rent and overall have more ethnic minorities. 

Pity they don't march for the nationalist who fought, given there were more of them.

Do they have 90% of the immigrants? Because they have 90% of the blame.

Perhaps instead of attempting to dissolve a group of blame, you'd be better off to actually accept it, condemn it, and fight against it. Whataboutism is pathetic, and sticking your head in the sand pathetic.

I was one of them. Of course, that isn’t to say that hard work isn’t somehow not part of the equation. It most certainly is, but it’s a combination of talent and hard work that enables great art.

This isn't even to tackle the obvious point that, had we gone left to win votes in Scotland (which wouldn't have worked) we'd have then lost more votes to the right in the rest of the country (and, indeed, Scotland).

As for my Foot/Miliband comparison, I'm going to phrase it as a quiz show question:

&gt;Which leader of the Labour Party took over as leader after a general election loss by a former-Chancellor-turned-PM who'd never won one, was perceived as very left-wing by the public, failed the 'blink test', was unable to deal with the insurgency of another left-of-centre party, played to what he thought his party's strengths were, and, despite taking on a government with a damning record of economic failure, ended up with even fewer seats than his predecessor?

I know I'm stretching my point a little by saying Corbyn and Miliband are *both* heirs to Foot, but I don't think it's entirely spurious.

I'm not saying the rest of the UK is any different or that you shouldn't have what you do, but we listened to a lot of ""we'll take what we want and fuck the rest of you"" from the SNP in the run up to the referendum.

I can understand this completely. The whole campaign really did bring out the worst in everyone some times.

**I'd like to help you.**

First you should buy some nice crunchy rolls from your local shop/supermarket/baker.   They will be about 10cm x 10cm (4"" x 4"")

What you should do is get a frying pan (buy one), and cook for probably around 8-10 minutes on medium heat (low then high is popular but let's keep it simple, it's your first go!)

5 minutes before your bacon is ready, you should put the rolls into the oven.

When the bacon is ready, remove the rolls, cut them in half and put the bacon in the middle.  Probably 3 rashes per roll.  You should add sauce to taste (tomato, brown, HP, barbecue, mayo, whatever -- tomato is most popular).

Finally, when all of this is made, you should invite me round and we can eat delicious bacon rolls together.",null,0,null,1436972680,null,0,false,0,ct470rr,null,t3_3dai96,null,t1_ct470rr,null,t3_3dai96,null,null,null,1440478768,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Then you can spray them with a waterproofing spray or wash them with a waterproofing liquid. It should improve things a lot.

We've improved all over the place. We're 1 top class striker and maybe a solid, reliable left back from having a squad deep enough and good enough to challenge for top 4 and trophies at the same time.

If you then factor in hopefully not having Sturridge injured for 80% of the season, and Lallana injured for 30%, then it's pretty damn clear we are in a much better spot than last season. 

Then you also consider that we have one of the youngest squads in the league, so every season our players will improve a lot naturally, moreso than older squads like City's who are more likely to deteriorate between seasons; Henderson is a year older and better, as is Coutinho, etc.

Quite possibly, but I expect they'll be fairly cautious about using powers like that for the first time - particularly as they'll only have control of about 40% of tax revenue.

That makes it difficult for them to do the normal approach that governments take of hiding away unwelcome tax increases in amongst another taxes.

&gt; The SNP won't collapse and will probably still be the largest party, but I don't see how they won't piss off at least a part of their current supporters.

Oh, of sure. Part of their current support is a backlash against the referendum and post-referendum behaviour of the other parties and that will fade over time regardless.

I never defended executive pay, I lambast it just as much, but we were discussing unions in this thread.

&gt;Everyone consults people and reaches a consensus before going forward. You know why the unions never strike over there Because they don't have to. Companies in Sweden provide a great range of benefits to their staff willingly. 

&gt;There's is an argument that this makes Swedish companies uncompetitive, which has some credence, but trying to compare Sweden to somewhere like the UK or France is pretty funny.

Yep Ikea, H&amp;M, Electrolux, Paradox Interactive are all massively uncompetitive. So I don't buy that argument as much, although I do agree with the system over here in that's it's great when you get a job. It's just hard to actually get a full time job where you get all those benefits. Because of said system.

Also why not compare Sweden to the UK and France? We're all in Europe, classed as western nations. Pretty comparable to me

&gt; Your time in the military has nothing to do with this. You lived and breathed an organisation that is rigid and inflexible, and largely hires people who have nothing better to do with their life.

Well that's a generalisation if ever I heard one. I had a place at university to study Accounts/French dual honours, but instead chose to get myself a trade. Most of my colleagues also did this so that we would have a skill set that would come in handy in later life.

Also there were plenty of people who came from deprived backgrounds or could only make a living through crime. A small handful were reasonably intelligent, the majority though were incredibly stupid, bear in mind they could barely commit crimes competently.

That people enjoy dividing the world into us vs them is always going to be true, however it is certainly a step forward to look at systems that try and reduce that rather than encourage it.

The voting system is a good example - Scotland would have used AMS, as it currently does for its parliament, rather than FPTP.

FPTP tends to lock us into a two-party system where governments get voted out as much as they do voted in, and smaller parties - who nevertheless represent large numbers of people - rarely get a look in.

This week's Survation poll for Holyrood 2016 voting intention puts the Green party on about 6 seats, the Lib Dems on 6 seats, Conservatives on 17, Labour 30, and SNP 70. The SNP still form the government, but there will be a far wider range of opinion within that chamber than the Conservative vs Labour politics the UK has  - because the idea that voting Green or Lib Dem is a wasted vote no longer holds.

&gt; For instance, a policy like free prescription charges would get a much different reaction in a Scotland 20 years after independence than the near universal support which it has seen, because it is genuinely difficult to decide what is the right thing to do - by going from a means tested to a universal system, you are helping some people who are vulnerable but aren't able or willing to claim, but you are also giving a lot of money to a lot of people who don't need it.

I'm not so sure it would - you would also be dealing with a smaller population where means testing becomes intrinsically less efficient.

Within England almost [90% of prescriptions are free](http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/nhs-prescription-charges), so in that country the question of ""should we means test everyone even though we know 90% of them fall outside it anyway?"" is as much an ideological one as a ""can we afford it?"" one.

&gt; That policy in the independence scenario would be the subject of wearying and interminable debate, and a large percentage of the population would disagree whatever was done.

null,false,tylersburden,null,null,null,"I think that people on the whole like the BBC and its general output, but the funding method is now completely anachronistic. People are not tied to houses and fixed screens like they were in the twentieth century. I think that supplying funds from general taxation is inappropriate for an independent BBC and that somehow introducing a new licence fee with a wider scope that included internet connections would be disastrous and that all credibility and goodwill that the BBC currently engenders would rapidly dissipate especially amongst the people in their twenties and teens now who are moving into houses (if they can!) on their own. The current choice is pretty ridiculous (TV, or no TV oh and you can’t watch any live broadcasts even for non-BBC channels) but the prospect of the fee being applied to laptops, phones and tablets for TV on demand (like iPlayer) is absolute insanity. By all means lock iPlayer up and only allow paying customers to see it but don’t keep it open for all and apply a hugely wide reaching blanket fee for it. 

If a national broadcaster introduced a new regressive poll tax today in which people in locked bedrooms had to pay as well as the national householder under pain of imprisonment there would be national rioting and pandemonium. Yet this is exactly what the situation is under the BBC and it is only acceptable due to historical precedence, apathy and BBC cultural input as to what “great value” it is. 

When the country broadcasting switched from analogue to digital, the BBC had a great opportunity to switch to encrypted channels via new TVs and set top boxes but I suspect that they felt that it was too much of a risk of losing their licence fee revenue stream.

&gt;A while back when I bought my new Aivia keyboard, I wanted my mouse and mat to also match, and since my Razer Naga was failing at the time, it seemed like a good choice. 

However, I neither liked the feel of the mat itself, or the mouse. It felt too big for my hands, which are not the largest, so the same day I bought a new Naga and I was planning to return the mouse and mat. I decided to store them, in case I ever needed an emergency spare but recently realised there's no point in that. Links are here to their specs:

Mouse: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gigabyte-8200dpi-Adjustable-Krypton-Chassis/dp/B008GDKMO2

Mat: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gigabyte-Krypton-Sided-Mouse-Mat/dp/B008J4QNJQ/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436975439&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=gigabyte+kyrpton+mat

I don't trust delivering such items over Reddit, so I'm afraid I can only accept collection or a meet up in my town centre (Leeds).

Items are in new condition as they only received a few hours use before I decided they were not for me :P

&gt; Another Labour peer, Lord Desai, suggested bizarrely that patients should be issued with an ""Oyster card"" which is deducted whenever a patient uses healthcare, and patients should receive a ""bill"" at the end of the year, saying this would “help make it clear to people that a free National Health Service is not a costless one.""

There's also an ingrained hatred of the Tories, which stems not so much from ideological differences as the Tories' quite genuine history of ignoring and neglecting the Scots.

The YouGov findings are, as the author admits, not in line with other findings and didn't actually use a very good methodology. The more recent British Social Attitudes Survey found that there was virtually no evidence that the Scots were to the left of the rest of the country, even on supposedly totemic issues like Trident, austerity and tuition fees.

So, in fact, it's the 'The SNP won because they're left-wing' answer that's a) lazy and b) inaccurate. The 'No, they won because they're nationalists' answer might not cover all the necessary ground, but at least it's starting out on the right track.

My detailed answer is that they won because the deck is rigged. They realised they could push for headline policies that would never actually happen (like scrapping Trident) or were actually shit at doing what they said on the tin (like scrapping tuition fees to help poor kids -- it doesn't), but would win votes and make them stand out from Labour. Then when anyone says, 'Hang on, but Scotland's still got all the same problems as England and you've done nothing -- *nothing* -- to fix them', they get away (so far) with implying that 'if only' they could get away from the UK they could actually sort things out.

EDIT: I should be clearer about Trident: Saying 'We'll scrap Trident' is win-win for the SNP because people who want it scrapped all vote for it and people who don't want it scrapped know they can't actually make it happen so they can safely vote for them.

Basically during the civil war this guy was the head of the Armed Forces and when the Taif Agreement went through, which is like Lebanon's Good Friday Agreement he didn't accept it causing further Civil War. Anyway! So Lebanon have a similar situation to us whereby first minister and deputy first have to be from opposing sides: Though theirs is much stricter religious divide (christian/muslim) whereas ours is more nationalist/unionist. I know sometimes they're synonyms here but still.Anyway so basically this guy Michele Aown is the head of the Christian party here and in choosing the next president (who has to be Christian) he got the most votes. Unfortunately for him he didn't get enough to pass the threshold because he's a bit of a lunatic (as shown during the civil war) and you need cross party agreement.SO in protest, Michele Aown has completely pulled himself and his party out of parliament and because there's a law where the government can't vote without a certain number of MPs present (which it now fails to get without Aowns ministers there) it means that the entire government has been non-functional for nearly two years and the country without a president.The march was to show that the people of Lebanon were behind Aowns decision and they were supposed to flood the streets in Orange as support but it was a disaster, no one showed up and in his press conference afterwards when someone asked him why his allies hadn't shown up he shouted at them saying ""Don't ask about my allies.""

Looking at some of the cases in the article it seems there is some confusion over when you are required to pay. The tvl website does say simply that you need a license if you receive any live TV broadcast. The letters they send though don't state it as simply, as I recall. Many people may not have access to internet or may not think to check the website as they have no reason to doubt their own interpretation of the law.

The law is pretty messy, such that a tv license is required to receive live broadcasts from overseas, or that the difference between breaking and complying with the law may simply be whether the laptop you're watching live TV on is plugged in or not. I imagine quite a few people in the courts genuinely thought they didn't need to pay because they don't watch bbc, or they're receiving shows from abroad. Likewise there are probably people who pay when they don't need to, eg if they think simply owning a tv that they don't watch live shows on means they need to pay.

Personally I'm against the license but I think it at least needs to be seriously changed. When people are talking about making access to the internet or contraception a human right, it seems silly to me that poor people are denied access to all live television, which can be a major source of news and information.",null,0,null,1436979238,null,0,false,0,ct4bbwy,null,t3_3dd7dh,null,t1_ct4bbwy,null,t1_ct42cn2,null,null,null,1437874019,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You cannot win a general election in 2020 with policies that would have appealed to the left in 1947. Miliband learnt it the hard way, and Miliband was like Corbyn-lite.

The only two people that are electable labour leaders are Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper. The former is somewhat tarnished by his association with the Mid Staffs scandal but realistically that will probably brush aside since there isn't any serious accusation that it wasn't his fault. The latter is always going to be held back by her association with her husband and labours grand arch-fuckstain Ed Balls. Liz Kendall leans slightly too far to the right, and her mannerisms and debating style is irritating, I don't think the public will take to her.

&gt;Worked in a schools IT Dept as a sysadmin till march.
This article is just shit stirring. Schools have had this software in place for fucking years, if not Impero then something like Securus. And you know what? Its completely fucking necessary.

&gt;When you drop your little darlings off at school you give over a duty of care to said children, meaning the school has a responsibility to ensure the child is in a protected environment. Guess what? The internet isn't a lovely land of rainbows and sunshine, you categorically need software like Impero because its the best at what it does. Its basically a glorified word list that integrates with AD, you set the policy that you want, i.e. the word ""porn"" and in the event of that word appearing on someones screen it will send a little prompt to the admin, it will also normally take a screenshot or start recording their screen. It can close the window on their computer, it can blank their screen or disable their mouse/keyboard inputs. Its fantastic at what it does.

&gt;It comes prepackaged with words like ""cutting"" or ""self harm"" because its specifically designed for a school environment where young teenagers may be experiencing abuse or bullying so i ask is it still wrong to track these kind of things? It will also flag up extremist content by default (which is no different from what the guardian is saying its only implementing now) whether it be about ISIS or the KKK.

&gt;Now as 1984 as this sounds, because of said duty of care us horrible Nazi Mods are 100% forced to use this software because if little Timmy stumbles on videos of people getting their heads cut off and doesn't like it and tells his parents you can bet your bottom dollar they will be down at the school in a flash complaining.
As totally lovely (and time saving) it would be to not have to implement these policies on the entire network, if you're under 18 then no you probably shouldn't be looking at GTA V, school is also not a good place for gambling, watching porn, torrenting or using TOR.

&gt;Also, tracking software (impero) monitors your usage, proxies block sites

with relevance to the article yes its an obvious problem and is completely on imperos head. However the server the one i used was located in a forest of servers hanging off the DC, behind a firewall, an enterprise level antivirus as well as a managed IDS residing on a switch further up the network. Its not like you could simply telent in to it and have carte blancé with the entire network.

Firstly, it's extremely expensive. You don't notice this so much if you're an employee, but if you're self-employed, you'll be giving them 14% of your income. And you have to predict what your income for the next year will be in advance. So if you earn less than you thought you would, you'll be getting a hammering from them when you can least afford it. Sure, you can claim back what you paid in excess *eventually*, but that's no good to you when your earnings for the month were zero and they're still expecting their regular payment.

And then when it comes to actually getting some healthcare - nightmare. You see, some genius has decided that what sick or injured people really want is choice. So you've a choice of insurance providers, and a choice of who you go to for treatment.

Great, right? Competition is good, isn't it?

No. How do I choose who treats me? Am I qualified to assess their abilities? No. Do I even know what treatment I need? No, that's why I'm looking for medical help. Is there unbiased information available on which to base a decision? Not really. So I'm more likely to make a bad choice than a good one.

So here's how it goes. Your GP checks you out and says ""I can't tell what's wrong here, you need to see an orthopaedic specialist."" No referral, find one yourself. Choice is good, remember? 

So you Google for one in your area and choose the one with the soonest appointment because you're in agony and can hardly walk. They check you out - only after handing over your insurance details, of course - and tell you they can't work out what's up either and you need an MRI scan. ""How do I arrange that?"" ""Here's a sheet of A4 with all the clinics in the area, pick one, choice is good"". Yeah, thanks.

So I start ringing round. Most won't see me for six weeks at least. Great, thanks. After a dozen phone calls, one can see me in ten days. Is that good? Will the next one on the list see me sooner? I don't know. So I have to call them ALL to find out which will take me quickest, and THEN call back the best option to make an appointment, hoping that it hasn't been taken in the hour I've spent ringing round.

And then their results are inconclusive and the orthopedic specialist tells you you shouldn't be in that much pain and you say ""well I am, so how about fixing it?"" And they give you a cortisone injection and tell you to GTFO and that's all the treatment you ever get.

So you end up doing what you can yourself and a year later it's still not 100%.

This is the same argument against euthanasia and forced sterilization - worthy arguments. But these same arguments are also used to prevent assisted dying, which most people understand is a more subtle distinction. 

Black and white / binary decisions very rarely exist in the world of ethics.

Discriminating between people and their health care, based on wealth or education is obviously offensive ... except, in some sense, we already do. Some hospitals / localities are better than others. If there is an alternative model that can raise health care across the board and, at-least begin to narrow these health provider gaps, don't we have a responsibility to do this?

On a more individual, personal level, why should I be denied health care when I live a careful and disciplined lifestyle because the needed resources are instead being funneled into smoking diseases, into diseases of obesity ...? I wouldn't begrudge these *irresponsible* people from seeking insurance, but I don't expect to also be held accountable for their lifestyle choices when I've made difficult choices.

Canterbury - small medieval city with a Cathedral, large student population, many pubs, a relaxed attitude.

Mountains - not as large as those in some countries but very beautiful and easily accessible. Basically, mid and north Wales (I'd recommend staying in Beddgelert or Caernarfon), the Lake District (Ambleside is the main hub, good camping and walks in Borrowdale, Great Langdale, Wasdale, or the lowlands between Coniston and Windermere), or Scotland (a lot to choose from but I'd recommend Fort William or Skye).

Moorland: North Yorkshire, Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Penines.  Huge expanses of unfarmed land.

Cliffs and beaches: Purbeck, Cornwall &amp; N Devon, most of the Welsh coastline.

You might like the Yorkshire Dales - similar to the rural Cotswolds but more rugged.

Avebury is worth a visit.

If you like the idea of renting somewhere unique (a castle, lighthouse, a giant stone pineapple, or just a beautiful country cottage), look at the Landmark Trust - they have a few smaller properties that aren't too expensive.

Notting Hill Carnival is fun if you aren't tired of London. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is awesome, but accommodation is expensive. Sidmouth Folk week is odd and mad - thousands of traditional musicians and dancers take over a small town in Devon for a week. There are many, many festivals in the summer, whatever you like there's one for you.

I'd agree that the data protection act probably prevents the from confirming that somebody was awarded a degree, but based on the above, they should be well aware that they cannot award degrees so it's a little strange that they wouldn't just say that.

I'm planning to build a new PC, but I need to sell this little warrior to save up a little. The parts are all in good working and aesthetic condition. It's a nice machine, but I need an upgrade for the stuff I'm going to be doing from now on.

I’ve OC’d the CPU to 4.2GHz using AMD software and I’m sure you could push it further if you’re bothered. I’ve tweaked the GPU too using the MSI Afterburner.

**Location: Greater London, UK.** Send me an email at [husseinhorack@gmail.com] if you're going to buy some of this and I will have a chat with you about delivery costs, etc.

**PRICES**
AMD FX-6350 3.9GHz 6-core: £70
MSI R9 280 Gaming 3GB TWIN FROZR: £135
MSI 970 Gaming ATX AM3+ Motherboard: £60
Corsair Vengeance Pro 8GB DDR3 1866MHz: £30
EVGA SuperNOVA NEX 650W 80+ Gold: £50
**TOTAL: £400**
sold: ram, motherboard, cpu
I spent £587 on this when I bought it. I did include a case, HDD CPU cooler and optical drive though, but they’re not the most expensive parts. The memory, for example, cost me £70 originally. You get it for £30 as the price went down a lot (now £45). The GPU is worth £168, and so on.

Anyway, whatever it is you buy, whether it’s the whole lot or just one part, I hope you enjoy it as I did!

It is however a way of teaching the labour party a lesson. The main field of candidates is incredibly weak.

I never bought anyone in the first season, I actually sold Lovren, Allen, Balotelli, Borini and Lallana. I didn't buy anyone and just brought wisdom, origi and flanagan up and ended up winning the league and FA Cup. I did play all the matches tweaking the tactic throughout according to the opposition, it also helps alot if you rotate quite a bit and keep the morale up. Never have anyone lacking match fitness either because it matters more than you might think.

Was still shitting myself because im just bad under test conditions.

Still got a pass with 2 minors (1 for the stall and one for emergency brake not being quite good enough, although i was actually going faster than the limit and it was raining)

Then had about a total of 4 hours mod 2 practice.

The fact that you're even asking demonstrates that you're missing the point. With even a basic understanding of the limits to empirical research in sociology you probably wouldn't even be asking. 

Few other points to get the juices flowing: Do you not think that the timing of a survey is relevant to know? The questions that were asked? What other surveys recorded?

**Spurs**

Over-rated: Jan Verthongen. He's never had a solid partner with him, but he always looks like he's about to get sent off and hasn't really stood out to me as the player everyone thinks he is. I'd take Skrtel &amp; Sakho over him any day.

Under-rated: Ryan Mason, that guy's going to be huge one day. Really enjoy watching him play when I get the chance.

**Chelsea**

Over-rated: Diego Costa. Great striker, no denying. But I don't think he's in the same league as Suarez, Lewandowski, Aguero, Benzema etc. which is the impression I get from Chelsea fans.

Under-rated: Gary Cahill. He gets a lot of shit, but when you're in a two man defense with John Terry at the moment, he'd make anyone look poor. Like Henderson with Gerrard, I think Cahill will be better once he's allowed to move out of Terry's shadow.

**United**

Over-rated: It's got to be Fellaini hasn't it? He's fucking dump.

Under-rated: Chris Smalling. I actually think he's a half decent defender on his day. He's got a long way to go, but I don't think he's given a huge amount of credit by many.

**Arsenal**

Over-rated: Coquelin. If he continues his form into next season, I'll concede and I'll be wrong, but I don't think he's going to. He had one good season, he is **not** the next Makelele.

Under-rated: Giroud. He's pretty ridiculously good.

**City**

Over-rated: Sterling!!111 jk. Yaya Toure. I think City waste a lot of faith and resources on an aging player who for the 3 minutes of a game where he gives a fuck he's effective. If they end up with a player like Nainggolan in their side they'll be completely different and very difficult to stop.

Under-rated: Aguero. We all know he's fucking brilliant, City fans know it, everyone does. But I don't think he's ever been in a TOTS since arriving at City, despite being one of the best strikers in the world.

**Everton**

Over-rated: Ross Barkley. He's seriously stagnated recently.

&gt;1) Is my plan of 6-8 months viable? Should I wait longer given I am renting now at £620/month, which will increase to £660/month after 6 months from now. Obviously I would need to find a suitable property too.

Probably. You also need to have savings for all the stuff like moving, furniture, unexpected bills (boiler, etc...) you'll also have council tax, insurance, mortgage insurance, etc...


&gt;2) Mortgages. I've done some comparing and research, and have found that most building societies tend to give a much better deal. However these tend to run for 24-26 months, after which you switch to an SVR. I would be looking for a mortgage with no early termination fee, so that I can re-mortgage to another tracker/fixed rate for another 2 years and keep doing that. Am I right in thinking that's doable?

Yes. Once the 2 year fix expires, you're free to remortgage and start a new fixed mortgage. That's the 'done' thing. Use a mortgage advisor. I used one and they got a deal exclusive to them and took their fee from the mortgage lender. Well worth it, and saved us £000's over the term of the fix.


&gt;Most mortgages I've looked at seem to take my £50k deposit and offer me up to £150k loan at a 75% LTV ratio. But in other threads, I've been people getting £150-180k loans with just a 20k deposit. Could someone enlighten me on this?

Different mortgages have different conditions. A smaller deposit requirement generally means a higher % rate. More deposit = smaller % interest rate.

&gt;Ideally I would like a mortgage with no over payment charge as well, as I plan to keep adding to my payments, helping me pay off the mortgage sooner. I would rather pay back the debt + interest, rather than just interest.

Generally all mortgages will have some sort of condition attached to overpayment. Mine allows up to 10% with no fee.

Encryption:
&gt;In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it.

If the government forces all encryption methods to have back doors then it is impossible for you to encrypt something that can't be decrypted by the government - an unauthorized party, hence they're banning encryption. Having 'encryption with a back-door' is in essence creating a new definition of encryption that doesn't adhere to the fundamental requirement of encryption. Then you have to consider: If the UK government has a back-door how can you ensure *only* the government has it? Simple answer: You can't. So now not only can the government read your messages - anyone with the key can read your messages, so now you're back to essentially 0 encryption.

Commission documentaries on crises in the NHS, make gloomy prophesies of imminent ""collapse"". Make sure at risk groups are underfunded. Heap on the targets while reducing funding. Make sure to blame the hospitals themselves, not the fact that they are struggling for resources and staff, being forced to improve while being strangled.

Then start to let it be known that there are other ways to ""improve"" the NHS. Keep strangling the funding and create staffing crises. But put it about that privatisation will make things better, whilst alway putting ""patients first"".

The bastards are killing the NHS deliberately and want to sell it to their cronies and American corporations. We are being stiffed. 

This will be Britain's shame, letting the pride of our nation trickle through our hands like so much sand into the hands of corporations.

The claim experience is divided into 3 parts. You initiate the claim online and then go for an initial assessment which is where you sign the ""job seeker's agreement"". This basically explains what you can expect from them and what you need to do to justify your money. This would be the time to mention you're limited for transport. Finally you return every 2 weeks to ""sign on"". This is where they review what you've done to find a job and, perhaps more importantly, agree you can have your money. It's worth bearing in mind that quite a lot of claimants will do little to find a job, so showing genuine willing will go down well. It's also less paperwork if they don't have to refuse your money. 

Two things:

1) When you initiate your claim, you'll also get access to the online Government job search system called Universal Job Match. Don't dismiss it entirely... It's not terrible. 

2) Use the online system to record your job search activity rather than the booklet. It makes the sign on process easier. 

Finally, if you do get a job don't forget to ""sign off"" and remember that you'll get JSA for all the time you're unemployed. So if you're offered a job on  Wednesday to start Monday, you'll get payment for the ""waiting period"".

For second place koscielny is competing against... Kompany? Sakho? Verthongen? koscileny isnt the second best because hes outstanding, its just as much because of the lack of world class competition. as much as i love sakho he is probably just behind koscielny

The best teams in england severely lack world class centerbacks. there are some good central defenders sure, but compared to other leagues there are suprisingly few top tier centrebacks playing in the premier league. none of the top teams in pl boast world class centreback pairings. United have a mix of rojo, phil jones and chris smalling. arguably the weakest trio of centerbacks among the top teams. Chelsea terry, cahill and zouma. Cahill is decent, terry is really good and zouma is really good for his age and may very well turn into one of the best in the league. Arsenal koscielny, mertesacker and gabriel. Manchester city ahve kompany, demichelis as well as mangala. their cb lineup is pretty good, but while demicheles is a solid veteran defender, hes in no way world class. Kompany was the best in the league a few years back but has taken some major steps backwards. Mangala has looked really bad so far honestly. His pricetag was absolutely ridicoulus and he hasnt performed close to good enough. so while he may improve in the future as of right now hes their third best cb. Tottenham have verthongen who can be pretty good, but has had his own kompany-esque fall from grace although a lot more discreet. then theres us, with sakho as IMO atleast a top 5 cb in the prem. Again, considering the competition. then Fonte at southampton, who played really well last year, but after multiple years of being the scapegoat/laughing stock of southamptons defence im reserving my judgement on him. he has  seemingly gone from a bad/mediocre defender (before the 2013/14 season) to a world class defender that many people rate among the best in the prem in under 2 seasons. Then theres everton with jagielka, who similarly to kompany and verthongen has had his own personal recession. They also however, have stones the biggest english talent at cb. May also become one of the best defenders in the league in the near future, but as of right now hes just pretty good.
