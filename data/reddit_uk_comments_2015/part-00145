null,false,ogbex,null,null,null,"Generally speaking it's the landlords responsibility to maintain appliances that come with the house, though this can be varied by your tenancy agreement. There may also be more specific rules regarding fire safety, though this is just a guess.

Your landlord sent the workman round to deal with the issue which seems like an acknowledgement of responsibility on his part. Can you deal directly with the landlord? It sounds as though things are getting lost in translation between you, the letting agency and your landlord. I would contact the landlord directly, via email is probably the best option as it allows you to lay down your case without losing your cool and also serves as a record of correspondence which could be important later on.

If you cannot sort the issue cordially then you have a decision to make.... You can either drop the matter, accept that it is a relatively small amount of money and move on or file a claim against the landlord. You can do this online ( money claim online) but you will have to pay a fee which you will only get back if you win, it is therefore essential that you are clear as to who's liability the fire alarms are so you need to read your tenancy agreement. 

Quite honestly, for the sake of £100 I don't think I'd launch a claim unless I was 100% certain of success because it can get quite costly. You also need to bear in mind that your landlord will likely have much greater means of representing himself in any legal action. 

Just as an afterthought, you're university may run a landlord accreditation scheme and you may be able to exert some pressure by complaining/ leaving bad reviews on the letting agency etc.

Not a good explanation, but I'm trying to explain it to you since you never saw the show. Basically, there are different sonic screwdrivers, they get lost, broken, fried, etc. on the show, but they run the same software, so it's really just the body that's different, but the same ""soul"", like the doctor. So a new sonic is really the same sonic, just looks new or different, or even looks the same but is new. If he hasn't seen the 50th yet, watch it with him and give him the new one and explain that just like the doctor's screwdriver, the new one you gave him will work the same. I'm guessing this is his first experience with death and that he's very young.

This even applies where the super injunction is hiding something that is clearly within the public interest to unveil, such as the rumoured superinjunction from Gerry Kelly hiding his alleged 'affair' with now former PSNI deputy chief Judith Gillespie. (But I haven't been issued with a super injunction, and wouldn't even be allowed to reveal it if I were, so I have no actual way of knowing if that superinjunction actually exists or not).

The only way for a superinjunction to come out risk free is if the person who took it out mentions it, or someone uses parliamentary privilege to reveal it.

Unions and Soclailst policy absolutiy destroyed our industrrail base in the UK.  Shipyards in Glasgow could not compete because Unions blocked the introduction of modern working due to the ""cost of Jobs""

They took Liverpool from being the biggest port in the world to a small North West back water.  This was because they blocked the introduction of containerised freight.  In the end a new port was built in Felixstowe.  Liverpool sees very little freight.

Unions also had a part to play in destroying the car industry in the UK.  Ok so we do build quite a number now, but these are all overseas companies.  Much of the engineering of these designs and of course the profits go over seas.

If there was a rise of a modern professional union that worked with businesses regognising that sometimes 1 person can do the job of three.  That if companines are allowed to invest in technology to grow and provide more taxes for the economy then I would be all for it.

null,false,bcash,null,null,null,"First of all, don't get debt and deficit confused.  Politicians are very precise with their use of the word, but are relying on people not knowing what it means.

Debt = amount of money we owe.

Deficit = amount by which the debt is getting larger.

So when Cameron says ""I've halved the deficit"", what he actually means is that the debt is getting bigger at half the rate it once was.  As a statistic this means nothing, borrowing is fine if it's spent wisely.

As other have said, economics as applied to countries is very different from economics as applied to households.  If I were to give the politicians the benefit of the doubt, I'd say they use these cumbersome analogies as most people are unfamiliar with macroeconomics; but on the other hand, it plays well to their need to pull the wool over people's eyes too!

The danger of a debt that gets too large is it means an ever larger proportion of tax revenue is spent on servicing the debt, paying interest on it.  The danger of a deficit that gets too large is that should the debt market change (we're competing with other countries for money essentially - the UK has a good reputation so we don't have to pay as much interest as most other countries - but should someone like USA/Germany start paying more, we may not be able to raise as much at low rates), then we'd have no choice but to borrow at higher interest rates.

Also, as others have said, there's a bit ""get-out-of-jail"" card in the fact we control our own currency.  Most, but not all!, of the debt is measured in Pounds Sterling, so we could just devalue the currency, that means we pay less.  This is not a happy ending though, for multiple reasons:

1.  It means everyone's savings/pension/salary is devalued as well, those cheap Chinese TV's will suddenly double in cost.  The purchase-power of your money gets worse.

2.  It damages the reputation of UK-issued debt, so next time we need to borrow, it'll either be at a higher interest rate; or in the form of Euro or Dollar denoted bonds instead.  (A percentage of the national debt takes this form currently anyway.)

So, all in all, it is good to ""balance the books"".  But balancing the books for an entire country means balanced over a twenty-year period, not each and every year.  Trouble is the current deficit has been going for nearly that length of time already, we forgot to reduce the debt during the mid-2000's ""good period"".",null,0,null,1429349749,null,0,false,0,cqgdjdh,null,t3_32yukv,null,t1_cqgdjdh,null,t3_32yukv,null,null,null,1432460351,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The going rate for a UK gilt at the moment is very cheap.

* Increase tax rates. This isn't a good idea in a recession, because it means people have less money to buy goods and services. Production drops further, and the recession goes on for longer. If anything it would be better to cut taxes. 

* Cut spending. Again this means that less goods and services are bought. Production drops, the recession goes on for longer, and the government takes in even less tax. 

* Borrow. This results in increased interest payments, but doesn't prolong the recession. If a country has its own currency, and if borrowing costs are low, this is the least-worst option. As the economy improves, production increases, the government takes in more tax without  needing to raise tax rates. This option will leave the country with *less* debt than the alternatives.

Unlike Goa, which was part of many Indian states prior to being ceded to the Portuguese in the 16th century, Argentina's formal claim to the Falklands is not derived from any historical settlement but inherited from Spain's signature to the Treaty of Tordesillas which ceded most of the New World to Spain and the African and Asian trade to Portugal. 

That's pretty flimsy, given that the treaty was always ignored entirely by Britain and France, who both originally and separately settled the Falklands/Malouines as well as most of North America and the Caribbean despite all of that territory being ""legally"" Spanish. It hasn't even been relevant to Spain and Portugal since perhaps the 18th century during disputes over the exact border between Spain's colony on the River Plate and Portuguese Brazil. Spain never incorporated the Falklands into it's Empire, so all Argentina inherits really is a claim authorised by a long-dead Pope, and if it's going to use the Tordesillas angle then it should really assert it's claims to the rest of the Americas ",null,0,null,1429354274,null,0,1429355274,0,cqgee91,null,t3_330ju4,null,t1_cqgee91,null,t1_cqge4hq,null,null,null,1432460755,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

Partly personal taste and marketing, partly what your needs are, an element of skin type. If you read the cleansers mega review thread and the beginners guide (both linked to in the sidebar) you will get a feel for who is using the products and how/ why.

**Oils and balms** are great for removing make up and sunscreens that contain silicone. They cam also be non stripping/ gentler on dry or sensitive skin types. Oils often contain emulsifiers (mix oil and water so they rinse clean, and tend to leave the skin feeling silky. Balms do not always have an emulsifier.

**Melting gels** work the same way as oils and balms, but they are more convenient and less messy than an oil so useful if you are travelling or staying at your partner's home regularly. The ingredients that make them a gel until they 'melt' onto your skin  are also emulsifiers, I think melting gels are slightly easier to remove than regular oils.

**Foaming products** tend to leave a more 'squeaky' clean feel which is too much for some skin types - my reactive skin has been much easier to manage since stopping using foamers four years ago. Some people following an Asian style routine follow an oil or a balm with a foaming or lotion product, this is known as 'double cleansing'.

Some foaming surfactants (the cleansing ingredients) are overly harsh, can even penetrate your skin and disrupt the barrier function. Some contain alkaline soaps with destroy the acid mantle/ beneficial flora (part of the skin barrier). 

**Lotions and creams** are also pretty gentle, but they may contain ingredients that clog certain skin types so are less commonly used by people with acne. The richer ones can remove waterproof or heavy make up, the lighter ones may not.

I never use **micellar waters** so someone else will have to tell you about those.",null,0,null,1429354394,null,0,false,0,cqgef59,null,t3_330l5n,null,t1_cqgef59,null,t3_330l5n,null,null,null,1432460766,null,7,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,7,null

2. If you don't earn over 21k (adjusted each year), you don't pay.

3. If you do, you don't pay loads back like a mortgage, you pay a small amount.

4. If you lose your job, you no longer have to pay. Same goes for if you quit your job to travel, or retire early.

5. If you haven't repaid in 30yrs, you no longer have to pay.

6. It doesn't affect your ability to get other loans/mortgages.

7. The interest rate is actually pretty low.

&gt; In our manifesto we set out why we still consider that nuclear is no answer to either climate change or our energy needs.
&gt; 
&gt; Nuclear energy is not green. Nuclear energy is neither zero carbon nor renewable and there is serious debate about whether it
&gt; is even low carbon. Uncertainties involved in carbon costing, radioactive waste management and the carbon costs of obtaining uranium mean that the carbon costs of nuclear are unknowable. Unlike renewables, we simply cannot rely on it being low carbon.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to its highly dubious ‘low-carbon’ credentials, nuclear energy is a seriously flawed policy in other ways:
&gt; 
&gt; * Nuclear energy is extremely expensive: not one nuclear plant has ever been built, anywhere in the world by private investors without huge public subsidies. The Coalition government has agreed to guarantee EDF nearly double the current market electricity price at Hinkley, in addition to other financial backing not available to other low-carbon generators. These subsidies would impose enormous and unjustifiable costs on householders and businesses.
&gt; 
&gt; * Nuclear remains a uniquely dangerous form of energy. If the new plant being built by EDF at Hinkley were to release an equivalent amount of radiation to Fukushima, and the wind was in the south-west, Bristol would need to be permanently evacuated.
&gt; 
&gt; * No long-term solution has yet been found to the question of dealing with nuclear waste.
&gt; 
&gt; * Wind power has been found to create around 12 times as many jobs as the same investment in nuclear, and solar power is estimated to create around 360 times as many jobs. Investing in energy efficiency (e.g. insulation) creates even more jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; * Renewables can provide the same ‘base load’ production as nuclear power at a lower cost without the risks. Nuclear power diverts investment, skills and expertise away from securing the economic, employment and energy security benefits of home-grown renewables, smart grids and demand reduction.
&gt; 
&gt; * The current UK nuclear programme is planned around a reactor design, the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR), which has an atrocious construction and cost record. EPRs being built in France and Finland are years behind schedule and have huge cost overruns. Even if nuclear were the answer, the EPR would still be the wrong plant to build.

The anti-nuclear stance is quite sensible from a safety perspective, especially when fairly catastrophic design flaws have been identified already in the design of nuclear power plants we're expecting to build.

And your comment on women in prisons is ignorant of the reasons the policy exists; especially since the policy document itself explains *why* it is there. It's not about simply sending less women to prison but trying to ensure rehabilitation, many women in prison have been victims of abuse, throwing them in a cell and tossing away the key isn't a solution for that.

EDIT: Basically, we have created some pretty awesome fucking shit. I am skeptical about my own list, as there are cases of much older versions of these elsewhere in the world. Namely for instance, sewage systems. But I think this list is more specific to a type. 

Additionally, we have:

- Scones
- History
- The English Language
- The SAS
- Stephen Hawking
- Christian Bale
- ~~Ricky Gervais~~ **David Attenborough**
- Churchill
- Shakespeare

We abolished slavery before many other countries. I'll add more later!

Would it be possible to see a return of the diamond to accommodate Gerrard? 13 goals against Villa, only God has scored more against them.  

Two fairly experienced players on the wings to handle the pace of Villa down the sides and the three big centre backs in there to hopefully deal with Benteke.  

The only thing would be if this line-up gives enough license for Henderson to move forward.

The SNP initially ruled out a deal with Labour, which Labour then ignored because, as they've said repeatedly, they're focussing on getting an overall majority. The begging and pre-emptive deal making the SNP hoped for didn't happen.

So in the latest debate, Miliband gave the snarling little anklebiting terrier a snack on the nose with the rolled up newspaper of ""No deal"".

He has, with that direct and unequivocal answer to Sturgeon, regained the uper hand in any post-election negotiations. Did anyone else notice how, following Miliband's rejection, Sturgeon continued by virtually begging?

Every other party except UKIP explicitly stated that they would not deal with the Tories to form the next Government. Their combined numbers, compared to the backing of the SNP isn't going to be enough to form a majority.

Unless something drastically different to expectations happens, we're going to have a Labour/SNP government, but the SNP needs to accept its' place as junior partner. Right now, they see themselves as the word in the ear of the crown. Miliband's got a couple of weeks left to bring them to order, which he's doing.

Gerrard brings both quality, experience and leadership and I'd like nothing better than for him to start. Due to Ibe being cup-tied I think it's a real possibility. The one con of having Gerrard play is that Henderson seems to be less effective and Rodgers often pushes him out to the left.

I also doubt Rodgers will drop Allen. 'Cause you know he's his 'son' and all that crap. Plus he's been quite good for us recently.

I think it's a very personal viewpoint so I apologise if it is not coming across clearly.

null,false,Number6UK,null,null,null,"Last year I was travelling to London and was sharing a table seat with several strangers and I'd been sitting there quietly with headphones on.

At some point  somewhere after Birmingham, my phone rang (my dad calling to see if I'd made the train) and when I answered it I couldn't help notice the lack of subtlety as no less than 4 nearby people glanced over, frowned and shifted their bags closer towards themselves.

I thought that was quite disgusting.

I think that's the worst that's happened in the last few years. It's certainly the one that's freshest in my mind anyway. That said, you do get the constant ""jokes"" though about thieving, benefit scrounging, etc., and then when you don't laugh you're accused of having no sense of humour and being a ""typical scouser"".

They don't seem to understand that it's just not funny when you've been hearing the same joke repeated for your entire life every time you venture outside the area you grew up in.

It's worth mentioning the flip-side too though - I've had nice conversations with people in other cities/countries because they heard my accent, although they often start with a variant of ""I know Liverpool has a bad reputation but…"" so the stereotype is widespread and ingrained.

People *always*, *always* assume you love football too, which I don't. They cannot fathom that I might not know or care about which division a club is in, or who plays for them, or well, anything. That gets annoying.

The environmental impact of manufacturing hybrid and electric car batteries is completely overblown, and Top Gear's disinformation campaign really didn't help matters.  Electric cars are, in fact, better for the environment than normal cars.  

The Norwegian study was gravely flawed, because they made some extremely critical errors in their input assumptions, such as [assuming a 1,000 kg motor for the Nissan Leaf, when it in fact has a 53 kg motor](http://llewblog.squarespace.com/electric-cars/2012/10/11/the-truth-will-out.html), and [using battery manufacturing carbon debt values 3.6 times higher than in other recent studies](http://priuschat.com/threads/plug-in-prius-most-environmentally-friendly-vehicle-in-study.130487/page-4).

The PNAS paper was massively misleading as well, because they only focused on O3 and PM2.5, to the exclusion of all other pollutants (which, as per the UCLA, [are dwarfed in magnitude by carbon dioxide](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf)).  Taking into account other emissions reverses their conclusion decisively.

Zehner's work, meanwhile, is a complete joke, because he starts off by broad-brushing any article with pro-electric car conclusions as untrustworthy by definition, with the mere insinuation of such works being paid for by corporate interests.  It's hard to take his work seriously when his opening move is to categorically discount any evidence that contradicts his argument as biased by definition.  

He also seems to go far out his way to rob the reader of context to exaggerate the flaws of electric cars (e.g. focusing on a single type of emissions, SF6, without giving specific numbers on its overall weight relative to other emissions (placing it into context, SF6 [only accounts for 0.2% of the overall greenhouse gas problem](http://www.cleanenergyauthority.com/solar-energy-news/green-illusions-distorts-solar-on-environment-060712)), bringing up manufacturing pollution without accompanying it with its relative proportion to the car's lifecycle pollution, bringing up energy pollution in China as an indictment of electric cars in North America and Europe).",null,0,null,1429363511,null,0,1429368448,0,cqggq9c,null,t3_32wzun,null,t1_cqggq9c,null,t1_cqfqj3w,null,null,null,1432461923,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Flabby-Nonsense,null,null,null,"In my opinion the right to self-determination trumps the argument from proximity. If the people of the Falkland Islands voted to become Argentinian i'm sure most people, including myself, would be more than happy to let them.

However, as /u/spiz has said, there was a referendum and 99.8% voted to stay British.

Now the Argentine government would dispute this referendum by pointing out that the islanders are not native and are the descendants of British colonists and so their opinion doesn't matter. 

Obviously ignoring the fact that all Argentines, including their president, are descended from Spanish colonists and that they, after declaring independence from Spain in 1853  [declared war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Desert) on the native inhabitants of Patagonia, killing many indians and displacing many more from their own land.

Furthermore the Falkland Islands were first claimed by the British in 1765 by John Byron who named them. The Falklands were owned for a time by the Spanish, British and French, the Falklands came under full British rule in 1816, 40 years before Argentina became independent from Spain. So they have no right to claim, as they do, that the British invaded the Falkland Islands and took them by force. There was no native population on the islands and the British did not take the islands from Spain or France by force.

The Argentine leader also frequently states that her people have always been a victim of colonialists, whether it be the Spanish or the British. Conveniently forgetting that almost all Argentines are Spanish descendants and speak Spanish. That would be like the USA claiming white people ruined their country.

**Price of product:** $25 for 30ml

**Where did you purchase:** [Lucy Minerals](http://www.lucyminerals.com/)

**Product claims:** *""This Serum contains a gentle stable form of Vitamin  C called Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate. It also contains Hyaluronic Acid which is a powerful moisture-binding ingredient.*

*This Serum can be applied once or twice a day after cleansing.  Shake gently.  Apply a thin layer of Vitamin C Serum,  allow to dry,  and then follow with a few drops of Ambrosia Beauty Oil or Moisturizer.*

*Note from Annie ~ The Ingredients highlighted in red are linked to some articles about these ingredients.  So far, everyone who has tested our new Lucy Essentials Vitamin C Serum has loved it.  It dries to non-sticky finish and feels light and clean underneath our Mineral Foundation.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. It feels smoother and more refined. Old acne marks have lightened and if I get a blemish they heal quickly.  It is gentle enough to use around the eyes.""*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.

**Your opinion:** The serum is housed in a cobalt blue glass bottle with dropper. It has liquidy consistency and opaque very pale yellow color and strong smell from what I assume to be the roman chamomile EO. I used almost the whole dropper for my whole face, neck and décolletage. I dropped the serum on my skin, spread it around and pat.

When just applied it feels a tiny tad sticky, but sinks in immediately with no residue. I don't feel it's hydrating on its own as it dries to nothing. It does leave my skin looking a bit shinier than usual, but nothing of real concern.

First few applications, I felt a bit of a sting. But mostly, I feel a slight warm sensation on my skin for a few minutes after application.

When I started it, I just recovered from 2 cysts from 2 products that did not agree with my skin. I was expecting some lightening with using this serum, but I didn't see any. After 10-days testing this serum, I added Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating serum and then reincorporated oil cleansing with sunflower oil 8-days after (I was rebuilding my routine after a bad SD-flareups last January).

Around 2-weeks in, I started noticing my forehead looks clogged in tiny bumpy texture. I also got milia-looking bumps on nasolabial fold on the right side of my face. Plus, my face looks somewhat dull. Most of my products reintroduced to my new routine were in my previous one, so I was pretty confident it can't be from them. The new ones are only this serum and the Superdrug one. But I was also using a new conditioner, so I suspected it must be it, or the Superdrug serum.

Now, I recently went to the Netherlands for a week. It was full of dinners and late night drinks, so my skincare routine went down the drain. I skipped my night routine almost every night, but I stuck with my morning ones. I usually use Skinoren at night, mixed with Retin-A, but due to my laziness, and the clogs, I moved the Skinoren in the morning as well, after this serum and before Superdrug.

I ran out of my conditioner while I was there, but my clogs persisted. Usually, when I use a clogging product, the clogs go aways in a day or two after stopping usage. Since I wanted the Skinoren to take full effect, I dropped the Lucy serum but keep using the Superdrug. Lo and behold, my clogs disappeared in just a day! And the glow returned, too! I'm so glad it's not the Superdrug serum. I'd guess my skin doesn't agree with either the Roman Chamomile EO and/or the jojoba oil. 

Needless to say, I dropped this serum completely from my routine and keep using Skinoren in the morning. I will try other C serums (planning to get Active Formulas LAA and Antioxidant serums), but I'll stick to my current routine for a bit more.

The warcry of ""We want more powers to build"" is nonsense. Planning law has been eviscerated which is fucking moronic but another discussion entirely. The issue now is NIMBY groups deciding they don't want a new block going up in *their* area. I've seen this first hand in Kensington and Knightsbridge. Some old biddy rallies the community against a nice new development which will offer lots of new homes (30 -&gt; 85 on the same plot of land) which is sympathetically designed. In the end it all fell through and nothing was built on the land and still hasn't been 4 years later. The reasoning was that some balconies would overlook some properties, ignoring the fact that they already all overlook each other because they're back-to-back (with a mews in the middle) terraced town houses... It beggars belief.

Either we back localism or we allow new developments to trump local opinion. The two are *not* compatible as it stands.

As the currency falls people go short and the collapse can be quick and devastating. Many times in history this has happened.

What this means for the ordinary man in the street is a breakdown in law and order, services disappear overnight, fuel and food become very expensive and so forth. Here is how someone who survived the Argentinian economic collapse described the situation.

'After all these years I learned that even though the person that lives out in the country is safer when it comes to small time robberies, that same person is more exposed to extremely violent home robberies. Criminals know that they are isolated and their feeling of invulnerability is boosted. When they assault a country home or farm, they will usually stay there for hours or days torturing the owners. I heard it all: women and children getting raped, people tied to the beds and tortured with electricity, beatings, burned with acetylene torches'

It's time to come down on the employers. However, I think the UK should consider reducing the tax overhead on firms by lowering the corporation tax rate to a more competitive rate on par with Ireland. 

Our tax system needs a complete and total overhaul. Its a mess of loads of different taxes and benefits that often do the same thing; We should look at consolidating a lot of the system. Close the loopholes by eliminating the tax benefits that opened the loophole in the first place.

My understanding is that they pretty much agreed it's ok to record the DNA of anyone who's arrested on suspicion of a crime, and to hold it on file for some time. The important part of their ruling was that the government isn't allowed to hold *indefinitely* the DNA profiles of innocent people (or, I think, those convicted only of petty offences) and must destroy them after, I think, 10 years.

Following the ruling, however, the UK government dragged their feet about implementing any changes, and I'm not sure if any progress has been made yet.

They are at odds, if you take a liberal drug policy, then you can cut the police budget as they no longer have to deal with the crime of it, you can tax the drugs so have more money (just like the conservatives did with VAT on all purchases) to spend, then of course the whole treatment of the drug issue which already exists becomes a problem for the fiscal conservative as they don't want to have government functions that help people, they believe you should help yourself, doesn't really work in this case. But the facts are the current drug policy is wasting a load of money on police resources, it is reducing tax revenues, funding criminal organisation, demonising and criminalising the actions of many working, functioning, voting, tax paying individuals, all while drugs are essentially readily available for anyone who want them, but in a more dangerous manner without any information about the effects and long term use of them.

Of course you get better doctors and nurses if you pay them more. 

My experience with everything about the NHS has been absolutely awful whilst its the complete opposite when I lived in America and Australia. Yet Brits have this insane idea in their head that the NHS is somehow better. It's patently not.

Its great if you're poor as it means you'll always be looked after and I agree with that.

I just cannot understand why we can't introduce a payment system means tested so that we could fund it properly. Everyone always bangs on about the NHS getting funded properly but no one ever wants to pay for it.

 A couple of years ago, i was in a bad place. Unemployed, obese, depressed and very anxious. My family has a history of cardiological issues so this added to my anxiety. On my 23rd birthday no less, i have a massive panic attack. I completely freak out and genuinely believe that i'm having some kind of heart attack. We call 999, and a local first responder is with me in under 4 minutes. Following this, a regular ambulance arrives with an ECG machine and checks me out.

I'm fine, nothing to be worried about (apart from my clearly obvious anxiety isues). Still, being in the highly anxious state that i was,  i needed to go to hospital to feel absolutely certain that i was fine.  I know, at least 3 medical professionals had told me i was medically fine as far as they could tell (and they were brilliant too, extremely calm and reassuring) but i still took the trip to hospital. 

Now, had i been in a country where a visit to hospital would cost me hundreds if not thousands, then i probably wouldn't have gone. I wouldn't have peace of mind and more importantly, there could've been something wrong with me not noticeable from a basic ECG. But thanks to the NHS, i went that night.

 I had a more advanced ECG with blood taken too and i was fine. I was home by 3am, without a bill to boot either. 

I'm rambling now i realise, but it was the paramedics that really stood out that night. They were just the best people you could hope to be with you when you're extremely agitated and convinced that you could be dying. 

So yeah, the NHS.

* Accents. Maybe I just don't have my ear in properly, but I miss the depth and nuances of communication conveyed by regional accents. It's pretty boring when everyone sounds the same.
* Underground utility cables. When I first moved over here the birds-nest of cables on telegraph poles above your head was a big surprise. After a few years I barely notice them, but they're still bloody ugly and go everywhere.
* The ability to be self-deprecating. People just look at you like you're an idiot, and wonder why you're telling these stories about your own shortcomings.
* Variable weather. Yeah, ok, the UK gets a lot of rain, but you also get sun, wind, snow, etc. Over here we get seasons, but the weather is pretty much the same from day to day, from freeze-your-balls-off cold in the winter to scorching bastard heat in the summer. We have had snow on the ground since January 4th. It's still about 2ft deep, and it's pretty depressing.
* Things being close together. I live in a town of about 350 000. The nearest bigger place is 10 hours away. The low population density means there's not much going on in the ""countryside"" so the idea of stopping for a pint or finding a nice cafe is a complete fiction. I have a 28 hour round trip to my nearest IKEA.

I can understand that your personal experiences taint your idea of what the NHS is and is not, but when an independent organisation (based in the US no less) studies the system and finds it the best in the world, do you not think maybe you were just unlucky in the NHS and lucky in the US?  There are plenty of horror stories from the US about the quality of care, just as in the NHS and AUS systems.

&gt; I just cannot understand why we can't introduce a payment system means tested so that we could fund it properly. Everyone always bangs on about the NHS getting funded properly but no one ever wants to pay for it.

We do have a means tested payment system.  Different people pay different amounts, it's just that in the NHS the means testing is done through taxation, whereas in the US it's done at the point of insurance purchase/treatment.  Plus, only a vocal minority ever complain about raises in national insurance - most people are happy to pay for the great services it brings.

The thing is there is a lot of room for fudging things around in those types of reports and I don't believe it was done without bias. They had an agenda they wanted to push and they pushed it. The report got signifficantly more exposure over here than it did in the US where it was rightly laughed off. It played towards Brits idea that the NHS is the best in the world here so it of course got reported everywhere.

None of the papers other than the FT even bothered to check anything about the group that wrote it.

The route that I'm taking is that I'm making significant contributions to my pension when it'll make a difference to the tax bracket that I'm in, for example if I was earning £120k this year I would make total contributions of at least £20k into my pension.  The tax rate from £100K to £120K is effectively 60% which is high so by making large payments you might be able to avoid that altogether.  If I wasn't able to lower my tax bracket like this I'd probably pay money into ISAs, until such time as the limit there is met, I believe pensions work out better under todays rules but there are two factors here, ISAs are accessible today and as you say you don't know what the pension rules will be in twenty years time.

His broadest stroke is to change the governance of British cities, devolving the power to raise taxes and borrow money but imposing strong national standards on energy efficiency.
Stern would introduce a platform for congestion charging to enable cities to develop areas connected by public transport and walking/cycling routes. He’d also raise the price of emitting carbon via a direct tax or an emissions trading system. 

Almost exactly Green Party policy.

&gt;Haskel’s research finds that government funding of science is the perfect complement to private, practically minded research funding.

Green Party want to double state spending on scientific research.

&gt;Wren-Lewis’s response: in future, the Bank of England should print the money and hand it to the government on condition it be used for a fiscal expansion.

This is similar to Green Party proposal of sovereign money creation.

&gt;The most eye-catching suggestion is that companies should publish the ratio between what the chief executive is paid and what the median worker in the company is paid.

They have local offices all over the country and can offer advice over the phone or in person.

&gt;It has been asserted that ""Between the re-establishment of British rule on the Falkland Islands in 1833 and the ratification of the treaty, Argentina sent annual protests to the British government by means of the Message to Congress,[citation needed] thereby maintaining Argentina's claim to the islands[citation needed]"". Following the treaty, such protests ceased,[citation needed] and Argentina did not protest again diplomatically until 1888.[citation needed] The matter was not raised again before the Argentine Congress until 1941. The British government cites this change as evidence that ""there is no question over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands"".[11]

I'm a decent landlord - I hope.  Really, I care about two things:

1. Are you going to pay your rent on time?
2. Are you going to to cost me more money than I make from you? (That is, are you going to trash the place?)

There's really no need to tell a letting agent or the landlord if you have a disability - unless you think you need some adjustments to the place or you want a guide dog / assistance animal.  From your other comments, it doesn't sound like you need a ramp / accessible loo / etc.

I guess, really, it comes down to whether you can pay.  Do you have a stable job or evidence of regular income?  That's the primary thing agents and landlords care about.

The Canadian constitution is a mixture of codified laws and acts of Parliament, along with unwritten traditions and conventions, it's not dissimilar to what we have.  

Saying that Canada has a written constitution and we don't is far more a matter of semantics than it is any sort of reflection of reality.  There's no single written document and their Constitution Acts include provisions to refer to British conventions.

While tuition fees are high you still get an interest-free loan to cover it and only have to pay it back on exceptionally generous terms (£50 a month on a £25k wage, for example). 

The economy isn't really bad. In first world terms we're actually doing pretty well after the recession. All those students you see on TV bitching about not finding any work are always students who took degrees that have niche, limited or oversubscribed employment opportunities at the other side.

Robust democracy that is largely free from corruption and largely attempts to see the people doing well as opposed to shafting them for vested interests.

An education in the UK is well thought of worldwide and the UK is home to many global companies. Employment opportunities are great and varied, with plenty of choice between jobs that keep you in the nest and jobs that'll see you across the globe.

Climate is agreeable. Warm but not scorching in the summer, cold but not deathly in the winter.

UK passports are pretty well regarded worldwide, you can travel quite freely and easily if you carry one.

There was absolutely no talking to him about it. He lost all reason, and became rabid and insensible. I believe that propagandisation on this subject to which most Argentinians are subject to, from a very early age, is almost unassailable. And this guy was highly educated - imagine the majority of people, with minimal education and intellectual curiosity.

I should point out that it could be argued that we Brits could be propagandised too. Around the time of the 1982 war, I personally didn't trust the government line, and didn't know what I believed about the issue. So I spent quite a little time reading the islands' tortuous history.

Why would Scottish independence be bad for England? My wife is English, she understands the issues, and she's in favour of Scottish independence. I think Nicola Sturgeon could have an enormously positive impact on Westminster politics. Have you ever considered that maybe their enormous popularity with Scottish people is because they've shown themselves to be very good at running Scotland and they're not a bunch of duplicitous cunts like the 3 establishment parties? Sorry to put it in such brash terms but its true.

Just remember that you get your news from people with a vested interest in maintaining the establishment (billionaires like Rupert Murdoch, [Viscount Jonathan Harmsworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Harmsworth,_4th_Viscount_Rothermere) and the Barclay brothers etc.) and maybe there's more to the issues than they've led you to believe.

**I wish England had a party like the SNP**.
As it is, you'll just have to make do with borrowing ours for a while. I hope it brings a positive change to Westminster and all.

10 years ago I was strongly against ""That salmond"" and the rest of the SNP, mainly because I always believed what I was *told* they said, rather than listening to what they *actually* said.

I wonder what proportion of English voters want something done to fix Westminster. Independence is partly a reaction to the failure/unwillingness of Westminster to reform.

The differing motor weights don't provide comparative figures so we cannot know how accurate or inaccurate they are.

The carbon debt values are based on the life of the battery in the electric vehicle which again seems a perfectly reasonable assumption. 

Microemissions are an increasing problem due to the government (and consequently motor industries) fixation on CO2 at the expense of microemissions. I remain open-minded as to how taking into account total emissions affects findings but I've yet to see any evidence of this.

You and the sources you've cited are guilty of the exact same criticism you put towards Zehner regarding scepticism.

null,false,square13,null,null,null,"A lot of my family come from pretty impoverished parts of Fife and I was amazed that this kind of poverty and mentality exists in a country so wealthy and that has contributed so much to the world.

I watched this documentary, it was interesting but like many documentaries on poverty in this country it seems quite narrow. I'm not someone who believes that people are fully responsible for their own set of circumstances, the government and society etc have a large part, but I do think that often there is a poisonous mentality that exists. It seems that entire generations of families in certain areas believe that the whole world is against them and they will never escape from this poverty, which has probably been reinforced by the horrendous conditions these people have found themselves in for extended periods of time.

This documentary shows us what is happening but not why. It would be interesting to delve into the pasts of some of these individuals and find out how and why they have fallen into their situation. It seems many have the mindset of ""I can't get a job because no one will employ me/I don't have the experience"". 

Well then why are these people struggling to get employed? Do they have some kind of sickness or illness that precludes them from work? Were you somehow unprepared for life from the beginning? Are you unable to communicate properly with people? How are entire swathes of the country failing to enter the workforce, and how can we help them get into the workforce and stop this from happening. 

Do people need better lessons in managing money perhaps as well? I noticed one guy was living in the dark and using a torch to navigate around, I don't know if his electricity had been turned off or not but I presume not because he was showing us the inside of his fridge which must have been turned on? However I often hear about people living in darkness to try and save on electricity bills, the reality is that it costs about 2p to power a lightbulb from the grid for 15 hours, the costs of batteries and torches would far exceed probably by an order of magnitude of at least 100 times. If he genuinely feels he has to do this then we need to show him not only that he doesn't have to live like this, but he shouldn't because it's probably more expensive!

If people struggle with addiction to drugs/alcohol/cigarettes then we should be helping them to overcome their addictions. I did think it was a bit rich for the guy at the start to talk about coming here because he can't afford to eat as he is rolling a cigarette, sure maybe his tobacco isn't expensive or maybe he doesn't smoke much but it kind of reveals a really unhealthy mentality which has probably been brought about because of the dire situation they are in. Some people seem to be smoking branded, packaged cigarettes which cost what £8-9 in the shops? Surely we could at least encourage them to switch to rolling tobacco? 

If people struggle with debts we perhaps need a central government fund which will help to relieve debt on those in the most dire situations. If it is legitimate debt that has been outstanding for years, if it is unlikely to ever be repaid the creditors will probably accept something like 20-30p on the pound and write off the rest. Or assist people with filing for bankruptcy.

Having him there, he's not going to move up in attack really, he's just there to deal with Fellaini. But you have to assume that when in possession, Fabregas will drop deep as he always does when he's in the advanced position to get on the ball, and Oscar will move from the wing more into a central No. 10 role, and then Ivanovic will take up a position as the right winger. Normally Ivanovic gets out of position and struggles to defend when he pushes up so far, but having Zouma cover for him, who has the pace and the strength, and who won't ever really move up from his position, will compensate for that. I think we'll be able to dominate possession in this game.

The idea that a single, codified constitution can cover everything, accurately and without ambiguity, is naive.

EDIT: To further elaborate on the difficulties of constitutional matters, let's look at the right to privacy. First you have to define privacy and what its limits might be. Then you have to factor in changes such as the creation of the World Wide Web. The founding fathers of the U.S. couldn't have foreseen that when writing their constitution. So flexibility is necessary.

And constitutions themselves don't guarantee that you'll get all the things you like. The U.S. Constitution didn't liberate black people from slavery, and in fact valued black slaves as being worth three fifths that of a free white man.

The U.S. Constitution did not enfranchise women with the vote.

Made even more of a farce by the fact that this should be known in the first place, let alone after the Mirallas incident earlier in the season. But, whatever.

I thought the second yellow was harsh. Usually, there, you'd get a stern word and told this is your last chance, if you hadn't been booked already, that would have been a yellow. Don't think it affected the outcome of the match in the end though.

I can't remember why but I like Kone. It's hard to argue that he's going to be good enough for Everton though. Perhaps if he gets a full pre-season under his belt he'll have a stronger season but I'm not convinced. I'd say we definitely need a better second choice striker behind Rom.

I think the political system is broken. We need to reform Westminster. The system is crumbling as quickly as the actual Palace... 

It's 2015, and we still don't have a form of proportional representation. Until a few weeks ago, there were 26 male clergy from a foreign church helping to decide which laws affect me - we've progressed massively now, having 25 men and 1 woman as the Lords Spiritual. The House of Lords doesn't even pretend to be representative, and the House of Commons in some ways is getting worse. There are no voices of the young, not enough of women, not enough from different backgrounds. How many within Government went to private school and/or OxBridge compared to the general population? How many of the Cabinet are millionaires? Our representative democracy only works if they actually represent us as a society.  And we can't hope to make other sectors equal until we sort out our government first. 

Where I live I have 4 layers of government. With 4 electoral systems and either 3 or 4 different franchises (I'd have to check.. it's fluid right now..). That's not how you engage the younger members of society, or anyone else for that matter. Like everything else to do with the UK political systems, it's all just a fudge and a compromise, and we are afraid of taking a step back to look at the system and think, hold on, can we do this another way?

I don't know this mans situation, but it's pretty common for benefits claimants living in social housing to have PAYG energy meters, where you have to top up a card in a shop like a phone. If the money on your card runs out, the supply gets shut off until you top it up again.

This is often very expensive, as tenants often don't have a choice to switch tariffs and don't receive perks like discounts for paying via direct debit etc. The guy in the video, if he's in that situation, was probably just wanting to make his money go further, even if the changes he's making are minimal at best.

There are 3 teams above us. We need two to drop points. Watford &amp; Bournemouth would need to lose; a draw from Middlesborough would be enough.

**Watford:** Lost 25%. Probability to lose at least one game: 44%

**Bournemouth:** Lost 18%. Probability: 33%

**Middlesbrough:** Failed to win 43%. Probability: 68%.

Probability that two of these teams drop enough points for us to overtake: **67%!**

This obviously doesn't take into account the quality of the opposition or the added 'squeeky bum time' motivation. And this is still dependant on Norwich winning both games. But if we can, there's definitely still a chance!

&gt; when filtering in slow-moving traffic, take care and keep your speed low. 

So no, there's no strict speed restriction (apart from the speed limit of the road, naturally), but if you're going too fast and cause an accident it could be given a dim view by the police.

Regarding bus lanes, you're not supposed to cross the solid white line to enter or exit (although buses and taxis do this all the time of course), and if the lane doesn't allow motorcycles, filtering between it and the carriageway is probably not legal. Same with cycle lanes. Unlikely you'd be pulled up on it though, unless you knocked into a cyclist of course.

But the thing about straddling a bus lane is, there's buses in it. They can be impossible to pass, they may mean pedestrians where you don't expect them.

If you buy a car and it is owned by someone else you will *lose* it with *no recourse*. The law WILL hurt you - so DO YOUR CHECKS. It may cost you £10 to check a car - but it is better than losing £1,000.

Always test drive the car. If it is a dodgy looking young male who wants to meet you on a street corner - walk away. Better to turn up to somebody's home that matches what is printed on the V5C. Don't buy a car without seeing the V5C first. Don't buy a car on the day you see it.

Oh - and you're not going to get a 1K car from a dealer. Look on autotrader online.",null,0,null,1429377752,null,0,false,0,cqgn15b,null,t3_330wwr,null,t1_cqgn15b,null,t3_330wwr,null,null,null,1432464892,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

2. In theory this is nice, though you are accumulating interest in the process.

3. See 2.

4. This is a positive, though getting your job back will mean repaying all the accumulated interest (this matters more when RPI is unrepresentative of actual wage inflation, like in 2007/8).

5. This is a positive, though 30 years is a very long time to have your wages garnished.

6. This is not entirely true, as for mortgages it counts as an outgoing and if you're a bit financially stretched, may be what puts you over the edge. I had to declare my student loan interest payments on my mortgage application.

7. No, it isn't - 5.5% is 3 percentage points higher than my mortgage and 2 percentage points higher than personal loans. It is not a market-leading interest rate by any stretch of the imagination. It will go up, too, since it's RPI based - I remember the 2007 RPI for student loan purposes was 4.8%, I'm sure it's been even higher in the past. The fact that people are paying so little off each month also works against people - so that personal loan with 3.6% interest is supposed to be paid off in full after what, five years? If you're still struggling on after 20, 25 years, the interest accumulated will be huge.

8. This is a positive.

I think the goodwill caused by the favourable loan terms for pre-2012 loans causes people to look far too kindly upon post-2012 loans. Yeah, okay, only 50% of people are going to pay off in full, but plenty of the people who don't pay off in full will have paid maybe 80, 90% of a loan plus interest for 30 years.",null,0,null,1429378703,null,0,1429379129,0,cqgniov,null,t3_32vel1,null,t1_cqgniov,null,t1_cqgekiq,null,null,null,1432465121,null,0,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,0,null

The SNP will make Ed Prime Minister no questions asked, even if it's only by not supporting David Cameron for PM.


But if Labour need the SNP to make up the numbers in the commons then they will **need** SNP votes to pass any legislation the Tories vote against, that means if they want to pass anything of value from their manifesto they're going to have to appease the SNP and the SNP would only be too happy to vote down some Labour legislation they think is Tory-lite as it would be great PR.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"Lets see, many, many thing are broken some in a small manner, some which are hard to fix and some are fine.

Firstly the NHS, it is currently underfunded, this is fact especially in A&amp;E they have been cutting back and ""centralising"" services for years, many are reaching the highest alert levels due to lack of doctors in relatively mundane situations, the recent pollution and hot weather for instance. The solution, more funding, people aren't even against tax rises for NHS spending.

Transport infrastructure, many train lines in the south east are at capacity and have 0 redundancy, this means if anything goes wrong everything on that line gets delayed, the solution is more infrastructure, but where to put it and what to build is a question I don't have the answer too.  

Austerity, who even thinks this is actually a good idea? It makes sense to an extent, but as the SNP made the point of in the debate, why do we have to pay off so much of the deficient in the next 5 years, the UK has been around for hundreds of years, why are politicians just obsessed with the next 5 years, maybe if they actually had a long term plan for the UK rather than short term ideas because they might get voted out then they might have better solutions for the UK. Why can't we pay off the deficit slower over the next 10-15 years, the only reason seems to be because politicians have 5 year terms, that isn't a real reason.

Drug policy, mainly caused by the authoritarian right wing parties, even worse with a fiscally conservative one as the drug policy is at odds with it. What the current drug policy achieves is increasing the demands of the police, which means they need more funding, increasing tax rates. Then the actual drugs, they aren't taxed, they aren't regulated, they fund criminals, who cause further crime in lower income neighbourhoods, they also provide a incentive for crime, if you can make more money selling drugs than you can in another job, why wouldn't you, that is the Tory entrepreneurial spirit right there, the irony. All while you have criminalised a lot of working, tax paying, voting individuals. 

Then you have the irrational ""but drugs are bad"" argument, firstly research shows there really is no relationship between ""badness"" and drug class, secondly, they are freely available to all anyway, in an unregulated manner, no one has stopped anyone from getting anything...the restriction doesn't work.

So how do you change it? You legalise the drug usage, people are using them anyway, so what difference does it make? No one is going to take up heroin for a laugh, just like 100% of the population doesn't smoke, a perfectly legal and available activity, that is far more dangerous than some illegal drugs all while being addictive. Even so, just because you base drug laws on rational evidence doesn't mean you have to legalise all of them, addictive drugs aren't good, carcinogenic drugs aren't good, age limits should be enforced, but as you will see from this statement cigarettes fit all the prerequisites of the worst type of drugs, yet are legal. What making the illegal ones that are better for you and smoking achieves is you can now have anti-drug campaigns, with the real risks, with the real effects, inform people and let them make a decision, most will come out doing exactly the same they do now, especially if you put barriers to entry in place, such as medical from a doctor to check that it is actually safe for you to take them. 

If you make a lot of other drugs legal, to be sold in a regulated manner (so amateur drug dealing is still illegal), like alcohol and cigarettes and then restrict the locations of their use, just like smoking, then you have a system that doesn't support them, but doesn't restrict them, and what business is it what you do in your own home, if it doesn't hurt others.But at the same time, drunk and disorderly is a crime, it would be no different for drugs, if you can act like a civilised human being why shouldn't you be allowed to go around your day, and just like alcohol, if you are noticeably drunk at work, that isn't acceptable. I don't even take any of these drugs, I just believe that I would rather the people who did could do it in a safe manner, on a regulated dose, with the money going to the government and regulated businesses contributing the the UK economy, rather than amateur crime causing drug dealers who do serious damage to low income communities through gang violence. 

What other problems are there, tax evasion, especially big business tax evasion, and even more so companies like Starbucks who have to be here to sell their product, if a company can just move abroad and are only here due to the low tax rates, that is one thing, if they are a retailer selling to the UK population and have to be active in the UK to do so, that is another thing. 

Housing and rent, this is a serious issue especially in the South East, there isn't enough housing for the populous, the right to buy is a problem, it is sucking up the social housing pool, and why should people in social housing have the right to buy, when your average person can no longer afford to buy, people who work harder with better jobs, should be mildly better off, this situation does not make that so, and also is of detriment to the poorer generations in the future. Rent needs to stop being an income and a business for people and go back to being a reasonable way to have a stable life, taxation should increase on each property you own, so if you have 1-2 properties that is fine, if you have 100, after the first 10 they are no longer profitable. Houses should be places to live and an income supplement for the better off, not profit gouging business. 

The rent and housing problem is also exacerbated by over reliance in London, the UK needs diversification, a lot of northern cities have been disregarded, there is no reason to live there as there are no jobs, places like Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool all have successes, and should be take as models of what a lot of northern cities should become, then the people working in these cities no longer need to rent in London as they don't have a job there, Germany is a far better model for this.

Then you have the economy, the UK should be investing in high skilled industries for the high skilled graduates it has, this includes banking and finance, just like was done in the 90's, as well as science, engineering and technology, much like Japan does. Investments by the government, which of course include spending money (not austerity), brings back massive returns to your country in the long term, in both business, intellectual property, and high skilled industries. There is no money in making clothing or coal mining, the money is in design, research and development, and if the UK doesn't invest in them the it will fall, China is coming, India is coming, Eastern Europe is coming, they can all manufacture cheaper than us, in the future they will produce quality graduates with all the design skills need, if our graduates and companies aren't a step above their offering we will be replaced by the cheaper option, just like coding is being outsourced right now.

The you have the UK itself, its culture, its history, its people, these need to be protected and not destroyed, why, because of tourism, the English countryside is world renowned through literature and through history. The traditions and history, like the Queen, the churches, the castles, the stately homes, should be protected, because they make this country money through tourism, we have thousands of years of history and the countryside to put it in, it should be protected and this can work synergistically with the environmental legislation.

null,false,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,null,"**House prices:**

* A return to pre-1998 prices and a reduction in private rents will make saving for a deposit much easier

* The price of a new home should be capped at a certain percentage over and above its *actual* value to allow some profitability.  The actual value should be determined by: the price of the land; the cost of construction materials and labour; and the cost of the admin and planning permission to get it there in the first place.  No more charging £400k for something which was dreamt up and built for less than half that

* Reform council tax as the bands haven't been revised since 1991, and house prices have gone haywire meantime.  Why should a Saudi billionaire pay the same council tax on his £50m mega mansion (that he’s literally never even been to) as a £300k hospital consultant in his £2m Wimbledon end-terrace that was bought much more cheaply in 1986 and has risen in value all by itself?

* Mansion tax is a decent idea, but the threshold is too low, and will catch out people of modest means who bought their house a billion years ago for a more reasonable sum.  Increase it to maybe £3m or above

* Tax gathered from private rental income and mansion tax should be spent on social and council housing projects, or subsidies for private developers to build more homes

* End hare-brained schemes to force people onto the property ladder when they can’t afford it, let prices come down on their own and stop propping them up.  Also end “right to buy” - why should one person receive a discount on taking a council house out of circulation and thus reducing supply, when another person on a higher income can’t afford to get out of the private rental trap?

* Stop using runaway house prices as an indicator of a ""strong economy"" and something to be celebrated.  If fuel and food rocketed that far ahead of inflation, there would literally be rioting

**Private rents:**

* Outright ban on BTL-specific mortgage and loan products, with a complete ban on charging rent for a property that is currently subject to a mortgage.  It would therefore become illegal to use rent money to pay off a mortgage - if you are using rent to pay off a mortgage, you cannot afford the property and should sell

* A ban on mortgages for second homes or properties that aren't your primary residence.  You should only be able to “flip” once per tax year

* Rents should be capped or appropriately proportioned based on council tax band (revised as above) and property value.  No more £1500pcm for a one-bed crack house “studio"" in Stoke Newington

* Residential properties cannot be owned by companies or trusts - named UK-based individuals only.  “Proxy-ownership” (i.e. Xin Wang Chung pays a British person to manage the property on his behalf and get around the residency restrictions while funnelling the rent money out of the country) would also be illegal

(The idea here is to make BTL a pain in the arse and discourage everyone from getting on the bandwagon as they currently are)

**Rail fares:**

* A cap on annual fare rises or a longer-term freeze

* Scrap the entire pricing structure and start again, as the current system requires a Mensa membership and even the station staff don’t always understand it

* More government subsidies for major routes (I’m not proposing re-nationalisation)

* Rail operators should be forced to divert a set proportion of their profits into fare reductions

Less on frivolities like Irish language schools for less than 20 kids and needless Ulster Scots Agencies. More on global language teaching and reducing the tax burden on small start up businesses.

Less on equality quangos and childrens commissioners. More on high quality transport infrastructure.

&gt;One thing I don't want to do is go somewhere and, not rot, but all of a sudden disappear for a while. Somewhere you don't really get a look-in. I always back myself and no matter what step I take next I want to well.
One thing I do want next year no matter where I am - and I don't know where that is going to be - is to **work with a manager who is going to coach me and really develop me as a player.** That's all you can ask for, to learn and be the best you can be. It is important that you do get football. A lot of other things can suck you in when it comes to moves and I am sure that has happened inh the past to people.
My main aim next year is, wherever I am, to play football and to enjoy it and develop. **You don't want to have a good couple of years, come through the Championship, have a good first year in the Premier League and then not play in the Premier League for another year** or so because that is a backward step. No matter what contract anyone is on it is important you are playing football. It is a short career and you have to earn a living but at the same time playing football is the best way to get better contracts anyway.",null,0,null,1429380034,null,0,false,0,cqgo76y,null,t3_331jrm,null,t1_cqgo76y,null,t3_331jrm,null,null,null,1432465442,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

&gt;The short answer to the question is no. The nationalist party, whose primary aim is Scottish independence, has only ever fielded candidates in Scotland. (There’s not even an opportunity for anyone in Scotland to vote for Sturgeon herself – she is not standing for a Westminster seat.)

What this means for example is that say SNP support Labour, but then withdraw that support after 6 months, the Conservatives then call for a vote of no confidence, government gets voted out, but no new parties can form a new government (unless SNP support the Tories) so an election is called.

The 2/3rd rule is just to stop governments calling for early elections at opportunistic times, which they still could do if they had a 2/3rds majority.

Extra support is available for people who make repeated use of the service. No-one can turn up week after week and just be given food.

In addition to that, using 2x4GB would be a tad bit better as it will utilise dual-channel technology. If you want, I can bring the price down of the RAM to £45.

null,false,cdrake64,1986,,null,"A few of my thoughts today

Hazard didn't get off to the best start today with a few odd giveaways and poor decisions, but his later play especially the run and finish on the goal exuded calmness and composure showing he wasn't rattled which is a fine quality to see in a young player. Really can't speak highly enough of him.

Ivanovic was getting absolutely fleeced by Shaw throughout the game. perhaps this would have been a good time too see Azpilicueta at right with Luis playing opposite especially since a 1-2 punch of Luis and Hazard down the left would have no doubt overwhelmed a constantly out of position Valencia. 

With that said about Ivanovic, Gary Cahill I thought did an excellent job mitigating some of the risk posed by Shaw sending the ball in from wide. After the Rooney chance early, they didn't really get a clear shot at goal no matter how dangerous Shaw's low passes were. He got a lot of shtick for his new year's form and with the emergence of Zouma but he has quietly put in some very good performances of late. 

Drogba is really frustrating me. I realize we don't really have another option right now but when the opposition is passing the ball around their backline he does these half assed presses that don't do anything except leave him in a horrible place to receive and hold up the ball if we win it back and are trying to transition back out. These would have been perfect opportunities to take advantage of a vastly inferior United backline but we just couldn't do it by going thru him. And a combo of him and Fab at no. 10 is less than ideal.

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"Plenty of things wrong (and plenty of things right ), but I think a lot of problems trace back to the quality of politicians and our reluctance to embrace change (like the av referendum). What can we do about it? Engage in politics, and not just by voting, though it is a start. Join groups that promote ideas (eg activist movements), engage with politicians, join political parties and influence of them from within, stand for elections or even create new parties. We seem to have the idea that politicians are a separate group of people who govern the country for us and if they won't agree to something it can't be done. But none of what I've suggested is impossible, politicians are just human beings like everyone else who've participated in a system that's open to everyone. It's not easy and certainly no individual has much power; it takes a group effort. But if we want to improve the country, we must all realise the power we have to change it ourselves, and use it. Not be pessimistic and decide it's too hard so you won't do anything at all.

However for all the problems with the politicians, I think it is also our fault as a public that we are so hostile and tribal about politics. That people can be instantly hated for what party they stand for rather than what they've done as an individual is absurd and discourages good people from participating in politics for fear of burning bridges.",null,0,null,1429382633,null,0,false,0,cqgplis,null,t3_331e31,null,t1_cqgplis,null,t3_331e31,null,null,null,1432466171,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt;

&gt;__Wanker__ is a term that literally means ""one who wanks ([masturbates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation))"" but has since become a general insult. It is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) term of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) origin common in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and other parts of the English-speaking world, including [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) and [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It initially referred to an ""[onanist](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/onanist)"" and is [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym) with the word *[tosser](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tosser)*.

 It must also be said that some people are on prepayment meters to cover existing debts with the energy supplier. I came across more than one case where the person had ran up a massive debt, and the prepayment meter was then installed to recoup the money (for example, you put on £10 of electric and it gives you £8 credit with £2 covering the outstanding amount owed) whilst still allowing the person to have the lights on/oven on/heating.

Most of the estate agents I've dealt with renting around Belfast have been good. It will be the standard rental agreement with deposit etc.

I sat beside a guy in my last job who had moved back from Spain and was house sharing. He said it was straight forward and saved him a good bit of cash.

Public transport around Belfast is decent, especially if you are staying around the city centre. I use the train a lot as I have a train station next to my house, but it is more expensive compared to the Metro (red bus). They do a travel card which can be topped up and means a journey is £1.10.

My advice would be this, east Belfast will be cheaper rent. South Belfast will be the most expensive (normally). Do some research. It will become apparent where you want to live and work your budget from there.

Hope this is of some help. If you have any specific questions let me know.

It stagnated and stagnated and then ran into an economic deficit no greater than 10 years after partition and it's been running on an economic deficit since. A reversal of fortunes then happened as Ulster became the poorest performing region economically in these isles. So the north was forced to adopt a begging bowl approach to politicians in England. 

The thing is, true prosperity can only come to Northern Ireland through cooperation with the rest of Ireland. That has been the secret success story of the good friday agreement. Further cross-border trade, commerce and cooperation in all areas of civic society simply makes sense economically.

If anyone watched Sky, Zouma was crucial for our tactics today.

Zouma also did a fantastic job of man marking Fellaini, and therefore their main tactic of hoofing the ball to Fellaini failed today.

The fact that we're finding ourselves with a situation where we may hold the balance of power is just good luck. And it will probably be beneficial to folk in the rest of the UK we well. Nicola sturgeon will block the tories and try to stop the labour party rolling out tory policies. 

Its ironic that its really only by virtue of the stupid and broken ""first past the post"" voting system that we're trying to escape (and which isnt the voting system in Holyrood incidentally) 

The fact that Nicola Sturgeon is going to have leverage over the tories and labour is what the ruling parties cant stand. They dont want the SNP to go into Westminster and show English people that there's an alternative, better party that's denied to the people in England. 

The SNP have defended key aspects of our society that tories (and labour) have destroyed in England. Foundation hospitals, privatised railways, charging for prescriptions. 9 grand a year for a uni education. But endless resources for wars in Iraq and afghanistan plus the 5th most costly 'defence' budget in the world.

The SNP have said they wont push for another referendum until the demand is overwhelming. 

So really it depends how Westminster behaves. 

Times are changing. And nobody is out to endanger England.

Suicide is something you do because you have a mental disease. You are suffering, and in great pain. Saying suicide is selfish is like saying people who are terminally ill from cancer, and want to be euthanized is selfish. Your statement is just plain ignorant. Furthermore, one of the main reasons people commit suicide is because they feel they don't want to be a burden on their loved ones.

For example; If you put £1 in a bank savings account then most current accounts will apply some form of interest to that account.

If you take £1 and load it onto the Steam platform to buy games (as an example) it doesn't accumulate interest. If you withdraw that £1 a year later, it's still worth only £1 (in 2016 money) even if it *should* have been worth £1.02 with interest. My point is that money doesn't automatically accumulate interest wherever it is kept.

It would depend on the terms and conditions of when this was taken out - but I suspect it **is not** subject to interest because the way this system worked was more like an early form of lottery or pools. 

Having said that, it would be worth investigating it as £1 in an account for 54 years could have something worthwhile in it... but I would go into it with fairly limited expectations.

EDIT: so it seems I need to clarify to avoid being downvoted by those in London. I live in Lancashire, and had to live with my parents for years before being able to find a property of my own, so I understand the need for more housing in the North West. However, in Preston alone there is huge areas of unused land, especially the huge amounts of abandoned industrial sites in the city centre, that would be ideal for regeneration. Instead developers go for the most desirable areas: green fields. This helps only those who can afford big 3 bed detached, rather than properties for first time buyers. I've lived in the rural north for the past 25 years, and the old joke of ""this all used to be fields"" isn't a joke any more. Those who downvoted for high rates in london: I sympathize, I do. It cant be nice. Different areas need different plans for growth. I'm just saying that regeneration provides new properties and increases surrounding value.

Our countryside is undeniably beautiful, boasting a wonderful variety of wildlife, none of which is predatory towards humans. We have carefully managed our picturesque land for generations. It is possible to be in nature's idyll within minutes of anywhere in Britain. There are national parks, areas of natural beauty, national trust land, everywhere you go in this country you're tripping over historical buildings and ancient woodland, wonderful views, rolling hills and acres upon acres publicly and privately owned land preserved and managed for the enjoyment of all. We have a clear sense of shared ownership of the land as a cultural resource. We are rightly proud of it for it is the treasure of this nation.

Things just don't kill you in this country. We live in a ludicrously safe part of the world. Neither nature, animal or fellow human is a threat to us. We have to get inside a car to face even the smallest thrill of imminent death. And the weather, honestly. We get four beautiful seasons to enjoy every year, the weather is largely predictable (it is!!) and at worst we are mildly inconvenienced or irritated by it, let alone in danger of perishing in the elements.

We have the friendliest people on the planet. What foreign visitors to our land fail to recognise is that we have perfected how to be friendly to one another without being openly gregarious. We understand how to live and let live. We have matured socially to the stage that we know not only when not to speak, but also how to be indirect about what we think when we do. We do not appreciate our advanced social diplomacy skills nearly enough. Bryson described it best for me, after clambering up some mountain or other in the Lake District. ""We made it to the top without incident. I counted thirty-three people there ahead of us, huddled among the fog-whitened boulders with sandwiches, flasks and madly fluttering maps, and tried to imagine how I would explain this to a foreign onlooker -the idea of three dozen English people having a picnic on a mountain top in an ice storm - and realized there was no way you could explain it. We trudged over to a rock, where a couple kindly moved their rucksacks and shrank their picnic space to make room for us. We sat and delved among our brown bags in the piercing wind, cracking open hard-boiled eggs with numbed fingers, sipping warm pop, eating floppy cheese-and-pickle sandwiches, and staring into an impenetrable murk that we had spent three hours climbing through to get here, and I thought, I seriously thought: God, I love this country.""",null,0,null,1429386934,null,0,false,0,cqgrw1k,null,t3_330qa0,null,t1_cqgrw1k,null,t3_330qa0,null,null,null,1432467252,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

I swear as soon as these fucking islands are mentioned the IQ of everyone involved in the conversation of Argentine or British descent drops to about a quarter of what it is normally - if you don't believe me just look at the shit being thrown in this thread from a neutral point of view. I'm not trying to shit on you guys - an Argentinean thread would be just as bad.

I was born in the UK with an Argentinean parent and I fucking hate these shitty irrelevant islands so much. I swear to God. There's so much propaganda on both sides to the point that British and Argentineans get ridiculously defensive over them when there is no need. This topic is only being bought up because Cristina is literally the worst leader in the free world and is a piece of shit human. Bring on the elections! But, that's another point for another thread.

Most Argentineans believe that it's their islands through intense propaganda. Starting at a young age. We're not a nation of idiots.

Anyway, sorry for being angry but reading through this thread has really pissed me off. I've lived in the UK my entire life and I love living in this country, it has given me some amazing opportunities, I've met amazing people and I've lived a great life. Argentina is also a great country filled with some of the most diverse landscapes, beautiful scenery and cities, fascinating culture and best food in the world. Yet here we have two groups of people from amazing countries acting like chimps throwing shit at each other because of some tiny, barely populated islands in the South Atlantic.

Sometimes I wish these islands would just sink and we could join together as nations and share our love for tea, football and Italian food.

I just want everyone to do me a favour and I know this will not be seen by many and be heeded to by even less but - next time this topic comes up just sigh, shake your head and move on. There's no use throwing shit on an entire nation of people because their President has the IQ of a doorknob. 

On the off chance that anyone actually from The Falklands read this post you probably think I'm a massive hypocrite and hate me. No worries. If your islands do sink you can crash at my place while you look for a new home :)

If so, its a truly remarkable revisionist economic theory you're on to there.

Maybe it extends? Worldwide prosperity is reliant not on global market share, but on how much trade you do with your neighbouring region. 

- Bavaria predominantly sells its BMWs to the Rhineland?
- Saxony primarily exports its VWs to Thurungia?
- The majority of Lombardy's wine, fashion and meat exports are to Piedmont?
- Piedmont, in turn, focuses its Fiat sales strategy on Liguria?
- Vaud sends its chocolate to St Gallen?
- Basel's number one pharmaceutical purchaser is Vaud?

/s - think not.

It ain't the Middle Ages anymore. Marketplaces extend a little bit beyond the nearest well paved roadway these days. Has done in fact since at least the 18th century, if not the 16th century.

Advances in the shipping, airline and online communication and transportation industries all kinda took care of that one.

If your argument worked, none of the Soviet satellite states should ever have departed the suckling teet of loving mother neighbour Russia, the Baltic states would never have succeeded, and Iceland should be economically dead in the water.

I do note you've excluded from your expert analysis of factors in Northern Ireland's economic problems, not only its heavily socialised (and private sector stifling) workforce, dependency culture encouraged by an over-generous and loophole filled welfare state, but also the results of a 30 year futile and senseless campaign of trotskite economic (not to mention human) and capital destruction waged by tinpot bereted revolutionaries high on their own sense of baby boom generation self-importance. 

But maybe you're right, the long term campaign of senseless civil and social destruction conducted (apparently on our behalves - generous fellows) by Irish Republicanism has nothing to do with our shit economic state of affairs.

Its all to do with our farmers not being able to sell their milk to Dublin, or some such thing.

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"For me, there are two (almost exclusive) answers to this question, depending on my mood.

Firstly, let's say I'm a big lefty who wants all sorts of lefty things to be implemented. The likes of the Greens have a manifesto promising every lefty policy you could dream of. But is it realistic? I want good social democratic / democratic socialist policies implemented, but not at the expense of having a working country. It's easy for the Greens/etc. to offer the moon on a stick if they never have to worry about implementing them. I have faith that Labour can deliver what they promise, and promise only what they think they can deliver. Labour promise that the minimum wage will rise to £8 in 4 years. Do I wish it could be more? £10? £15? Sure. But I know that Labour will deliver it and the country can afford it, while for other parties it is an empty promise to win my vote.

Secondly- maybe I'm just not as left wing as some of these parties. Labour might genuinely be the party for me. I consider myself in solidly democratic socialist territory, and I felt that Blair's New Labour was too right wing for me. But Miliband's Labour of today ticks an awful lot of my boxes. Take the rail thing- Labour's manifesto promises to set up a public sector rail operator which will compete for rail franchises, winning them off private operators wherever they can offer a better deal. To me, this is a perfect policy- nationalisation wherever it makes sense to do so, privatisation wherever it is genuinely able to do better. Parties offering total renationalisation NOW are basically saying ""let's do it even if it doesn't make sense"". That just doesn't appeal to me. Apply that logic to any policy area where Labour are ""left"", but others are more so, and you get where I'm coming from.

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt;  Arguing that the majority of a car's environmental impact is inflicted in manufacturing rather than operations when the literature collectively indicates otherwise is NOT a reasonable position at all.

Except the literature doesn't (and cannot accurately) state that. Breaking down component parts into who made them and what component parts were needed to make the machines that made them ad infinitum becomes nonsensical but the notion that more complex and unique components have greater environmental impact is a sound one. 

&gt; Not when Hawkins et al's carbon debt values given are grossly higher than the other lifecycle analyses, including Notter et al, one of their own parent papers, and contains numerous estimation errors as outlined by Robert Llwellyn.

But Notter looks at optimal rather than typical life. Some batteries may be taken out and recycled, others won't and may be sold for scrap. This radically affects the carbon debt values and initiatives like the scrappage scheme cannot be predicted ahead of time.

&gt; The lifecycle analyses by Notter et al and the UCLA spend their entire papers enumerating all the individual impacts, and putting them into context of the full lifecycle.

But again assuming optimisation. 

&gt; Zehner, meanwhile, spends his time launching pre-emptive ad hominem arguments, and taking numbers out of context and blowing them up to make them look far worse than they really are. You can't possibly tell me those two are the same.

Zehner isn't producing a paper for peer review but even so I've already stated my views on microemissions and the problems that they cause which cannot be entirely retracted from CO2. 

&gt; Notter et al and the UCLA argue otherwise, and Hawkins et al's own paper notes that electric cars have lower global warming potential than normal cars.

Correct me if I am wrong but that is entirely dependent on how the fuel for them is produced and stored with current methodology being primarily fossil.

2. The longer you earn less than 21k, the less likely you are to ever actually pay any of the interest at all. 

3. Of course you are earning interest in the process.... just like the personal loan.

4. Again, the longer you don't have a job for, the less likely it is you will every pay interest, only capital. If you retire early, you need not worry. 

5. I mean, really your wages aren't garnished, as, you would hope that having gone to university you are earning more than if you hadn't. So that's not at all a problem. Since your wages should've been higher for 30yrs even after the deduction than if you had gone into the field without a degree.

6. Yes it affects the income you can use to pay (and apply for the mortgage) but it does not affect how much you can borrow in terms of - the bank can lend you 80k but minus 50k for your student loan debt. If it were a personal loan it would affect the total amount you could borrow like that. If you are financially stretched, a personal loan would be worse as the bailiffs could be round. 

7. Yes, 5.5% is pretty low, sorry. Credit cards are typically 15% or more, and private american college loans are anywhere between 5-10%. So its not huge in that regard, and I might remind you that mortgages and loans are at a huge low, they too will go up. In fact, a sensible affordability check for a mortgage is wether you could afford the repayments if interest hit double figures. With the student loan, no worries, payment remains the same. 

8. Yes. 

If the deal is so bad, compare it to either the american style system or (similarly) just taking out a loan from a bank at the start of uni, and starting payments at graduation. I'm sorry you don't think its a good deal, but if you have the cash and you don't take the loan you are an idiot.

For some reason that makes me uncomfortable - I'm not sure if I would say it's misleading but it definitely manufactures buzz around the medium of television. 

The creator of the show said -  ""Everyone loves watching TV and talking about TV. But the show isn't really about TV. The show is about people's lives, their relationships, their living rooms and the way children and parents talk about TV. It's near real-time because you're watching what happened in the seven days before. That’s quite priceless. It captures a cultural response to something that's happening in the world. Gogglebox shows TV in people's living rooms is alive and well and thriving. It is asserting the indispensable role of TV in the fabric of people's lives.""

Idk, there's just something weirdly masturbatory about a tv show propagating the medium of tv and it's role in our lives. It makes me wonder how much peoples' perceptions of current affairs and entertainment are dictated to them by television.

What is an abatement notice?
An abatement notice can be served by the local authority if they are satisfied that a noise problem amounts to a statutory nuisance. The notice may require that the noise be stopped altogether or limited to certain times of day. The notice can be served on the person responsible for the noise, who then has 21 days to appeal.

emergency services on 999. You should
contact your local authority, usually the
environmental health department. The
number will be in your local telephone directory.  
If they visit or witness the noise and agree
that it is a statutory nuisance, they must
take immediate action.  
If the noise happens
from time to time, they may ask you to keep
a diary of when the noise happens, or leave
equipment to record it.   
Sometimes they will measure the noise as part of their investigation
into a complaint. There is no set level at
which noise becomes a statutory nuisance.

There is a bus service that runs from Dent Station to Dent itself, Dalesbus is the company who runs it, and the [timetables can be seen here](http://www.dalesbus.org/index.html). I think the summer bus time table should be running in June, but there may be different services between Monday to Friday, and Saturdays and Sundays.

In terms of accommodation, the [village/dale website has a few suggestions](http://www.dentdale.com/). I've been to The George and Dragon a few times and its been a good pub, good beer and food. Not tried their rooms (as I'm fairly local), but I can't see them being bad.

As for things to do, it depends on what your interested in doing. If you like walking, then Whernside is a good walk you can do from Dent. [Here is a good route](http://where2walk.co.uk/yorkshire_dales/dales_summits_walks/whernside-from-dent/). I'd recommend you get the proper map if you want to do it, the [OS 1:25,000 OL2: Yorkshire Dales: Southern and Western Areas](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-yorkshire-dales-southern-western-area.html) would be the one you want.

In Dent, your really close to an entire network of footpaths in the Eastern Lakes, or How Gill Fells. The village website has some walks on there. You can use a site like [Mapometer](http://gb.mapometer.com/) to see where the footpaths are, but I would recommend a walking guide like the [Ciceron The Lune Valley and Howgills - a Walking Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Lune-Valley-Howgills-Walking/dp/1852846682/ref=pd_rhf_dp_s_cp_6_GSWM?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0DFSMHRWXEK7MHQGENE6) and the appropriate OS map to fully plan walks.

As for none walking stuff, [Dent Brewery](http://www.dentbrewery.co.uk/) is nearby, they may be able to do a small tour of the brewery for you if you get in touch with them before you travel. You could easily get the bus into [Kendal](http://www.visitcumbria.com/sl/kendal/), train to [Windermere](http://www.visitcumbria.com/amb/windermere-lake/) if you fancy the Lake District, or you can get the bus to [Hawes](http://www.yorkshire.com/places/yorkshire-dales/hawes) in [Wensleydale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wensleydale) where there are shops, tea rooms, a Rope Museum (the height of exitment I can tell you!) and the [Wensleydale Creamery](http://www.wensleydale.co.uk/) where the make the (apparently) world famous cheese (its worth a visit, if only for the free samples of their cheese!). There is a good couple of walks from Hawes as well.

Dent Station is on the[ Settle to Carisle](http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/) train line which is one of the most picturesque routes in the country, they often run steam trains in the summer. You could easily get the train to [Carisle](http://www.discovercarlisle.co.uk/),[ Settle](http://www.settle.org.uk/), [Skipton](http://www.welcometoskipton.com/) or all the way to [Leeds](http://www.visitleeds.co.uk/#) if cities are your thing.

If travelling by train, I would recommend you check the train times using a site like the [National Rail Enquiries](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) as sometimes trains are infrequent to the smaller stations, or the last train isn't actually that late.

Ever notice how when you go into a TK Maxx it seems they're always slightly ahead of the curve with their stuff? They start selling winter clothes in like August before everyone else? It's because they're selling stuff from last season.

Except skincare doesn't have a season, we wash our face everyday (hopefully) most of their skincare stuff is because someone messed up and bought too much and is now trying to offload it, or the manufacturer changed their packaging recently and now they want to get rid of their back stock with the old packaging. Stores go out of business, or shut down and then they need to get rid of stock quickly. They make more money selling their stock on to places like TK Maxx then they do having a discount sale where stuff progressively gets cheaper and cheaper until they're basically giving it away. 

Really buying things at TK Maxx you don't have much more assurance that their products aren't from a few months ago any more then you do that it hasn't sat in some Amazon warehouse for a few months. They aren't as brand new as if they buy them at a really busy Boots or direct from the manufacturer, but they're not going to be too old either. 

Personally, i wouldn't buy something like Vitamin C that is relatively unstable, but a basic skin cream isn't going to be a problem. Oils don't really expire unless they're opened.

Disgusting working class scum that they are.  They're even taking holidays now.  Good god.

HOW DARE THEY!  This is an outrage.  

&gt;These creatine-addled lads don’t get very creative with their tattoos either, marked with a design their mates pulled from the third page of Google images under the search “Sleeve Tattoos for men”.

Working class lads don't have creative tattoos?  Is that true?  Who cares!

I think this (the Stored Program Computer) is the critical point on the path of invention.

Secondly, though he pioneered the use of valves on a large scale for computation, which was important not only to the war effort at the time but the development of more general purpose computers later, this was more a matter of implementation rather than the fundamental invention of the computer.

I do, however, totally agree that we need to realise that an economy based on ever rising house prices is a weak economy, not a strong one.

So here's my suggestions:

* Introduce a land value tax, paid for by the owner, not the tenant.  We need to see investment in property (&amp; land), as a 2nd choice to traditional investment in stocks &amp; shares.
* We need to free up land for building.  This is the only way to change the situation (apart a spot of light genocide).  Pretending we can house another 10million people in the same area as the 60m already here is laughable.

So I suggest: all councils are required to allocate enough land for an increase of, say 3%, housing per annum.  Where they do this &amp; how they do this is up to them.  Any council that refuses, is fined, directly onto council tax.  You could even allow trading between councils.  But we need to make unpopular decisions &amp; for some reason any building is bad building.

**Help for young men**

Men may be more likely to avoid or ignore problems and many are reluctant to talk about their feelings or seek help when they need it.

A support group called the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is an excellent resource for young men who are feeling unhappy. As well as their website, CALM also has a helpline (0800 58 58 58).
Talking to someone you trust

If you don't want to speak to someone on a helpline, you could talk to:
a member of your family, a friend or someone you trust, such as a teacher
your GP, a mental healthcare professional or another healthcare professional    a minister, priest or other type of faith leader

**Seeing your GP**

It would also help to see your GP. They can advise you about appropriate treatment if they think you have a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety.

Your GP may be able to help you with access to talking therapies. Talking therapies, such as counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), are often used to help people who have suicidal thoughts and usually involve talking about your feelings with a professional.",null,0,null,1429397084,null,0,false,0,cqgww4p,null,t3_331qxg,null,t1_cqgww4p,null,t3_331qxg,null,null,null,1432469620,null,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25,null

&gt;Probationary periods
--
&gt;It is common for employers to treat new employees as being in a ‘probationary’ period when they first start work. The employer may then argue that you can be dismissed while you are in this probationary period with no warning (notice). **Employers also often argue that employees do not have usual employment rights to, for example, pay or holidays, during this ‘probationary’ period.**

&gt;**There is no such thing in law as a ‘probationary’ period.** Once you have started work, the number of weeks you have worked begin on the day you start, not from some time when a ‘probationary’ period is over. Your full contractual rights also start from the first day of work, unless your contract says otherwise.

&gt;Your contract could, however, contain terms which only apply during your probationary period and which are less favourable than those which apply when your probationary period has ended. These terms must not take away your statutory rights.

&gt;Your employer can extend your probationary period, as long as your contract says they can do this. For example, your employer may want to extend your probationary period in order to have more time to assess your performance. However, they can only do this if your contract has a term which says your probationary period can be extended under these circumstances.",null,0,null,1429397387,null,0,1429437768,0,cqgx142,null,t3_332fkl,null,t1_cqgx142,null,t3_332fkl,null,null,null,1432469685,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

null,false,HH-Rob,null,null,null,"Feel free to criticize me but I honestly think Cahill will be a worthy successor to JT for a few years in terms of defensive capability. 

He hasn't had the best season. Ivanovic's attacking prowess certainly didn't do him any favours either. With that being said however, Cahill has a tremendous blocking and positioning ability that stop chances like this from happening in the first place in addition to (as we see now) blocking them.

He thrives when he's plays in that deeper centre-back roll - which Terry has occupied for Chelsea.

When JT (*gulp*) comes to the end of his decorated career and Zouma solidifies his place, I can see Cahill being the ""Terry-type"" of defender who will replace him.

He might carry the same aura about him in terms of leadership . . . I mean who realistically can? But I feel that his ability will really shine when being allowed to play in this position by himself.

Having an athletic Zouma next to him who can distribute balls further up whilst tracking back effectively will compliment Cahill immensely. He's already quite good on the ball but really thrives doing this from a deeper position.

Anyways, we'll see how it goes but I'm quite happy how today's game worked out.

On a side note, in terms of today's game I thought Matic did reasonably well but hasn't returned to his early season form where he ""truly"" dominated the midfield. Something I think he did when he played a bit further back (He pushes up quite far from a DM imo).

Fabergas had a good run too however physicality is his main issue and where he falters. If I had to make a radical prediction for next season I could see this being addressed with the purchase of a new midfielder meaning that either Willian/Oscar/Cuadaro or even Fabergas getting fewer games.

I do feel whilst we have the talent individually for these positions, however, the system and style-of-play we currently undertake doesn't allow them to thrive at the moment, and can only be rectified by the purchase of a larger, ball-playing, and offensive midfielder - à la - Veratti, Pogba, Vidal, Toure etc. Someone who just guns for the goal similar to Lampard.

That said, I think Hogfather was a FANTASTIC effort and probably the best adaptation, even though like with all of them they missed bits out.

I think it's one of Pratchett's best books. I particularly love Death's little lies speech. I think they could have done the Auditors a little better though, then again they have so much more of a part in Thief of Time (this one REALLY needs an adaptation as well!)

I did not like how much David Jason is reused though. He shouldn't be both Rincewind and Albert.

The worst was Going Postal. They had this wonderful opportunity to realise these beautiful ghostly images of the old post office at work and they didn't do it.

As for TCOM/TLF, I was upset that they didn't keep twoflower speaking a different language but did it all in english. it made a lot less sense for Rincewind to approach him when there was no need for translation.

Like quality of care? Because nobody cares about quality of care... If you look at this article in the [British Medical Journal](http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1079) discussing the report they do bring up issues with 'outcome measures' (ie effectivity of treatment) but otherwise broadly agree with the concerns. I think I'm more inclined to trust the BMJ for a lack of bias than I am agenda-driven right-wing **economics** thinktanks, or newspapers/websites.

There are countless measures that do indicate the NHS provides world class high quality care. e.g.

&gt; The UK had the lowest percentage of patients who had experienced medical or other errors in the past two years, as well as the highest percentage whose prescriptions were kept under review.

I'm not sure what you're saying at the end there but to be clear: dyslexia is a learning disability, not a mental illness (they are different things). The likelihood is that this man's anxiety over his job, his pending fatherhood and his dyslexia triggered a period of mental illness that went untreated. Like physical conditions, some can be fatal when ignored. This is fact and science, not just people ""throwing the disease card"". Generally speaking, people do not kill themselves without first falling into a severely altered, distressed and irrational state of mind. I can tell you that from experience.

In my work, it's technical and you have to interact with all sorts of people.  Whenever we hire someone, they go through the usual interview and are told ahead of time they may need to role play or demonstrate their work ethos by interacting with people in the job.

So they have the interview from the manager, and then they're sent over to the staff they would be working under/with and are supervised by the experienced staff who have been here decades and we evaluate their technical skills, how they talk to other people and interaction with clients.  We also ask informal questions about their background and hobbies, do the more personal side such as interests.  Then they're taken away for a followup interview, and the interviewer asks us how they did, what you thought of them, would they be a fit, Most people are guarded when talking to managers and HR and relax when given a chance to talk to those they may be working with.


They don't get paid for what they do, but they're only here for 15 to 30 minutes and don't really do any work, they're essentially hanging out while the interviewer interviews the next person.

The bacillus calmette–guerin vaccine isn't used for cattle in Europe because it we don't have a DIVA test. DIVA means differentiating infected from vaccinated animals. The trouble with the BCG vaccine is after you've been vaccinated we can't do a normal TB skin test to you as you may* get a false positive. In humans we have to do a mantoux or heaf test before we vaccinate you to make sure you don't have TB. 

The big problem is this the BCG vaccine isn't that great. It relied heavily on heard immunity because in a individual it was terrible. One of the reasons we stopped routine use of it in the UK was because it just wasn't worth the effort. In cattle where the possible exposure to TB is higher than most humans it would fail a lot.

In short significant failure rate along with making TB testing hard made the EU outlaw use of the BCG vaccine in cattle.

However new tests are being developed as well as the other vaccines. It is something we're working towards and some day in the future will probably use but for now at least it's not an option.

although cannibalism may go way back into our evolution, so i'm surprised prion diseases didn't catch up with us sooner, on that note, we may have developed some resistance along the way:

[In 2003 a publication in Science received a large amount of press attention when it suggested that early humans may have practiced extensive cannibalism.\[20\][21] **According to this research, genetic markers commonly found in modern humans worldwide suggest that today many people carry a gene that evolved as protection against the brain diseases that can be spread by consuming human brain tissue.**[22] A 2006 reanalysis of the data questioned this hypothesis,[23] as it claimed to have found a data collection bias, which led to an erroneous conclusion.[24] This claimed bias came from incidents of cannibalism used in the analysis not being due to local cultures, but having been carried out by explorers, stranded seafarers or escaped convicts.[25] The original authors published a subsequent paper in 2008 defending their conclusions.[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism#Medical_aspects)

there are also theories which suggest that at some point in our evolution, eating brains of other animals combined with our use of fire/cooking might have jump started our early ancestors' cognitive development. so prion diseases might have posed a lesser risk than we now associate with them?

On a visceral level, there's something about him that makes him seem utterly charmless to me, but my greatest specific issue is this:  As the Secretary of State for Children, Ed Balls publicly sacked Sharon Shoesmith.  Shoesmith was the Director for Childrens' Services at Haringay Council, at the time of the Baby P case.

Now, when I say he 'publicly sacked' her, what I mean is he held a press conference and told the world she'd be put out of her job **without anyone having even told her in advance of it**.

Because instead of ensuring the job was done properly, Balls decided this was an awesome opportunity to look like the big man and overstepped his mark Shoesmith unsurprisingly won an unfair dismissal case at the Employment Tribunal.  I don't find it credible that no one in Balls' retinue didn't appraise him of the fact it couldn't possibly stick.  In effect Balls cost taxpayers about £600,000 in order to buy himself some media attention.

And the icing on the cake, at the point where she was put in her job again he failed utterly to acknowledge either to her individually or to the public he had failed that he wasn't right.

NB:  I have no objection to senior public sector workers being castigated and punished for their failures.  What I do have a problem with and what Balls did, is the usual routine:  Act purely to be seen to act, without actually making anything better.  Screw up everything procedurally in a way that squanders huge amounts of other people's money.

I'd be very surprised if profit is the main cost of the current setup — I suspect it's mostly in organisational overheads.

This isn't even getting started on the idea of allowing the public sector to bid for franchises — we'd have paying taxpayers' money on the (really expensive) bids, and we'd have the public sector able to undercut the private sector because they don't require a profit.



*IF* we want to scrap the privatised network, the only realistic way is to have one or just a few monolithic entities, like British Rail. Probably a sectorised structure would be best (that is, after all, the final stage in BR's evolution before its time was cut short, and was the most efficient). The main issue, I think, is not whether it's public or private, but how much investment and subsidy it gets. Since privatisation, investment and subsidy have both risen massively.

null,false,prototype45,null,null,null,"Perhaps Cahill may end up becoming a good captain but I'm not too confident he will. Some players just have that leadership about them that I feel Cahill doesn't have, like it's just part of them. Terry had it even when he was young, Varane has it, Gerrard had it, etc.  Last year I think it was when Terry missed games (and Cahill was in good form), he played very bad. He looked lost, he needed a leader like Terry next to him. Without Terry he was even more shaky than he showed this season. It needs to be sort of ""built-in"" to them for a lack of better words. 

Not just off the pitch, but will he be able to raise the moral of the team when 2-1 down at half time? Maybe, he might. But I just think there might be better players on the team to take over the captaincy role, and whoever it is I can only hope they become half the captain that Terry is. 

On your other points, I feel like Fabregas's drop in form *may* have also something to do with how much less dominant Matic has been. When Matic dominated in the first half of the season, cesc had much more freedom and space to do what he wanted and find killer passes. But now with Matic being far less dominant, cesc has a bigger share of the defensive work than he had early in the season. Ofcourse, like I said that's not the entirety of the reason. A few games ago he couldn't make a simple pass to save his life, his form *does* indeed tend to dip in the second half of the season as history has proven. 

Either way, I feel that even with his drop in form, he is still far too crucial for us to not start. If anyone does end up being replaced, I would assume it would be Oscar or Willian or Cuadrado. 

I do agree with your point about a lampard-esque midfielder, someone who can just shoot outside the box, someone who can score because we're relying too much on Hazard right now who will not keep up this form forever. Eventually we'll need someone other than him or a fabregas ping to costa to bring us goals.
