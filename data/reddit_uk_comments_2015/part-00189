if you have a door that opens by the low tech way you are instantly limited. 

if you open a door by hand then you are limited in how big a door you can open, if it is too heavy you can't open it.

while this may be fine for the limited use of the door. for example a living room door does not need to be a 5 tone blast door. but the ability high tech gives to infinitely upgrade anything is useful.

if you have an automatic door and then later you want an alarm to warn you when someone opens it you can, if you want to add a key-card system you can, if you add a vacuum robot that could not open a normal door it can.

it's the ability to upgrade and always improve things ones you start down the road of high-tech that makes it always better.

 Blair ran in 97 with the promise to renationalise the railways and it didn't happen. Fact is Labour planned to uphold and bring in workfare, that's the polar opposite of left wing.

 No Labour government reversed any of Thatcher's anti-trade union laws. Ed said he was a socialist at the start of his leadership and by the end he was telling one-nation tories ""I'll be your champion."" The failure of Labour is down to trust for me. 

Miliband didn't gain the trust of the electorate that they wouldn't go into coalition with the SNP, as well as the public not trusting Labour with the economy after the narrative set up by the Tories. 

If Labour stopped picking and choosing populist polices such as the ones you mentioned and actually stood for something across the board they might have done better.

 Labour's image certainly isn't helped by shit like David Miliband, Mandelson and other Blairites coming out in the days after the elections with scathing and frankly appalling criticisms of Ed's campaign. 

The Blairites talk the talk of not wanting a split in the party, but they've been the main agitators so far. 

I've went into a rant and I could go on all day about what's wrong with Labour, but to get back to your original point, some of those polices aren't even leftist.

As far as I see it, we're just as vulnerable now to some big losses as we were under AVB's second campaign.  Defensively we're a shambles, and it will take some big shifts in personnel and tactical approach in order to turn that around come August.

I don't think anyone particularly wants Poch out of here any time soon, but by the same token, he needs to prove to Levy and the fans that he's worth keeping around.  A whole season with little to show for it other than a couple of high profile wins (which, let's face it, is about as many as Leicester have managed), and with one of the worst defensive records in the division, we need to be realistic that we got lucky with Kane, and without him we'd struggle to be in the top half of the table.

Poch needs to be somewhat answerable to that, which doesn't mean losing his job, but it also doesn't mean we should just blindly support him as though getting another season and bringing in ""his players"" will suddenly turn things around.

Technically, the voucher is worth about £38 (plus pence), BUT most high street opticians will round it up to cover their lowest tier of glasses, whatever that happens to be.

The place I used to work at, the minimum price was £39 (back then the vouchers were a little less, about £36). they also did 2 for 1 offers or things like free sunglasses upgrades or whatever. The way they worked it for NHS customers was that you could have 1 pair from the lower price range completely free, OR go for the 2 for one offer (or whatever other offer was on at the time) and just get the cash value of the voucher as a discount.

Quite often, but not always, these offers will be limited so that they only apply if you have your eye test and order glasses from the same optician. IMHO Vision Express are on the pricier end. I got my most recent specs from Asda opticians and I couldn't really fault them, but my mum had an issue where the frame she ordered for her sunglasses was discontinued and it meant she has gone on holiday with no sunspecs :/

Another thing to consider is ""optional"" extras. Things like scratch-resistant coatings or glare reduction coatings. These WILL bump the price up, sometimes quite a lot. I'd recommend scratch coatings to anyone, but the anti reflective coating is more dependent on your lifestyle. Someone who sits in front of a computer all day would benefit from having it, for instance.

People who expected big names last summer weren't being realistic. One very good season doesn't whitewash 4 consecutive shite seasons before it. That's why Sanchez chose a team that consistently makes it to the knockout rounds of the CL every season over one that nearly won the league, but averaged 6th in the 4 seasons before that and just lost their best player. That's why Di Maria could say ""United last season was a blip, they usually compete for the title"" and be happy to go there rather than hold out until PSG came in for him.

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"Note that under the German system we'd have much much larger constituencies. For instance Germany only has 299 constituencies (we have 650). To explain further, you vote twice, for a local MP &amp; that from a list of regional party candidates (you vote for the party, and their candidate list will vary depending upon region). There are a specific number of mandates (seats) parties can win, every time they win a constituency mandate they lose one mandate from the party list mandates. 

So say there are 100 constituencies &amp; 100 list mandates (200 seats in total). The Conservatives win 20 constituencies &amp; 30% of the vote on the second list ballot. They would then gain 30 seats. If they won 30 constituencies and 30% of the vote on the second ballot they would get 30 seats. If they got 0 constituencies but 30% of the vote on the second ballot they'd again get 30 seats. 

Note that they need to get at least 5% of the vote on the regional list ballot to get any mandates. So this would help to keep fringe groups like the BNP from getting seats.

He's definitely achieved more than Rodgers has, and I'd be happy if he managed us - but let's be realistic. 

It'd probably mean another season of transition while he and the squad got used to each other, he'd still have to work under our bumbling transfer committee, and he'll find it tougher in the Premier League than in Germany because of how physical it is here (making it harder for him to institute his fierce pressing regularly) and how many other big teams there are in this league.

I've suggested before that they could easily require a login for the iPlayer website to be able to access the content normally provided by a license fee. Even without opening it up to foreign markets this would still help keep customers if they could access all the TV.  

There are always a few replies of ""it costs too much!"".  Well no, it doesn't. It does not cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to paywall your website. Many newspapers have done so without spending that money.

It also wouldn't cost them much extra in storage and bandwidth as they already run this service, just not live as it is broadcast. The only extra bandwidth would be from live streaming, something only a very small minority of people actually do. 

If the BBC don't start moving forward and looking into ways to provide content in a manner that the public clearly want (on demand shows, no waiting for set times), they're only going to start losing more customers.

The problem is that whenever things like this come up in the corporate world there are usually two options. 1) Move forward and innovate. 2) Push for laws that stifle competition. 

Let's just hope they don't pick option 2, because all that will do is push people to pirate the content they want to see.

From what I gather the TUPE law means that all existing employee's rights are ""protected"" and previous contracts carry over to a new employer, if they wish to change contracts they also have to include everything that existed within the previous contract and cannot remove anything. This makes old contracts also carry over without having to re-sign anything for existing employees.

They did not sign a contract with the party now in ownership, they signed a contract with the former party and weren't around for the change or any formality of the change.

Not world class, yet. He had talent in droves. But he wasnt Kaka class yet. Or Gerrard class even. 

&gt; Hamann

2002, yes. 2006, not one appearance, if I recall right. 

&gt; Xabi, Hamann, 

In their prime? Xabi was nowhere near his 'prime' then, Hamann was on the decline. And however, even if you compare, the midfield didnt stand one chance against Milans. 

Also, it was the same midfield, bar Hamann, that conceded 3 in the first half. 

&gt;The one name you missed out is Nesta

Yup. That team was filled with stars.

Get something on paper with her writing.  Preferably signed.  The most important thing is to have proof of contract.  It doesn't matter if it says she will pay a fiver a month.  Draw it up yourself including dates and get her to sign it and agree, with the proviso that when she is able to pay more, she shall.  That, at least, can be used in a civil claim should she default again.

With the right personnel in place, with how large LFC is globally, we could truly command some pretty heavy income and skyrocket the value which they will get.  There is one thing we can count on at least.  These guys didn't get rich by being bad with money. They also didn't find so much success with the Red Sox by being bad at sports. 

What I think has happened honestly is FSG believes the squad of players they have bought are being played incorrectly. They most likely believe this, because of how many insanely high profile people like and respect this football club and have probably told them so.  Hell they could have even been speaking to some new manager who  has more clout and has convinced them as well. If Rodgers had managed to actually secure a top four spot, especially recently given how the top 4 keep dropping points, things may have been different.  But I have to imagine that the timing of Klopp leaving Dortmund, and the sharp decline of our team are too big of a coincidence. Let's just say I would be flabbergasted if a managerial change isn't made because FSG aren't going to fire themselves.

The reason being why electoral reform is more on agenda now for a lot more people is because recent election has highlighted why FPTP isn't actually fair or really as democratic as people used to believe. This election smaller parties did much better in the voting than ever before, yet came on considerable worst than the main parties which FPTP benefits in respect to the votes actually received in representation.

For example UKIP got nearly 4 million votes and got 1 MP. Greens 1.2 million 1 MP. SNP who got same number of votes as Greens gets 56 MPs.

As for Tories and Labours they averaged at about 25k and 35k votes per MP.  So Tories, Labour and SNP in effect are getting much more representation for their votes than UKIP or Greens.

That can be hardly be called fair or democratic, thus why people wish for a better voting system. 

A ""fraction of people"" might not like Tories, a ""fraction of people"" who arguing for PR probably dislike UKIP even more. But PR would vastly benefit the UKIP party and others who might not be on the far-left.  But then at least people would feel the result would of been more democratic. Also as pointed out before if the votes had been casted in exact same manor under a PR system Tories still would of got the most MP's.

So it doesn't seem like the ""fraction of people"" or ""far-left"" would got much out of a PR system this election at all as far as who in charge of the country over all.",null,0,null,1432103932,null,0,false,0,creza8t,null,t3_36d8jm,null,t1_creza8t,null,t1_cremknd,null,null,null,1433164470,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Actually, not the OP - just been reading up on this since it's been a bit of a political football over here (N. Ireland), and it's one I'm also a bit mixed on - I think that level of service-based discrimination is probably not one we should actually outright disallow, but I *can* see how it could cross into outright discrimination on the basis of proxy discrimination, which is maybe just a matter of degree.

&gt;Perhaps the most questionable line

Yeah, that seemed a bit iffy to me too at first.  I *think* what he may be saying there is that it's impossible to discriminate on the basis of one without also discriminating on the basis of the other (ie. like a spurious height requirement would effectively discriminate against women).  OTOH, he does later go on to say he did think it amounted to *direct* discrimination, which I don't think really works (though he says if he'd only found it to be indirect discriminationm it wouldn't have changed the result).

I think the argument about it being discrimination based on a political opinion was probably a better one than the one based on sexual orientation, and I do think there are justifications there.  (Eg. we could imagine a copy shop chain refusing to print promotional material for one political party etc, or only one side of an issue - this does seem something we'd want to avoid)

  You can now go out on a Monday night and watch that band that she hated. You can sit about in bed and play computer games for a whole weekend if you want to. No one is going to hump the duvet onto your in the middle of the night and make you too hot, or pull it off you when you're cold. No more other-people poo streaks in your toilet. You can get rid of those stupid fucking throw cushions, you can replace the pictures that you never really liked with Art Deco prints of Hulk, Spiderman, Iron Man and no one is going to call you a man-child. Join meet-up and do things you never knew existed in your area, take random weekends away when they suit you, see your mates you haven't seen for ages. Smoke a spliff in the bath with a glass of wine listening to Tool, or Motorhead, or whatever else you bloody well want to listen to. Go play 5 a side with your mates, come home muddy and crack a beer in your pants.

With some research there appears to be a bit more complicated ways of doing this, but in a very simplistic way this is how it works.  Another lazier way of actually voting, if you don't want to assign preferences is that each party does their own preference deal so the Conservatives might allocate their 2nd preference to the LibDems and their 3rd preference to UKIP and 4th to Labour etc. and you just select the party.",null,0,null,1432108835,null,0,false,0,crf0lgl,null,t3_36jiqh,null,t1_crf0lgl,null,t3_36jiqh,null,null,null,1433165088,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;How can same-sex marriage be 'inextricably linked' to sexual relations when same sex marriage isn't even legal

The argument is that **support** for same-sex marriage is so linked.  That this is a political opinion disproportionately held by homosexuals.  The [law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1998/3162/article/3/made) being cited explicitly spells out that discrimination includes:

&gt;&gt;(b) he applies to that other a requirement or condition which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same religious belief or political opinion as that other but—

&gt;&gt;(i)which is such that the proportion of persons of the same religious belief or of the same political opinion as that other who can comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportion of persons not of that religious belief or, as the case requires, not of that political opinion who can comply with it;

Here there are effectively two arguments that can apply from this:

1. those supporting gay marriage are, in fact, disproportionately gay (a random gay person is more likely to support it than a random straight person).  Ie. the 2(b)(i) clause.  It's thus indirectly discriminating based on orientation in the same way that, say, refusing to serve people shorter than 5'5"" would be discriminating based on gender (since women are disproportionately below that height).

2. The act explicitly disallows *political opinion* anyway as grounds for discrimination.  Ie. even if you ignore the indirect discrimination on sexual identity, there's direct discrimination based on poltical opinion going on. One group are allowed to make cakes supporting their opinion (the judge's ""support heteroxexual marriage"" example), while another aren't.  I suspect your political examples would indeed be illegal based on this.

Personally, the second of these seems stronger to me (I'm a bit dubious of the first too), and there do seem to be good reasons to support it.  Eg. suppose I were run a copy shop that refused to print leaflets supporting political party A, but did for political party B.  This seems like clear discrimination on political opinion, and saying you'd allow people of party A to print ""Support party B"" leaflets doesn't seem relevant - you're still disallowing them to express *their* viewpoint, on the basis of nothing other than the actual political opinion being expressed itself, rather than something else (ie. if you disallowed it based on something applicable to both orientations / political opinions)",null,0,null,1432109677,null,0,1432109990,0,crf0sq7,null,t3_36gzst,null,t1_crf0sq7,null,t1_cre2f0h,null,null,null,1433165183,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

null,false,AdrianBlake,null,null,null,"Not to put you down, the idea would be a good technical challenge for sure, but even ignoring the issue your boyfriend mentioned, water waste is primarily a supply and or business issue. 

We send 17 billion litres of water through the pipes every day in the UK. That's about 280 litres per person in the UK (including babies). And there are leaks in those thousands of kilometres of  pipes. [The people in charge of making sure water waste is minimised say that there is no point in fixing all of those leaks](http://www.ccwater.org.uk/waterissues/currentkeywaterissues/leakage/). If you look at that link, there is a table near the top with targets for leakages for water companies (which are often missed). Those numbers are megalitres (one Ml is 1,000,000 litres) per day. That's 3.25 billion litres a day. There are roughly 60million people in the UK. So that's about 54ish litres per person, that is just lost getting to them.

That's because even if the companies could find all the leaks (they can't) then the cost to repair is prohibitive unless the cost of the repair is less than the cost of getting more water to replace that water lost. They advise water companies not to bother if it isn't cost effective.

Some figures show that a quarter of all water that goes into sewage is directly from supply pipes, not having gone anywhere.

Then you get to business use, and it so dwarfs the domestic use, that realistically, cutting down on personal usage by (realistically) a few litres a day, means nothing to the grand scheme of things. You do not use 280 litres of water a day (or rather 230, as 50 is lost in transit for every 280 delivered), you use very little really. Most water is used on crops, in manufacture, in a variety of businesses. 

That's why people get so pissed off when the water companies say ""oh you can't use your hoses!!!"" Because all the data shows it does sweet FA to reducing water usage, because businesses still have to keep going, so they use just as much as before.


**THAT SAID!!!!** It could have non-UK applications. If you made a water saving device and marketed it in rural 3rd world areas where water usage is much more restricted, then you could have a meaningful positive effect on people's lives.

I often wonder how the UK is seen from other countries, especially South America, as well. I mean we used to have an empire, but we're really just a tiny island now, not really that relevant to global politics anymore. If the U.S. says jump we do it, but otherwise we a shadow compared to the ""glory days"".

Admittedly the only feedback I read about is from South America is from Argentina, who are always spouting about out ""imperialistic nature"". Which rings a bit hollow when we don't even have a single aircraft carrier to our name anymore.

Oh, also Galloway supports the return of the Falklands to Argentina, even though the inhabitants actively consider themselves British nationals, and even had a referendum on the issue and voted almost unaminously in favour of remaining a British crown dependency, so he lost all respect from me personally over that.

As for Venezuelan impressions in the UK... I can honestly say you're not really mentioned in our media very often, if at all. We aren't really taught much about South American countries or their politics in school, except maybe a brief geography lesson. Honestly, the most I know about Venezuela I got from Reddit.

&gt; Since 2004/05, there has been a decline in crimes that can be aggravated
by alcohol, such as criminal damage (48 per cent), public order offences
(9 per cent) and homicide (44 per cent) as well as those which are generally
not, such as domestic burglary (31 per cent) and vehicle-related theft (56
per cent) (ONS 2015c: 10-17). Domestic violence has also declined, with
the number of victims falling from 0.5 per cent of the population to 0.3 per
cent and the number of incidents falling by 28 per cent (ONS 2015d). The
number of sex offences has risen, but this has been plausibly attributed
to a larger proportion of offences being reported (ibid.: 13).

&gt; These figures should be seen in the context of a steep decline in most
types of crime since the peak of the mid-1990s.As Figure 3 shows, violent
crime - as recorded by surveys - was falling before the Licensing Act was
introduced and has continued to decline at about the same rate as seen
between 2000 and 2005. Recorded violent crime, on the other hand,
seems to have been rising before the Act was introduced and has fallen
since. Neither dataset suggests that the Act created ‘more disorder and
crime to be policed’, as the Daily Mail (2005b) had predicted. Since 2004/05,
despite a rapidly growing population, the number of violent crimes has
declined by 35 per cent according to the crime surveys and by 17 per cent
according to police records.

&gt; In 2007, the Home Office analysed data from 30 police forces in England
and Wales and found a five per cent decline in violent crime in the twelve
months after Licensing Act was implemented compared to the year before.
This included 12,000 fewer violent crimes committed at night-time (Babb
2007: 4). There was, however, evidence of violent crime being dispersed
later into the night, with a 25 per cent increase in violent crime between
midnight and 3am. It seems likely that changes to pub and club closing
times were responsible for this temporal displacement, but these early
morning offences accounted for only four per cent of total violent crime
and the increase was not enough to offset the larger decline observed at
other times. Figures 4 and 5 show the change in the number of serious
and less serious woundings in the first year of the Act compared to the
previous twelve months (Babb 2007: 21)

&gt; A decline in violent crime at the traditional ‘chucking out’ times, accompanied
by an increase in assaults in the early hours, has been observed in many
areas since the Act was introduced. A study of violent crime in Manchester,
for example, found that there were an extra three assaults per week
between 3am and 6am but found ‘no evidence that the Licensing Act
(2003) affected the overall volume of violence’ (Humphreys et al. 2013).

&gt; This seems to be the only consistent trend that can be attributed to the
Act. In other respects, the impact has varied between different towns and
cities. A House of Commons report concluded that ‘Results from the Home
Office case studies indicate a worsening of crime and disorder in some
areas, and improvements in others’ (Thompson 2009). This may reflect
the uneven spread of longer opening hours or it may be the result of
unrelated local factors. Overall, however, it can be concluded that the
escalation of violent crime that was predicted did not materialise and may
have been alleviated somewhat by the staggering of closing times and by
the increased tendency of young people to drink in their local pub rather
than go to the high street (Harrington 2006).",null,0,null,1432111643,null,0,false,0,crf18re,null,t3_36lo3e,null,t1_crf18re,null,t1_crf1407,null,null,null,1433165393,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Spending 30m+ on a replacement for Stevie or Sterling would be reckless, considering the depth we have in those roles. Additionally, it's expected that we'll dip into the free transfer market for either Ings, Milner, or Ayew.

I feel that initially we will need to address our problem areas where we are lacking cover; Right back, GK, CDM. Once we have at least 2/3 of those covered, I think we can make a solid move with the remainder of transfer budget on a luxury/star player. Not saying we don't need experience and star power, but I can't see us making a huge move for Higuain (for example), until we have a back up sorted out for Migs who is our only real senior keeper.

For my dollars, I'd be throwing in some coin for Janmaat, Handanovic (would displace Migs)/Timo Horn/Matt Ryan, Kranevitter (River Plate, young Mascherano lol). As for a realistic ""luxury/star"" sort of player, I'd love Aubameyang.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"It's called the Single Transferable Vote (STV).

It reduces tactical voting because fringe supporters are more likely to vote first round for their favoured party (Green/UKIP/etc) in the knowledge that they can put Con/Lab as a second choice if their candidate is knocked out, rather than tactically backing one big party to stop the other one getting in.

Also, if you staunchly oppose one or more candidates, or only support one candidate you can simply pick a first choice only, or not rank your unacceptable candidates, so your vote will never be transferred to them.

It is supposed to give you a more ""generally acceptable"" result, as you're getting someone who has been voted for by at least 50% of the electorate, but at the end of the day you only get one winner. It was used at my University for Student Union elections, where you can only have one winner for the Sabbatical posts - Union President, VP Sports, etc - you're not voting in a council or parliament.

I guess you could use it in multi-seat elections to eliminate people until you have the appropriate number of candidates remaining, but it's not really designed to work that way. When voting for parliaments it doesn't necessarily get you a proportional parliament because votes for fringe parties are transferred to second or third choices. You could have 30% of first-round votes cast for fringe parties but still have no fringe MPs elected.

It's also how they select Olympic Host cities except they rerun the ballot after eliminating the lowest-polling city rather than ranking candidates in one go and figuring it all out, so an elector could change their vote depending on how the election is going, even if their first choice has not been eliminated.

In a proportional system - such as that used for European Parliament election, each party provides a list of candidates equal to the number of seats available in that constituency (let's say 10 seats). If Party A gets 30% of the vote, their first, second and third candidates get a seat, if Party B gets 20% then their first and second candidates get seats, and so it goes until all the seats are filled. The election of candidates is directly proportional (+/- a few percent) to the popular vote.",null,0,null,1432111902,null,0,1432113024,0,crf1aqf,null,t3_36jiqh,null,t1_crf1aqf,null,t1_crf0t8s,null,null,null,1433165418,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

From FSG's perspective an equity investment of £100-200M into the club to return to the top 4 should make complete sense. A top 4 club in the EPL is worth over a billion pounds. FSG paid just over 200M for Liverpool. Investing another 100-200M to get it to 1B is a no-brainer.

The reason why they won't do it is simple: they've watched £150M spent last summer with no return, and prior to that another £100M + spent with no return. They aren't idiots to try it for the third time, least not this time with their own hard earned money rather than crazy football transfer money.

Liverpool is very very close to being in a position where the owners are ok with putting no more money in, taking the revenue level they currently have and just puttering along in 5-8th place and growing their capital investment at whatever the average rate of EPL growth is (which is *very* reasonable, it has consistently been above 10% p.a for over a decade, which beats 95% of hedge funds - including John Henry's!)

I don't think we need many/any Top Top players, our first XI is good enough for the position we're going to aim for this coming season (Mid-Table, Breaking into the top half) However, we do need players to help strengthen our depth for when the inevitable Injury crisis comes and for Europe/Cup competitions. 

Goalkeeper: 
If we get flush with Cash this summer, I would love us to get a young, up and coming keeper and loan him back to his current club, Timo Horn would be a great example. Guzan and Given, while both flawed are good competition for each other this coming season, however Given will be gone soon and a replacement will be needed who can give Guzan some competition and also play in cups etc. to give Guzan some time off.
In: Timo Horn (If Flush with Cash)

Defence:
This is the area we need to backup the most Richardson despite Tim's praises isn't good enough, Bacuna isn't a Right Back, Vlaar can leave on a free and we're also losing Herd and Stevens on frees (I know, what a loss). This summer we need to answer a few questions: Are Cissokho, Hutton and Lowton good enough for Tim? Can we trust the 4 Ceterbacks we have to go through a season without getting injured every 5 minutes? Do we play with Wingbacks or Fullbacks? Senderos, Bennet, Luna. Yay or Nay? Regardless I think we need at least a back-up left back and a Centerback who can also cover other area(s)
In: Andrew Robertson, Kara Mbodj
Out: Vlaar, Herd, Stevens, Richardson

Midfield:  
As long as we keep Cleverly we're sorted here. Delph/Westwood/Cleverly behnd Grealish for our first team and Sanchez/Gardner behind Sinclair/Gil/Bacuna for our backup team. Add to that if we get Kara Mbodj (see above) he can play anywhere down the spine of the team so we have cover to play in both formations.
In: Kara Mbodj
Out: N'Zogbia, Tonev, Sylla

Forwards:
Same as the midfield to be honest. If we keep Benteke the only question is ""How do we improve on Gabby"". Replace Weimann with Callum Robertson from the Youth Squad and that alredy looks like a pretty solid group of Forwards. If we lose Benteke we have to replace him ASAP, that single buy will shape our season more than any other. Finally, I'd like to give Helenius a shot, he seems like a smart player so he could fit in well in a team that relies on exploiting the space.

Who in the party actually gets those seats is then determined by who in the party received the votes. If the party gets 3 seats, then you give the seats to the top three most voted party candidates.

If your agents still refuse, contact the landlord directly. If you don't have the landlord's details, then request this from the agents. By law they have to provide the contact details to you, otherwise they are committing a criminal act.

Contrary to popular media belief, it is not as easy to fill a flat back to back with no void period. Rental yields are extremely low in London as is. Even if you are able to rent the flat out with no void period, you're looking at 3.5% yield in London at best.

I'm a member of a party, so I get to vote on who's on our lists for Holyrood and Brussels, and the ordering of that list, but the public don't. I don't like that. I think the public should get the final say, that's why I prefer STV. 

Considering I've just told you I live in a country that has moved to STV, I am aware that it means multi-member constituencies. STV with single seat constituencies is effectively near enough AV and is absolutely terrible - it's what we use for by-elections and I think it should be changed.

&gt;So say there are 100 constituencies &amp; 100 list mandates (200 seats in total). The Conservatives win 20 constituencies &amp; 30% of the vote on the second list ballot. They would then gain 30 seats.

That's not how the German system works. You take up every seat you win on the constituency vote, but the PR vote is only for the balance of seats (100, in your example). In your various scenarios, the actual number of seats is as follows:

- 20 constituencies and 30% of the vote = 50 seats (20 + 30% of 100)

- 30 constituencies and 30% of the vote = 60 seats (30 + 30% of 100)

- 0 constituencies and 30% of the vote = 30 seats (0 + 30% of 100)

The 5% threshold is only relevant for determining the number of seats gained under the second part of the equation. If, for example, you're a local independent candidate standing in only one seat, and you win that constituency, you still get to take up your seat in parliament. You don't get any extra seats because nationally you were below the 5% threshold.

This means that local candidates can still be represented in parliament, but fringe parties with little national support won't be over-represented.

For me, the German system is the perfect mix of local constituency ties and PR. Constituencies would likely be twice as large, but half of parliament would be made up via proportional representation.

The general electorate has no say in who is in the party list or the ordering of it in the EU elections, not in the UK anyway. But you don't have to do it that way, and it's actually a rather silly way of doing it. And in fact, not all EU countries do it in this way. That's exactly the point I was trying to make. You can instead do it so that people vote for individual candidates and not just a party.

So instead, the party just provides a list of their candidates in no particular order. Who actually gets elected is then decided by the electorate based on which individuals they voted for. Suppose that based on proportions, the party gets allocated three seats. Then the top three voted candidates of that party get elected. The electorate has clearly chosen the three individuals who receive the seats, not the party.

Furthermore, the party list can contain way more candidates than there are seats available. This further gives the power to the electorate to choose the individuals they want representing them. And it is in the interest of the party to provide plenty of candidates. This gives more options for people and there's a better chance that a voter will find a candidate they like from the party. Even if a candidate doesn't get elected, the votes they received are still counted for the party and so benefit the party and some other candidate on their list.

71.1% of 4,094,784 = 2,911,391 people who voted. (1,454,436/2,911,391)*100 = 49.9%

It's not just about what one producer can offer - the size and scale of these businesses means that there are different layers of quality that a manufacturer can offer.

Examples:
Milk - your standard supermarket carton - a factory I am familiar with would produce milk for the majority of the UK retail market. In theory, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Nisa all taking 'the same product'. If you look closer, you see that Tesco pay a premium for ""dedicated tesco farms"", and other subtle differences like the age of the ingredients and how it's processed can differ from retailer to retailer - basically the better quality can sell for a higher price.

Fruits / Veg - you'll have lots of little growers providing 'the same' product to different retailers. Items will be sorted by size, weight, conformity, shape, etc. Waitrose may have a much more strict size standard than say Aldi. Microbiologically, each retailer will have their own standard. Only 'the best' can operate to the higher standards that the higher priced products will work to. Smaller farms, who may not be able to meet the same quality may sell to a different range of customers.

(then you look at industries that use these ingredients in bulk - they don't care about shape, and some of the elements that retailers do. Never trust a straight carrot, right?)

First, I am a really good economist. But I also enjoy philosophy and computer games. If you said, ""You can have the same amount of money for being an economist, being a philosopher or streaming computer games for the entertainment of others"", I would pick philosophy or computer games, and have a brilliant time. But that is a really bad way to run an economy - no matter how valuable philosophy and computer games, it is better to have proper philosophers and proper computer game players do these jobs, and encourage me to do economics (because I'm good at economics and only an enthusiastic amateur at philosophy). One way this can be accomplished is by messing around with the wage structures of these professions - philosophers are paid a pretty flat, low salary, economists are paid very variable salaries depending on ability and computer game players are paid like footballers - the top echelon take millions per year and everyone else gets basically nothing.

Second, there will be serious supply issues. Suppose you put the wage which people are paid at £13 / hour (which I think is national median wage). Why would Tesco hire cashiers at £13 / hour when cashiers don't generate £13 / hour increased profit for them? They will switch to those automatic checkout machines, because instead of paying someone £100 / hour to debug them they can pay £13 / hour. So a lot of people will be out of a job. On the other side, why would someone like a security guard work night shifts when the day shift pays the same and is much more social? Why would a lawyer stay in the UK when they could move abroad and make much more money? 

Third, there are some issues of personal freedom. If someone *wants* to pay me £5 / hour to weed their lawn and I want to accept that wage, why does the government have a right to stop us from completing that mutually beneficial transaction?",null,0,null,1432116251,null,0,false,0,crf28la,null,t3_36i3nu,null,t1_crf28la,null,t1_crf1dau,null,null,null,1433165932,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

My points are all relevant to discussion and down votes will only further my suspisions, leading me to assume that I've hurt some feelings with my latter sentence, further strengthening MY opinion here. Let others have a chance to read what I've got to say.

I fully disagree with the sacking of Rodgers. The best young manager out there imo and he's actually done very well considering the shitty situation with Suarez and Sturridge. People are being much too knee jerk. Rodgers brought in a big pool of fantastic young talent. People like to say Can is the only one panning out. I guarantee that Markovic and Moreno will both improve significantly at the *least* next season, and will begin shining in two. They're all three absurdly talented and smart for players at their age, even in the EPL.

I think peoples' assessments of ability and potential on this subreddit is way off and that not enough of the people being vocal about how his signings have failed have played football at a high enough level for long enough to cast the judgments they do or have any real criticisms that hold any weight in the scope of what actually goes into being a top tier talent. All 3 of those boys have got it. 

Furthermore, I would argue that much of the backbone talent and experience of the squad was supposed to be in Lallana and Sturridge who were just simply not available enough last season.

&gt; The reason why they won't do it ...

You say it's a no-brainer, and yet you also admit that they're not going to do it. John Henry is a guy with over $1bn USD net worth. You don't get that rich by passing up ""no-brainer"" business opportunities, and in this case I really don't agree it is one. 

If spending £200m would guarantee us consistent top four placing, then yeah, it would be a no-brainer. But this is football. Even if the other four clubs we're competing with stood still, £200m still wouldn't guarantee anything. The fact that it's £200m *and* we've got to factor in what clubs around us are doing just makes it even more risky. 

If spending X gets us back into the Champions League and it's an obvious investment to make, then that applies to Arsenal as much as it does us, which means they spend X as well, which means spending X no longer gets us back into the Champions League. The entire thing is just an arms race of money where ultimately one team out of five (or out of six if you include Spurs) has to lose out. Given that Man Utd, Chelsea and Man City are richer and more cemented than we are at the top, that makes the odds even worse. 

You're bang right on the other stuff though. 

I don't think Liverpool are ever going to get back into the top four through pure financial muscle unless we get owners who, unlike FSG, don't give a shit about ROI or investment risk. When competing with the likes of Abramovich and Mansour, who are happy to just piss money away because a football club is just an expensive toy for them, anyone actually looking to make a profit as well is never going to win many trophies. If we're looking for ROI then big spending doesn't make sense compared to just maintaining 5th and hoping to score the odd year where someone in front of us fucks up for our benefit.

It typically uses FPTP for the geographic seats, but then it adds additional list seats to even out the overall representation so that the end result is however proportional you want it to be.

E.g. lets say you split the seats 50/50 between geographic seats and list seats. Now you've doubled the size of constituencies but still retain a strong geographic link. People popular locally can still get directly elected, but the other half of the seats would be used to even out the representation. There are still complications, but they're all solvable - it's a matter of how much complexity you want to add to maintain full proportionality in all situations.  Some systems like this also maintains geographic links for the list votes by allocating the list votes to party candidates based on where the party ""wasted"" most votes.

E.g. my local seat was won by 165 votes and 22588 votes were ""wasted"" on the second place candidate. In an MMP system where you'd want to maintain as strong a geographic link as possible, it'd be natural that if this party were due list seats, that a candidate in my constituency would be one of the ones picked. Maintaining geographic links for list votes is possible both in MMP and in ""pure"" list vote proportional systems.

That's interesting. I've wondered about that before. I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that there wasn't a quality difference, but that ALDI don't store their food as well or have it on shelves longer.

What made me think that was that when I've bought broccoli from one of the bigger supermarkets, it usually lasts ten days easily and still looks perky and fresh. When I've bought it from ALDI, it has gone yellow and droopy after 1-2 days. Sometimes it even looks like that on the shelf. I've noticed that ALDI just have it on a room temperature shelf, whereas in somewhere like Morrisons, it is stored on a shelf that's kept cooler.

I've had similar experiences with buying raspberries and blueberries. When I buy them from a big supermarket, they last a week. When I buy them from ALDI, there's usually a few bad ones in there immediately and they go soft in a couple of days, or sometimes they even look spoiled on the shelf. They're all coming from Spain and look similar in terms of packaging. It wouldn't surprise me if they came from the same supplier, which is what made me think it was the handling/storage/shelf temperatures that differed.

**Young player of the season**: **Muniesa**, we dont have many young players pushing for first team places but Muni has came on leaps and bounds since he first joined us despite his injuries. I'd like to see him and Shawcross as our main CB pairing next season.

**Most improved player**: **Victor Moses** or **Charlie Adam**, Moses was dreadful at Liverpool and I was worried it would turn out to be a bad move as I never saw him as anything more than a pace merchant, nice to be proven wrong though. Not sure I would take him on permanently though considering we have enough injury prone players as it is. Adam has been terrific when called upon recently and is becoming more consistent (Always viewed that as his biggest problem, he'd be great one game and then completely anonymous the next)

**Hughes' best signing this season**: **Bojan**, had a slow start but had a great run where he was the most important player in the team and we didnt look the same when he sustained his injury.

**Favourite game**: The **3-2 win against Arsenal** in December, especially in the first half. We were ruthless

**Goal of the season**: **Bojan** vs Rochdale or **Adam** vs Chelsea

**Predictions for next season**: I expect Mark to be backed this summer as we could do with a new RB and CM (and a GK if Bego is sold).

I've not had a ready meal since uni in 2007.

For example two big fillets can easily run into £10.  Cheese can add up too, and 2 bottles of wine at £15-20 each can also seriously bump up costs. 

Even our cats eat premium food as they are indoors at the moment.

I genuinely can't remember the last time we bought snacks other than items like grissini for dipping.

It all adds up quickly. 

Anyway, we enjoy good food and drink and I make no apologies. Cooking is a huge joy in my life! Think of it like a hobby rather than a necessity.

We also both bring our own food into work for lunches. This is something most people don't budget for in a weekly shop.

My skin: my cheeks are super dry, with a slightly bumpy texture (not distinct bumps like the kp I have on my arms, and the redness and texture is worse on the lower half. It also ends abruptly- one one side there's a clean line where it stops close to my jaw.) I also have a really shiny t-zone and tend to get spots along my chin (I think these are due to a combination of stress and touching my chin...) I'm also worried about fine lines and puffiness around my eyes (I often don't get enough sleep and I know it)

Current routine:
AM:
Boots Botanics Shine Away foaming face wash
Lush Tea Tree Water Toner applied with a cotton pad
Eye cream (just finished Simple kind to eyes, was using L'Oreal Skin Perfection, but have decided to try Origins Starting Over so have been using that for a couple of days)
Simple Kind to Skin Replenishing rich moisturiser.
On a typical work day I wear a silicone-based primer, foundation and mascara. I work as a pastry chef in fine-dining, so my skin gets a mix of recycled air, dry cold air, and hot steam (not to mention flour particles- I swear, my pores probably get filled with steam and flour! :-P ) On a day off I probably wear about the same amount of makeup, a bit more on my eyes though.

PM: (I stopped using cleansing wipes two weeks ago, and I think it's helped a bit with the dryness.)
Nivea Sensitive Cleansing Milk (massaged onto my skin and removed with a cotton pad) (I've been using this to cleanse and remove makeup, is that okay?)
Shower (I get all steamy, so thought I would mention that I do this before I apply toner, but after using the cleanser. Is there logic here, or am I slightly off?)
Lush Tea Tree Water toner
Eye cream (same as above)
Garnier Moisture Rescue Night Care

Once a week each (on separate days) I use Nip and Fab's Glycolic Facial Scrub, and the Quick Fix Facial's Purifying Charcoal Mask. If I still feel like my face isn't really clean in the shower I use Good Things Stay Clear Purifying Cleanser.

In particular I'm looking for a better daytime moisturiser, and suggestions on how to improve my routine overall. I do lean more towards natural products when possible, and for trying out different products I'd prefer things I can pick up from the drugstore (I've bought a couple of pricier things before which haven't worked for me), but I'm slowly moving towards better, more expensive things.

But they aren't getting money 'for nothing'. They're getting money to support them while they apply for jobs, and they have to apply for a certain number of jobs each week, while also complying with the other jobcenter requirements (which can be pretty onerous and ridiculous in the current sanction-happy environment).

And, as many other people have said in these comments, there wouldn't be a particular issue if jobseekers (*all* jobseekers, mind you, not just 18-21-year-olds) were expected to do community work one day a week. That way, they'd still be earning minimum wage for their efforts, and nobody could argue that they wouldn't have time to apply for jobs and volunteer elsewhere. But the current scheme being suggested is thirty hours per week, which seems to me ridiculously exploitative. If the government has set a minimum wage, they shouldn't then be able to circumvent it by coercing the young and desperate into working for a third of that.

Oh, and...

Mandelson has explained why we failed to appeal to middle-class voters, but he seems to overlook our failure to recapture working class votes. As Mandelson emphasises, our perceived economic incompetence and the Tories' rhetoric on welfare surely explains part of it in England, but it seems likely that immigration and other social issues played a big role, hence UKIP doing well amongst working class voters.

&gt; Kids put it on in as much as everyone around them talks like that and they are influenced by that, no differently than any other accent.

Maybe so, but I (for example) grew up with everyone around me swearing - that doesn't automatically mean that I decided to do the same. Anyone can be common, but aspiring to talk like *that*? Righto.

Fortunately. You also don't have to imagine, unless you have a need to dismiss people that have already witnessed that.

You do get people who deliberately talk more 'London' even when they've always lived in Orpington, but at least that's changing to an existing, regional accent - however, neither of your examples were invented on the spot, so to speak...so actually yes, it's invalid.

I find that kind of reflexive economist-bashing pretty unhelpful to be honest - I work for the NHS trying to negotiate with drugs companies so we don't get hauled over the coals when they come out with new medicines. If people like me went and did something else, we probably wouldn't be able to afford to treat everyone who needed it on the NHS (or at least, the problem would be much worse than it is now). 

I'm a pretty serious socialist, but I'm also a realist about how the economy works - I've read about Parecon economics before, and it has some substantial problems I've not seen addressed (what are the equivalent of price signals, which tell the market what and how much of a product to make, for example? How does the market reward innovation or discourage stagnation?).

I think its a bit patronising to tell me to 'adjust my perceptions' - I've read very widely around this topic, have looked in detail at some of the systems you propose, and people can't even answer my basic questions about the working of this sort of market, or explain why my serious criticisms about the structure of the market don't apply (not nescessarily you, I mean all advocates of this sort of system). So I find it patronising when I'm told to 'adjust my perceptions' - it sounds like people don't actually have an answer, and are instead hoping to handwave away the difficult mathematical aspects of designing a new economy in favour of 'imagin[ing] how pleasant things could be for everyone with less work and less inequality'.

This leaves option (2) which sucks,  but I think is best for in the long run. Get a signed agreement outlining what she has to pay per month. Get her to guarantee that she keeps you updated of changes of address and phone number so she can't do a runner. Makes sure she understands it is legally enforceable.

And has there ever been such a culturally mixed city hundreds or thousands of years ago? That's one of the reasons this change happened so fast.

In all, it's not that big of a deal because the past is the past. However, I wish that more 'regular people' would recognise the negative aspects of it rather than hold it up as a glorious past.

Reasons I believe AMS works is because we **already** mostly vote for the party we want to win. We don't vote for local representatives (for the most part) so they have no need to actually work to represent us very well. MMP makes people more free to vote for what they want.

I also think that the parties controlling the ""party MPs"" is fine. They're brought in because they will do what the party says, which is why you're voting for that party. You still have local representation (which should actually be stronger than before because of the above mentioned issue), yet they all come together when voting.

He went out and asked for Moreno - very expensive, very young and unproven despite his EL medal. Then barely played him in the 2nd half of the season, in fact the total cost of those full backs we signed but haven't used since switching to three at the back - around 22 million right there. And then I just think, Mario should start until he's scoring- there WAS a way to get more out of him. Then look at how he has reacted to Markovic's sending-off in the CL- we barely see the kid, he's not even bedding down in his first season here. So actually- if I'm Sterling, despite knowing I'd play more football here than anywhere else, it's probably more the questionable manager relationship and expectations which help him justify wanting to leave.

Can you link it, because I can't find it. Specifically you need the number of people who voted in each possible order, as that's the only way to check for this. Anything less will not help you detect monotonicity (it's not necessarily obvious without some proper analysis anyway)

&gt; If you don't think that we vote for local representatives then why do you advocate AMS over a party list system?

Because I would like to vote for local representation. Now, while I believe that we vote for the party most, I do believe that local MPs do, to an extent, try to help their constituencies. In other words, I think local representation is useful even if it's not the person I wanted in power. However, I doubt many people would be happy with randomly assigned MPs from the party which would be the only way to get local representation from a party list system.

AMS would let me more freely choose a local MP based on their merits and a party separately. 

&gt; At the last pay review, the independent reviewer actually suggested paying list MSPs less money because he didn't think they had the same job as a constituency member. 

Ok, this seems to be a valid issue and one in which I agree with you. Is it actually possible to incorporate an open list with AMS? So that everyone is voted in and nobody gets special treatment. Probably adds to the complexity of the system more than I'd like.

Otherwise not sure how to handle this other than to try and enforce it.

Absolutely, each Council is obliged to publish these, so for the 2012 results from my own local Council you can find them [here](http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/elections2012). The 2007 results were also published on the Scottish Office website, although I can't access them currently - I'm sure if you wanted them you could request them though. The joys of electronic counting! 

An open  rather than closed list for the regional top-up would be.. complex, yes. The ballot would be rather large. I had 14 parties (as well as independents) stand in my region last time [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Scotland_%28Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region%29), so you're be looking at well in excess of 100 names on the ballot. It would get further confusing if the same person's name was on both ballots and you quantify support for them?

And that's true, however if you had a first class ticket, would you ask someone sitting in first class to give you their seat? Would you ask to see their ticket? Would they leave?

I hate that they were fined within these circumstances, but it has to be like this as long as there is first class on trains. 

If we're being honest, I think it makes much more sense to get rid of first class, increase the seating capacity, than allowing people to sit there during overcrowded times.

This could also work:

Call him overrated, he's still managed to score 10 goals in a team that was destined for relegation. His main selling point is that he'll be available for a very low price.

**Adebayor**. Arguably our worst performer this season. Unless Poch decided to play two upfront, we need someone who will be willing to sit the bench but be able to perform when he's called upon. For that, I would imagine **Claudio Beauvue**, who scored 26 goals in 51 appearances for 11th place Guingamp in Ligue 1. 

We also need to get rid of **Kaboul** for obvious reasons. Our captain has been underperforming tremendously, bar the NLD, and its time for him to move on. We've already a replacement lined up in the form of **Kevin Wimmer** which is great.

Another we'll look to move on is **Capoue**. Honestly, he was my favorite player at the start of the season so its very sad to see him relegated to his current state. I'm sure there are plenty of teams who will be willing to take him, especially knowing how defensively sound he is. Our replacement lined up is none other than **Schneiderlin** who will take Mason's place in the first team.

Honestly, I would just stop here. We do not want another transitional season where we are waiting for new players to adjust to the country/playstyle/team. But if I had to choose a fifth person to get rid off, it would have to be either one of **Dembele**, **Paulinho** or **Chiriches** in that order. Dembele because it is clear he is not fitting into Poch's philosophy and style if play. I don't think we'll need another replacement for him either.

Meanwhile Muslims can't do this. The Koran in Islam is the literal word of God. It cannot be ignored.

**Young player of the season**: **Muniesa**, Dont watch the under 21s, so couldnt tell you if Shenton deserved it. Looked bright in his cameos though. Muniesa is the best of the first team players, his reading of the game is amazing and he's so good on the ball. Just needs to stay fit.

**Most improved player**: **Bojan** or **Pieters**, Whilst we were all delighted to sign Bojan, I dont think anyone outside the club expected him to be dominating Arsenal and Spurs within a few months. This has probably been his best season since he first broke in at Barcelona. Pieters was our best defender around the start of the year, think he's really kicked on. Another who needs to avoid niggling injuries. Shout out to **Walters**, although he trailed off recently. I feel like Adam has only performed for six weeks, he was poor for most of the season.

**Hughes' best signing this season**: **Bojan**, Easy.

**Favourite game**: **Winning at Man City** Just an amazing, unexpected results. Both wins over Spurs were brilliant, as was the 2-0 win over Everton. The Arsenal game was tainted for me by going from 4-0 to 3-2 within 5 minutes thanks to dodgy reffing. And the Arsenal fans reckon the ref fucked them over!

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; Scotland, for example, is reopening lines and heavily pushing electrification, upgrades, and lobbying for HS2 to get to Scotland asap. So that's one area that you're wrong about

That has more to do with a devolved government than anything else

&gt; HS2 will also deliver faster services to Leeda and Newcastle etc. 

Except that it's not actually going to Newcastle, is it? And if ""faster"" is really like 10 minutes, then it's not an actual improvement. It sounds like a politician's answer

&gt; There's actually a lot going on all over the country. 

A few northern cities and Edinburgh/Glasgow stretches the definition of ""all over the country"" somewhat - as those are where serious improvements are. London to Bristol electrification is happening, sure, but that should have been done decades ago like when Manchester got wired and really it should be places like Exeter and Plymouth or even Cornwall that are being wired now

Cornwall is finally getting resignalling (no more mechanical signalling like the rest of the country abandoned decades ago), but that has more to do with saving money for Network Rail by being able to close tons of signal boxes, rather than delivering an improvement (no real speed or time improvements are planned). Devon still gets to deal with Dawlish and its unreliability, and with still no decision on a replacement line (or even an alternative). Somerset will probably continue to see issues if it floods again.

Many parts of the country will continue to deal with a rail service that is beaten by car by entire hours in terms of speed and is generally more reliable, but that's fine, as we'll help pay for improvements for Manchester or Leeds

Vegetarians and animal welfare activists have been campaigning for *decades* to get supermarkets to be more transparent about the quality of life of the animals used to make food products (meat, obviously, but also eggs and milk and things)

I find it really hard to believe that so many people have suddenly become interested in this one specific animal welfare issue and yet claim it is nothing to do with Muslims and their dislike thereof. It seems much more likely to me that many of these people just don't like Muslims, and have found that picking 'animal welfare' as a topic is hard to argue against - even though they're just using the welfare of the animals as a club to attack a group they don't like, rather than because they actually care what happens to the animals in general.

Not for a fucking second did I say that. You mentioned him not being played up top and I just pointed he's led the line on numerous occasions, and mainly played on the which is the next best thing for someone with his style of play.

&gt; people expect him to play out on the wing, track back and cover that whole space, while creating and scoring goals?

I'm not saying they're on the same level, or it's what Raheem should be able to do. But Alexis Sanchez can and has been doing that, so it's not impossible.

A signed contract extension, and some consistent football.

&gt;doesnt help that he has gerrard taking the ball from him and basically saying i'll do it cuz im better than it. and then gerrard will probably lose the ball anyway so doesnt matter its a shit fuck of a season.

This is just childish and off-putting, when you make good points but write like this it almost undermines them.

&gt; but i mean honestly hes the most talented kid ive seen come through the rank in the last 10 years. its a shame to just lose it. he's not bigger than the club and wont ever get to suarez levels though so im not losing sleep.

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/3

Note: this is the law of England and Wales (there's not really such a thing as ""British Law"").

Things are a little more complicated because the artist may well have copyright in the work, which would prevent the owner from doing some things with it, which might conceivably allow the artist to prevent destruction of the painting (see section 80 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) but I doubt very much that it could allow the artist to require its destruction.

**Update**
On the question of theft (since it has been mentioned), there are a couple of things to say.

There is a special time limit in the case of theft, found in [section 4](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/4) of the Theft Act 1968. Roughly speaking, once property is stolen, that appropriation of the property and any subsequent taking possession of it (other than if it is purchased in good faith) does not start the 6 year clock ticking (though if it is already ticking, the theft does not stop it). For more details, read the relevant section of the act.

As to whether taking a painting from a skip is itself theft, that will all depend on whether there was dishonesty. Dishonesty covers a broad range of circumstances, but the Theft Act also deems that in certain situations an appropriation will not be dishonest. One of these is that the person who is the owner cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps. That in turn depends on questions like: whose skip is it?

It follows the path, which the education system also runs on, which is the idea of telling people what to think over how to think. I am perfectly fine with someone exploring their beliefs and seeing what religion, faith, spirituality or lack thereof works for them, but in my anecdotal experience, that's rarely the case. Instead, most religious folk that I have encountered have religious parentage. I'm not sure if it's correlation or causation, but my biased mind likes to lean more towards causation, that a large part of why those people are religious is because their parents were and brought them up as such.

On the other hand, I can understand why religious parents do it. To preserve culture, to save and protect their children, to conform with societal pressures or because they genuinely believe them. Or it may be a reason that I cannot fathom because I've never been particularly religious, it just doesn't gel into my mind, and so their potential motives are too foreign for me to even think of.

Either way, the outcome is the same, you have a child with an inherited conscience. And that child will only break free from it once they have gained a certain level of self awareness, critical thinking and patience.

That being said, I'm not claiming that being religious or Islamophobic is some affliction to be rid of once you come to some sense.

I'm also really against electronic counting. I don't like anything being black boxed, the money that could go into rigging elections is obscene and I'd never trust a computer to run a final count. It's fine for small elections, but I wouldn't want that to happen for a general election.

A computer running an algorithm on a counted by hand ballot is fine though (if ballots are available for the public to view), as then you can verify results.

And on that topic, that makes STV much harder to count.

But I'm looking at a map of the constituencies in the UK right now, and I'd be fine with them being made bigger. They're pretty ridiculously arbitrary and small right now, especially in populated areas. Looking at that makes me thing multi-member constituencies are probably OK. Currently constituencies in populous areas are too small to actually make a difference. That's probably the way I'm going to sell myself STV, but convincing myself that muti-member constituencies are a good thing.

The person in the article is welcome to dispute the Penalty Fare but I wouldn't hold out much hope of success as the organisations which handle Penalty Fare appeals (IPFAS and IRCAS), whilst they are supposed to be independent, one of them is a subsidiary of a train company (SouthEastern). 

Hopefully both will soon be replaced by a truly independent organisation but that hasn't happened yet and so their independence is questionable.

However, as shitty as it sounds, the Penalty Fare has probably been properly issued so even a truly independent appeals body would likely find in Southern's favour. Southern's [Penalty Fare](http://www.southernrailway.com/download/17308.2/penalty-fare-leaflet-december-2011/) leaflet deals with precisely this issue:

&gt;**If I have a standard class ticket, but sit in First Class, as the train
is busy, will I receive a Penalty Fare?**

&gt;As your ticket would not be valid in First Class accommodation you may have to pay a Penalty Fare of £20 or twice the First Class single fare (whichever is the greater) to the next stop, plus a First Class single from there to your destination. However, depending on the circumstances, you may be liable to prosecution instead. If you wish to travel First Class, then you must buy a First Class ticket or appropriate upgrade before travelling.

Yes they were standing but the principle is the same. They were in a part of the train in which they did not have a valid ticket for travel so a Penalty Fare applies. So even though the train was overcrowded if they wanted to travel in first class they needed a first class ticket (unless first class was declassified by a member of staff on board the train which does not appear to be the case here).

If they don't pay the Penalty Fare Southern could seek to prosecute under, probably, Railway Byelaw 19 which states:

&gt;Except with permission from an authorised person, no person shall remain in any seat, berth or any part of a train where a notice indicates that it is reserved for a specified ticket holder or holders of tickets of a specific class, except the holder of a valid ticket entitling him to be in that particular place. 

As far as I'm aware Byelaw offences are strict liability which effectively means if you did it then there are no mitigating circumstances (similar to speeding offences on the road). The person in the article was in first class without a valid first class ticket. Overcrowding or otherwise doesn't excuse them.

The fine (and it would be a court fine) for this would be considerably more than £20 and could be up to £1000 (though that would be unlikely for a first time offence).

All of this is to say that whilst we may feel it's deeply unfair that the person (or people) in the article have been charged Penalty Fares under rules and legislation as it stands right now Southern are acting within their rights to issue Penalty Fares in this circumstance and if they wanted to could actually take the person to court and would probably win.

I'm fine with electronic counting; we can still see every ballot paper coming out of the box and the like. I think it would be quite obvious in most cases if there was rigging going on. And then the ballots are kept - so they can be verified by hand if you thought something was up. I think it would be easier to stuff a box than rewrite the code, if that's your worry. 

I don't think being harder to count is a reason for/against a system. Argue about how easy it is for the electorate sure, but I don't think democracy should be constructed to make it easy for the returning officers. They're there to do a job and they do it very well. 

In most cases with STV, because it's more proportional, you can take a stab in the dark at how many seats each party will get. If Party A is polling 25% of the vote, and party B is polling 25% of the vote they're likely to get about 50% of the seats very roughly. So aye, in that scenario, that's two ""safe"" seats. But because you can rank them you can say, well I like Party A, and I like Candidate 1 from them, but I prefer Candidate 3 from party B before I prefer Candidate 2 from party A, so I'll rank them 1-3-2. It's in effect an open list scenario, where you can have a safe seat with respect to the party, but individuals can be removed. 

It means you don't have to hold your nose to vote for a candidate you don't like in a party you do under FPTP or under any closed list. 

Now there is *another* issue in that 2007 and 2011 have taught us in Scotland that for folk who just like Party A, they'll vote 1-2-3-whatever accordingly, but just as they come in the ballot paper, regardless of how good or bad a candidate is - so the candidates who were first alphabetically did much better, proportionately.

Your instructor did nothing to harbor that and sounded like a right dick - a bit of banter is one thing but this sounds like it went much more than that (I had an instructor for my DAS who would say ""Silky smooth gear change there Spiffy!"" when I fucked up an upshift. I ended up buying his bike off him.)

If the instructor really was that impatient and rude to you, I would consider contacting the DVLA. There are a lot of rogue CBT schools around at the moment and they shouldn't be allowed to steal your money like that. Not saying you will get compensation but at least there will be a black mark against that schools name.

£100 is a lot of money and furthermore, they have a responsibility to be professionals as what they are doing is a very important job - awarding you a license to use a 2 wheeled killing machine on the road must show the right kind of persona and responsibility, which obviously this instructor did not demonstrate. They should be all about getting new riders up and running - not dismissing and putting them down like they did you. I don't ever like to see a new rider be intimidated or pressure put on them, especially on the road. At the training school it's even worse!

You can trace the history of the SSP back into the Scottish Socialist Alliance, of which the largest component was Scottish Militant Labour, which broke from the Labour Party in 1992. SML was affiliated to an international Trotskyist organisation called the Committee for a Workers International. The IMT split from the CWI in 1992 because they wanted to continue organising within the Labour Party. (Today, the SSP has nothing to do with the CWI - the Scottish affiliate to the CWI is Socialist Party Scotland, which split from the SSP in 2006 in support of convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan.)

The IMT actually took a unionist line on the independence referendum, but bizarrely decided in October 2014 to start supporting the Scottish Socialist Party.

/r/hyretic i think there is validity to that argument, but i would also argue that at 20, when he was signed, it hink it was known that he was going to be raw. we had agger, skrtel, sahko, kolo, so i think BR knowing this, gave him a loan in the second half to get his game up. he played well at granada and over the summer we signed lovren to replace agger in theory. so again, knowing there were 4 experienced cbs, it made sense we let him go out on loan to get games again. my thinking here is that if kolo signs an extension, ilori goes on loan one more time. if kolo does not sign the extension, he comes back and makes the squad to prove himself. coates is a different case. he is a good prospect still, even at 24, because he is so big and strong. it highlights how good he is naturally by his inclusion into uruguays 27 man roster, and the bloke has barely played at sunderland. and if you look at his recent performances, he has been playing so formidably. 

i think both could have a place in our roster next season in theory. i personally think it might be interesting to have kolo sign a new contract, have coates as a 5th choice because sakho is always hurt and lovren blew this year and kolo is just getting on a bit. and maybe use wisdom/ilori at rb. i think ilori could get the job done at rb because he is so pacy and he is an excellent distrubtor of the ball. he wouldn't be a moreno, bombing up and down the wings, but that is not necessarily what we need. 

we have a ton of loanees coming back for next season, and potentially a lot of players leaving. if not for anything else, coates has increased his value these last few weeks in case we sell and ilori has maintained his value. they are both still prospects because cbs generally don't fully blossom until 27-28. aside from the hummels, the thiago silva's, the chiellini, cannevaro's etc...not many cb's make that jump so early in their careers and perform consistently well. cb is like being a coach on the field in a lot of ways and that comes with experience. i personally think ilori has a better shot at the roster spot because he is english (i know he's from portugal, but he was born in london). he speaks fluently and would assimilate better.

It will give you a reasonably detailed view of what credit reference agencies see about it.

You can check which debts are still outstanding.  If there are any mistakes on there, you'll be able to correct them.

You'll also be able to see who has been checking your credit score, whether your addresses are correct, if you're still connected to an ex partner who is dragging your score down, etc.

You can fix this yourself.  It will take a little time, but you'll be able to do it - and each month you can see your score improving.

Ok, now on to the debt you owe.  There are two main ways of dealing with this.

1. The ""Snowball"" method.  Which of your debts is for the lowest total amount? Concentrate on paying that off first.  Then move on to the next smallest debt.  This is *not* the cheapest way to do things - but it can give you a much needed psychological boost.  It's like defeating a series of increasingly challenging bosses in a video game :-)
2. Paying off the most expensive debt first.  If your credit card is at 27% and your overdraft is 15% - concentrate on paying off the credit card first.

It also worth looking at whether you can shift your debt around.  Is there a 0% credit card you can take out?  Will the bank loan you the money at a cheaper rate than your card?  Can you consolidate the loans in some other way?

Avoid Wonga and other loan companies which charge insane amounts of interest.

Simple. If someone is specifically performing an action in order to offend someone else then they have committed an offence. This isn't a new concept, it has existed in our legal system for hundreds of years.

That's not a very good defence. Homosexuality was illegal for hundreds of years. A law against causing offense is a shit law.

&gt;You can draw a picture of Mohammed if you really want. You just cant wave one around in front of a Muslim in an attempt to deliberately offend them.

Define deliberatly offending them? Publishing it on Twitter? Reddit? Printing it out? Handing out leaflets? Writing a blog article? Or do I need to be standing in front of their face and waving it around? What if I just stand there and don't wave it around?

This might seem like I'm just being deliberatly flippant but consider this, if we know that drawing the Prophet Mohammed is deeply offensive to muslims then it's simply impossible to draw a picture of him without deliberately offending muslims, consequently, according to the law, it is illegal to draw the Prophet unless you can prove without doubt that you did not do it to be offensive, which I suspect is all but impossible.

&gt;Is that seriously hard for you to understand?

I understand it very well and I disagree with it.

The key point which you ignored is this: How can we have a law which relys upon someones subjective feeling of being offended?

All you're showing here is that being privately educated is no guarantee of being able to think critically. It is not and should not be the remit of secondary school teachers to be preparing students for any given career, and the idea that they would havbe any advice that is useful to a student at that stage beyond ""this A level would be useful"" or ""if you don't apply yourself, you will never amount to anything"" is dubious.

Utter nonsense. Not to mention that it is not evenly distributed. Also, the UK population is 64 million, not 70 yet. 

&gt;""Growing rapidly"" is a meaningless and nebulous phrase.

Ok - let's use numbers then. In 2007 the Muslim population was 1.6 million. In 2015 it is more than 3 million. I would say that doubling in 8 years is quite rapid growth. And that's not going from 2 people to 4 people. Dress it up however you want, but 1.5 million people is a significant number.

Census data here from 2011. Again, confirming that doubling.

&gt;And most of that will be down to the fully integrated 3rd and 4th generation children of well integrated 2nd and 3rd generation British Muslims NOT immigration"".

We can hope this is the case, but evidence seems to speak to the contrary. It seems that the children of Pakistani immigrants (representing the largest chunk of Muslims in the UK) actually cling harder to their beliefs through more generations. Usually the second or third generation feel so detached from their ""homeland"" that they actually idealise it. This guys masters thesis explains quite well:

Not from UK but this seems to be the root of most people's gripe about immigrant communities in general, everywhere in the world.  Doesn't it make sense to ask immigrants of any color or faith to integrate into the society they've chosen to join?  

Additionally, a particular problem as it appears in ""ethnic communities that happen to be Muslim"" is that the coalescence offers many more opportunities for radicalism to spread.  Which is the real problem, not the immigrants themselves.

So a bunch of people sat down with vets who told them ""captive bolt stunners and electric stunners"" can be used and the animal is still alive and still needs to be dispatched. While there are some die hard traditionalists most of the places in the ME changed over because they just had greater demands for meat.

Now obviously some animals cannot be slaughtered this way. Like Camel (since holy fuck they are tough bastards) but for cows and sheep the usual procedure is electric incapacitation before Halal slaughter.

&gt; I don't think my line has seen any investment since Brunel built it.

You might not ""think"" so, but the area has received significant investment. It is currently undergoing a [£146m programme of improvements](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-28135030). In the last 30 years, there have been several new/reopened stations, replacement of trains, various improvements to junctions, signalling, etc. It's far from neglected.

&gt; when the line fell into the sea after years of the government/network rail saying ""it would never happen""

The line fell into the sea due to the worst storms in a century, not due to lack of investment/maintenance. The fact that the line is vulnerable has been known since it was built, but major weather-related closures are rare (and are usually due to flooding rather than any structural issue).

Nobody (serious) said that a major collapse could ""never happen"", they simply said that the occurrence is so rare and unlikely that they can't justify the enormous cost of building an alternative route (and if the GWR couldn't do it back when railways were profitable and labour was cheap, there's little hope of it happening now). The fact that the 2014 incident is the worst damage that's occurred in the line's ~145 year existence shows that view is justified.

Of course, there are morons with stupid beliefs and behaviours, people who stereotype and prejudge. Their sexuality, their race, their toe length - these are just abritrary features that some of these people happen to have.

They listen to a lot of rap and urban music as they share a lot of the themes of disillusiionment, racism and poverty that rap came from. 

They are stuck trying to fit into two different ideas of cultural expectations, their media perceptions and social pressures. 

And they do face a fair chunk of bigotry. 

Once  was held down and force fed a bacon sandwich to send me to hell. Problem was I wasn't Muslim but Hindu. Vegetarian. I actually went to Kasi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashi_Vishwanath_Temple) to absolve myself of the sin of eating meat. 

Now here is the thing, it was pretty horrible for me to experience that. When I changed to eating meat as I adopted more of my grandmother's old Khmer Hinduism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat) I started eating more and more meat. 

I had my second bacon sandwich aged 24. 12 years after I was forced to eat one. I associated it with the violence. 

Now imagine how easy it is to find an angry, dissillusioned victimised young man and offer him rewards and equality. 

It's horrible to think about. But at no point did the Nazis think they were the bad guys. At no point did Stalin think he was doing bad things. The Khmer Rouge? Same. And at no point do people like Jihadi John think they are doing bad things. It's just that good intentions aren't enough to keep doing moral things. Terrible atrocities have occurred due to ""good intentions"".

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; You might not ""think"" so, but the area has received significant investment. It is currently undergoing a £146m programme of improvements. In the last 30 years, there have been several new/reopened stations, replacement of trains, various improvements to junctions, signalling, etc. It's far from neglected.

That is the signalling improvement previously mentioned. There will be no change to timings. There is no change to reliability. There are no plans to increase line speed considerably. I'm not even sure if they will be doubling the remaining sections of single track. The only difference is the *possibility* of half hourly mainline services between Penzance and Plymouth - welcome, but not life changing. It will still take 5 or 6 hours to get to London and two or three to Exeter alone from Cornwall (I can drive there in an hour)

What it is is ultimately a cost cutting exercise for Network Rail. They can fire all those signallers in Devon and Cornwall and ""off shore"" it to Didcot. It also allows Network Rail to remove one of the remaining bits of mechanical signalling on a main line.

You can make it sound as if it's brilliant and wonderful, but ultimately it's the upgrades we should have been getting anyway, rather than something new and exciting

&gt; The line fell into the sea due to the worst storms in a century, not due to lack of investment/maintenance. The fact that the line is vulnerable has been known since it was built, but major weather-related closures are rare (and are usually due to flooding rather than any structural issue).

Actually, partial closures are common just from sea spray during normal weather. Common enough that the line is bi-directionally signalled (which does wonders for already slow line speeds as trains have to slow or stop). Especially if Voyagers are involved, which apparently don't like sea spray hitting the kit on the roof

It might have been a record breaking storm that did it - but the point is that it happened, even though the possibility has been brought up over and over again. Not to mention the floods further up the line.

&gt; (and if the GWR couldn't do it back when railways were profitable and labour was cheap, there's little hope of it happening now). 

The GWR did want to do something about it. Hitler and his antics put a stop to it. I believe it got to the point where land was being purchased. Now, at the very best, we *might* get an alternative route that is useless other than if Dawlish is closed completely, because it's that slow and low-capacity.

If this was any other part of the country they'd be planning for a long term fix in hours. But it's Devon, so the bare minimum will do

&gt; The fact that the 2014 incident is the worst damage that's occurred in the line's ~145 year existence shows that view is justified. There are several other lines which suffer much more regular storm damage (although none of these are ""main"" lines).

How many of these cut an entire part of the country off from the rest in rail terms? Devon and Cornwall suffers unlike most of the rest of the country in that it has a single rail line going up (except Exeter onwards).

That doesnt add up to £1.5bn, but fair do's ..I might be missing a few additional fines imposed, as Barclays (as well as other banks) seem to have a finger in quite a few dodgy deals..  

As to it being a significant hit: Fined 2/3 of their yearly profit for defrauding the populations of loads of countries for ...how many years?  (the Rolling Stone article indicates from the early nineties and up to 16 banks involved)  

Quick back of the beermat maths, assuming all 16 banks made Barclay level of profit for £2bn..say..20 yrs : 
thats 2bn x 20yrs x 16 (banks) =640bn in profit (from all sources) and a fine of £3.6bn (champagne AND extra large bonuses all round I would argue)

These figures are very broad brush strokes but I trust you can see the point I am making.  As to it being a handful of employee's (in different department's by all the indications from the guardian fine list)..why aren't they in jail? Why the meagre fines? I don't accept that it is a significant hit at all.. In fact i would argue for jail time and the break up of the institutions involved, and take them under public ownership if required and sell the parts off WITH at least a modicum of financial oversite ..rather than the corrupt free for all, pigs at the trough, mafia/gangster system we currently have.

How? Oh, you don't say.

&gt;Not to mention that it is not evenly distributed.

Why is that relevant?

&gt;Also, the UK population is 64 million, not 70 yet.

Gives a shit? 3 million is still fuck all compared to even that.

&gt;Ok - let's use numbers then. In 2007 the Muslim population was 1.6 million. In 2015 it is more than 3 million. I would say that doubling in 8 years is quite rapid growth.

And what evidence exactly are you using to state as you have been that the growth will continue at that rate? Or indeed, any given rate? Because I haven't seen any. In fact, the only concrete statement you've made is that the population is growing rapidly... [when the reality is the exact opposite.](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/07/MDII-graphics-webready-03.png)

&gt;And that's not going from 2 people to 4 people.

Actually, with projections estimating that Muslims as a proportion of population won't even be 10% by 2050, it is exactly that.

&gt;We can hope this is the case, but evidence seems to speak to the contrary. It seems that the children of Pakistani immigrants (representing the largest chunk of Muslims in the UK) actually cling harder to their beliefs through more generations.

Well a) You didn't actually read that paper before posting it because that claim is not made, and b) That is an oxymoron: There can only be one generation that is the children of immigrants. Moreover, since when must you have to reject Islam to be integrated into British society or feel connected to Britain? Your own source contradicts you:

&gt;in Hussain and Millar’s study of English and Pakistani
populations of Scotland, 40 percent of the Pakistani population chose to be
identified as Scottish Muslims when offered hyphenated identities of different
kinds (Hussain and Millar 6-7 November 2003). The PEW poll found that
Muslims’ sense of identity in the UK depended on the question. If asked whether
they consider themselves Muslim first or British first, the vast majority (81
percent) said Muslim first and very few British (7 percent) (Pew Research Centre
2006). But in the Sky News Poll of UK Muslims which did not require them to
choose, almost half (46 percent) said British first, 12 percent Muslim first, and 42
percent that they did not differentiate...

and, for example...

&gt;The authors found that Muslim women
respondents rejected notions of an essential, authentic primordial ethnic identity
which they should adhere to and instead, stressed the dynamic, contingent and
fluctuating nature of their identities. While they acknowledged their formal
ethnicities, or the ethnic identity that was ‘expected of them’ through the
hegemonic workings of 'race'such as university ethnic monitoring forms, women
were also clear that parental or ancestral heritage did not determine who they were.
Instead, they asserted their own agency in defining their identities in their own
terms...

So in the end all you're trying to get people stirred up about is the idea that at some vague point in the future, there will be a couple more percent British people as a percentage of total British people than there are now.

If Ojo becomes a first team player I will be blown away, he's looked average amongst the younger players everytime I have seen him play. Origi has had a mediocre season at Lille, he isn't going to come in and be the next Torres/Suarez more than likely. Ibe will likely never reach the level of Sterling (especially if he only ever gets played as a right wing back), he will probably end up as a good squad player but not one of the better players in his position in the league.

If we can't hold onto Sterling then it sets a bad precedent for players like Sinclair and Couthino who are/could be something very special.

Unfortunately our approach in the transfer market under Rodgers has been very poor, we haven't really secured quality youngsters across the pitch and we've wasted a lot of money on mediocre older players. As a result we're left with currently a pretty mediocre squad with people in key positions leaving and no in club replacements for many of them. Fullback is the prime example, we have almost no quality on either side in this position nor are their any good youth coming through to play these positions. 

People over hype our younger players way too much, they read an article about how one of them had a really good half season and imagine the next Gareth Bale or something. Reality is we will need to look elsewhere and I've no confidence in FSG to provide the money or the transfer committee to use it properly.

null,false,ldn6,eng-GreaterLondon,London,null,"Not really. EU directives require a separation in terms of operations and infrastructure. In France, SNCF (which is a state-owned corporation, so not totally ""nationalised"" per se) is responsible for operations but RFF (similar to Network Rail) actually maintains and owns the infrastructure.

In terms of subsidies, however, the next effect on taxpayers in France and the UK isn't as far apart as people would have it seem. The most recent data I could quickly dig up came from railforums:

&gt; It should be noted that, in terms of subsidy, RFF (the French Infraco, cf. Network Rail) received €2400M in DIRECT investment subsidy in 2009/10. There's lots of other ways that government can also subsidise, for example by allowing RFF to overstate the track access charges, then sending money via the SNCF or other operators, but I'll discount that for now. The equivalent figure for Network Rail and LCR was £3800M, or about €4400M give-or-take exchange rates at the time. Even with that, apparently direct, comparison, we are still perhaps not comparing apples with apples, as we haven't compared what the terms on any loans are (we may be paying our loans off faster or slower than the French). In terms of subsidies for the operators, SNCF received €1100M in investment subsidy in 2009. Our figure was around £800M (or about €900M) in operational subsidies to the TOCs and PTEs.  (I'm not clear over whether the PTEs with their own rail infrastructure were expected to use this to finance that as well.) So it appears that, overall, the French spent €3500M and we spent €5200M on subsidising our national networks in 2009. Putting this into a per-passenger rate, the French spent €3.18 on every passenger journey, and we spent €4.00 on every passenger journey in 2009, although it should be noted that the French carry their passengers further, and RFF/SNCF aren't lumbered with the (often loss-making) intensively used urban networks that NR are (Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiff...). As another comparison, RFF themselves state that their infrastructure costs per line-km are €190 000 per km, whereas Network Rail spend €230 000 per km (as do DB Netz in Germany!)

One other point I'd make is that France didn't defer railway investment to the same level that the UK did; our higher levels of spending partially stem from much more intense investment recently to bring our railways back up to a state of good and improving repair.",null,0,null,1432137971,null,0,false,0,crfbicf,null,t3_36lziu,null,t1_crfbicf,null,t1_crf40t4,null,null,null,1433170371,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Melberger,null,null,null,"&gt; The Grooming Scandal in Rotherham is a failure of the police force. It's quite simple. ""Hey guys, there are these criminals doing X,Y and Z. We want to arrest them. We are worried we may come off as racist. Is this racist? It is? How can we make it not racist and still mete out justice."". A simple solution that would have helped hundreds of people instead was ignored.

You're an apologist. Plain and simple.

Grooming gangs like the one in Rotherham have been operating in the UK for years. All across the country.

They got away with it for so long because;

A - the perpetrators were protected by people within their own community

B - the police and social services didn't want to be see as unfairly targeting the Pakistani community (so they just let thousands of young girls be raped and abused over a period of years instead).

I recall on Newsnight a while ago, that Channel 4 had a big exposé documentary about what was happening in Rotherham in 2004. The night before it was due to be aired, Channel 4 were contacted by the police who requested/demanded that it was pulled, as they didn't want it to strengthen the then BNP political campaign. It was never aired. 

It took years later for the scandal to go public, and in the meantime may more girls were raped and abused.

Non-Muslim white girls were specifically targeted by groomers because they were deemed of less value, explicit racism - and it was actively covered up by those in authority, and those within the community.

A Labour councillor even gave a character reference to one of these groomers when he was due in court.

You don't think this whole series of events is going to get people's backs up?

It's indicative of the whole resentment in the UK towards the political class and a community which often segregates itself from every other.

A few days of speed restrictions or single-line working each year aren't ""major weather-related closures"".

Not really. There are other long-standing issues on main lines that cause as much, if not more delays each year.

To say that fifth is about where we should be is just a recycling of the Tomkins notion of spending power = league position, a notion that greatly ignores the wider context of this season and all of the opportunities that have been squandered.

Lallana was a key player in an overachieving Southampton side last year and was expected to come in and perform straight away. Unfortunately, his injuries have been an issue so nobody should be harsh on him for not wholly delivering.

Markovic was a decent example of it. He was pretty out of form and then dropped until he started to get some sub appearances where he did much better than before. Soon he started and put in some solid performances for about two months(?) and then his form looked to have tailed off again.

You probably know, no single story was broadcast as a single episode but rather over a serial, or several episodes. So several episodes make up a serial and several serials make up a season, rather than several episodes making up a series.

There are notable exceptions, like *The Key to Time* and *Trail of a Timelord* are all connected over a season and there are a couple of others, I think, but I can't quite recall at the moment.


So, Classic Doctor Who could be probably be watched out of order, story wise, but you would miss out on character introductions that might hinder your understanding of the characters slightly. 

It might be worth buying the DVDs, but I'm guessing that might be expensive maybe, seeing as you aren't in the UK (I can tell because Netflix UK doesn't have Classic Who).

To be brutally honest, the positive direction that the beliefs of many Muslims take are only so positive because they're moving away from the insanely barbaric and oppressive literal, original rules of the religion. It's the reason why people tend to lead towards this untrustworthy impression, because it's already on a scale of bad and oppressive. Few people see a muslim or a religious person and perceive instantly that that person is a more rational, more tolerant person than your average because of it.

You have your base person + religion. Not all religions are so terrible, but most traditionally preach intolerance of some sort, so you're on that scale. Right or wrong, it's the reasoning behind the concern.

The joke is I have probably personally done more to stamp out this sort of thing than you have. I do know what I am talking about here. 

A - No they weren't. In fact many Muslims responded with ""What they are doing is unacceptable and should be stopped"". Many of the people who reported crimes were Muslim.

B - The Police and Social Services simply had to ask the Asian community about how to deal with this issue without unfairly targetting the community and people would have helped them out. They did not. 

And I have said this over and over again. These young men were doing drugs and drinking. Guess what? Both Haram by most standards of Islam. Oh and there are probably Asian victims who simply never came forward. 

I am sorry? Where was this resentment when Jimmy Fucking Saville was touching up kids in hospital? Why didn't we declare that all white men were clearly child molesters due to him? 

Because we had an ounce of common sense between our ears that we hurl out of the window the moment someone mentions Islam. 

I repeat. This entire problem COULD have been solved early on by simply going and finding out how to word the details of a plan to crack down on such a gang without insulting or dragging innocent people into it through liason work.

Season 12 sees the Doctor visit the Earth space station Nerva, Earth at the corresponding time and later back to Nerva at a different point in time.

Season 16 saw the Key to Time arc where the Doctor has to assemble the six pieces of the Key to Time a device essentially capable of controlling the universe. Beyond that premise though the serials take place at incredibly different locations in time and space and few elements carry over from one serial to the next.

Season 18 saw both the E-Space Trilogy and the Master's Return Trilogy which are both connected under a larger arc concerning the entropy of the universe so it may have more of the feeling like a modern arc.

Season 20 has the Black Guardian Trilogy which is strongly linked through the appearance of the Guardian himself and his agent Turlough. The episodes also pretty much slide one right into the other so they are pretty strongly linked.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt;  25% of First Great Western's delays are due to ""Infrastructure"", which includes signalling problems.

That's more likely to be due to the London to Reading corridor, especially as crossrail and electrification are disrupting what's already there. The ancient signalling in Devon and Cornwall is actually very reliable - and the resignalling down here won't make that any better (it may make it worse - electronics are a touch more fragile than a fancier version of the bowden cable)

&gt; And the refurbishment of sleeper trains, improvements to stations, etc.

Window dressing when compared to the upgrades elsewhere. If only we didn't actually need the sleeper trains because it wouldn't take 6 hours to get to Penzance. Other improvements were things have long been planned but delayed for years (my local station has finally got a new footbridge - they began work on that before at least 2009).

IIRC some of the station improvements include things like wireless microphones for platform staff. Probably useful, not fantastically expensive, but doesn't resolve any particular real issue

The only real substantial improvement non-infrastructure-wise will be the slightly beefer IEPs that are planned for Devon and Cornwall, but even this may not happen (and we're only getting that because they've finally realised that maintaining a handful of HSTs is pointless)

&gt; A few days of speed restrictions or single-line working each year aren't ""major weather-related closures"".

Reports such as http://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10026.1/912/2012Dawson10091348phd.pdf?sequence=1 suggest there's been approx. 10 days of disruption per year between 1997-2009 - and that may well get worse if sea levels rise and if we see repeats of the last year or two. Maybe we won't see a collapse but there will be definite disruption (incl. Somerset flooding)

And the possibilities of collapse have been discussed for years prior to 2014 - e.g. http://www.devon.gov.uk/devel/loadtrimdocument?url=&amp;filename=EEC/10/216/HQ.CMR&amp;rn=10/WD2500&amp;dg=Public

&gt; There are other long-standing issues on main lines that cause as much, if not more delays each year. The poor quality of electical wiring on the ECML is a major problem, as are issues such as the Morpeth curve and Newark flat crossing. All of those would be cheaper to fix than a re-route of the GWML.

I suspect ""not wanting to close the ECML to rewire, for something that works most of the time"" is a bigger reason - especially when they can be spending effort on new electrification instead (like Bristol). I am doubtful that even re-opening the Okehampton line is going to be more expensive than rewiring most of the ECML. Besides, once everyone can be whisked up north by the glorious, essential. marvellous HS2, it won't be quite a big of an issue",null,0,null,1432138951,null,0,1432139855,0,crfc4cq,null,t3_36lziu,null,t1_crfc4cq,null,t1_crfbm1k,null,null,null,1433170659,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I've got friends from all walks of life but I grew up poor and in arguably the most multicultural part of the UK. The accent isnt put on, not here anyway. Yes there are some dubious accents from those who hail from further out in the suburbs, but here, in London, of course the accents are heavily influenced by the languages and cultures around them.

Where I live there's a large eastern european population and I reckon there has been a growing one since I was in primary school, and there's now a very distinguishable east london / eastern european accents that a lot of second generation eastern european kids have. (If not second generation, children that have been in the UK from young).


It's just really diverse, and there's a range of accents. I do speak differently with different people, there's no denying that.

What? You really believe that? (Also, here's some salt — it wasn't a fine, and they might not have been standing).

And no, I don't have unwavering loyalty to the major train operators. I instead recognise the system for what it is — a mess. The train operators *on the whole* do the best they can within that mess, but sometimes they do do stupid or horrible things. I can list loads of examples — First Capital Connect winding down the driver training programme when they knew they lost their franchise, causing TSGN to have a shortage. Northern being too quick to judge honest mistakes and handing out £80 out of court settlements. National Express East Coast (that's going back a bit) charging for seat reservations. CrossCountry charging for using paper advances instead of eTickets despite the fact that you have much fewer rights with the latter. TOCs in general getting rid of popular catering services. Ticket office staff training going down the pan, which now pretty much ranges from bad (eg South West Trains) to ludicrously awful (eg London Overground) — the only chance you have of buying an unusual ticket is if you find someone with ingenuity or someone who was trained under BR, or if you simply learn from others how to do it on whatever system they use and show the person selling you the ticket! That ghastly mess of an interior on the Virgin and CrossCountry Voyagers. All sorts of things, from the mundane to the serious, I have problems with. And as alluded to above, I would suggest that the system for dealing with incorrect tickets is fucked up in all sorts of ways. But this way isn't one of them, I'm afraid.",null,1,null,1432139463,null,0,1432139798,0,crfcfzp,null,t3_36lziu,null,t1_crfcfzp,null,t1_crfc5f9,null,null,null,1433170811,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Hopefully our physio room can keep Sturridge somewhat fit, he won't be a 35 League game man but somewhere around 28 would be great.

Losing a world class player, and actually losing 2 first team players with real experience and bringing around 8 in, from different leagues and differing playing styles. It was going to be tough to get all to gel and seeing as some didn't even have a pre season with us, integrating them into our system was tough.

Hopefully Rodgers has learned more from his mistakes, adpating systems and changing personnel slightly more quickly would be nice. I'm not saying if we lose 1 game completely change formation, but taking 3 months to move from Balotelli lone striker in a 4-5-1 is a bit of a joke. Bringing back Lucas that late into the season was a mistake as well.

And we have a summer transfer window in which I'm not expecting much and nor should we purchase a lot of players. But 2 players in,  considering Gerrard and Johnson are leaving we don't need anyone to be sold. Good investment in 2 positions, a solid pre season where Rodgers identifies his plan A and B.

null,false,Mayniac182,cnty-england,London,null,"MDMA can absolutely cause long term physical effects, since it's neurotoxic. It can also be incredibly dangerous short term if people take too much. While it's hard to OD directly, people can die from serotonin syndrome (primarily from mixing with other amphetamines) or death from dehydration (often from mixing with alcohol). Comparatively, with the same control over purity and dosage, opiates aren't that much more dangerous.

LSD and shrooms are definitely much safer physically, but psychologically  they're not fantastic. HPPD is definitely a thing, but not very well understood. It could be argued though that if psychedelics were legal, people would be more likely to use them in public which can put pressure on the police when dealing with people having bad trips and potentially getting violent.

Cannabis is an exception since other than psychological addiction and hindering brain development when used by young people, there's not really anything wrong with it. 

I'm not advocating keeping any of these drugs legal since I don't agree with that at all, but I'm just pointing out that all drugs have some negative effects which can only be solved by educating users. It's safer for someone to take a few Oxy's every month than to take MDMA every week.

The Sheridan issue isn't really that complex at all. A tabloid newspaper revealed his kinky sex life and he decided the appropriate response was to lie about it, drag women through court and the press while calling them liars and scabs, then split the most successful socialist party in Scotland's history. He's toxic - you can't have Sheridan *and* unity.

The one consistent feature of every discussion I've had with the organisers of the Scottish Left Project is their insistence that whatever comes out of it will not a) involve Tommy Sheridan or b) involve the SWP.

Show me any evidence, any whatsoever, that the Pakistani community actively rose up and outed these people.

You can't, because they didn't.

&gt;B - The Police and Social Services simply had to ask the Asian community about how to deal with this issue without unfairly targetting the community and people would have helped them out. They did not.

How do you know they didn't do this? and how do you know the police would've been aided in their enquiries given the same community protected, or at the very least turned a blind eye, to these perpetrators for years.

All evidence points to the fact that both the Pakistani community and the police and social services knew what was going on, but did nothing to stop it.

&gt;And I have said this over and over again. These young men were doing drugs and drinking. Guess what? Both Haram by most standards of Islam.

""Hurr durr not *real* Muslims"".

&gt;Oh and there are probably Asian victims who simply never came forward.

- *&gt;Ceop identified 144 victims of the Type 1 groups. Again, the data was incomplete. Gender was mentioned in 118 cases*. **All were female. Some 97 per cent of victims were white.**

&gt;I am sorry? Where was this resentment when Jimmy Fucking Saville was touching up kids in hospital? Why didn't we declare that all white men were clearly child molesters due to him?

You want to tell me you're not an apologist when you come out with solid gold whataboutisms like this?

There was enormous outrage over the Jimmy Saville scandal. To claim otherwise shows your true motives.

I'll tell you why Saville's race wasn't relevant, because he wasn't specifically targeting victims of a specific race and religion different to his own.

&gt;Because we had an ounce of common sense between our ears that we hurl out of the window the moment someone mentions Islam.

Islam is part of this. Culture and religion are inextricably linked to what happened.

Many of these men were married off to cousins in Pakistan, none could freely mix with women outside of their faith without the censure of their community.

Sexual repression, backwards cultural beliefs and racism was core to what happened. Islam played a smaller, but not insignificant, part of the entire story.

I wasn't out until around 3pm and even then I couldn't get the hang of the bike. It's actually much harder to ride smaller bikes imo. The power helps with bigger bikes, but you NEED to know how to control it first.

I told them I wanted to come back before going out on the road, they only charged me £60 for the second CBT, which was nice.

Bear in mind I had been driving a car for 5 years already at this stage (so I knew the road rules, etc), so don't be disheartened aye.

After that I went straight for direct access a few months later, when I hit 24.

Then I got an ER6 and now I have a ZX6R and that's all behind me, well worth it bro, trust me.

I recently did a [BikeSafe](http://www.bikesafe.co.uk/) course too, costs around £50. 

I would fully recommend it. It's with the police, it's a great days ride, very relaxed. You'll learn a lot that will help you stay safe on the road and it can even make your insurance cheaper with some providers :)

I've found it varies between one day and a week.

Just so you're aware, doxepin is not a very common medication in the UK and most pharmacies will need to order it in specially. This can take several days.

1. We have no Champions League. He won't come to a club without it after earning it for his team as the leader.

2. We won't pony up the money. Our transfer committee will look at him and go, ""Nah that's too much! Surely there's a proven Premier League striker that will cost less and has a decent return?"" and we'll sign Ings and one other striker.

3. If he's looking to leave, all top teams are going to want him save for Barcelona. You don't think he'd be an heir to Benzema at Madrid? You don't think he'd do well up front with Costa? Cover for Aguero? Ibrahimovic replacement? Giroud upgrade? Filling the boots Falcao has left empty?

4. He doesn't have to leave, and if he does, sadly, we're no more than a sideways move in terms of his ambition. I know people get crucified saying that here, but we've scraped into the Europa League by the grace of god, we don't have a world renowned manager, and we don't have other true marquee names. We're not attractive. Lyon has great fans too, so I can't see our support being what pulls him over the line. It's not enough on it's own.

5. We can't pay the wages other teams will be offering. We can't. We wouldn't if we could. It's not how the club does business and they won't start it with him.

Everything points to us not getting him and regardless of his ability that he's shown at Porto and Jaguares before that, he's never played top level football and that's a big risk to take on a player that's going to cost in excess of £25million. I mean, seriously, if we were mad about a 20 year old coming from Portugal and not settling immediately, imagine how pissed we'd be if Martinez couldn't live up to expectations?

Brahimi's buyout clause is £40million if the reports surrounding his initial move to Porto are to be believed.

1. Is this a good thing for our summer transfers or a bad one? Obviously, Pep is an attraction for top players; but if you look from another perspective, without any official contract, some players may be hesitant to join the club, who's manager will leave anyway, and Pep coming in 2016 is not 100% guaranteed.

2. What about our squad motivation? Do we have our trust in all the lads to perform at their top level, even if they know that our manager will leave at the end of the season? Will our players have enough trust in Pelle and his system?

3. How about Pellegrini himself? Is he comfortable with this situation? Can we expect any long term actions from him (giving youth a chance, for ex.)?

4. What about our transfers this season, we'll sign players that Pep will need, not really caring anymore about who Pellegrini prefers? (again is Pelle comfortable with that idea, maybe even not playing his prefered formation anymore?)

5. Least important thing, is Bayern really comfortable that their manager leaves for no compensation in just 12 months, having all the same questions to answer about next season's team performance?

But then you have Starkey etc. glorifying the aristocracy and left-wing equivalents saying that the Empire was awful and we should all be ashamed.

The slave trade is taught in schools and is taught incorrectly in my opinion (in fact Ferguson's book starts with such an example) - many people seem to believe that Britons caught slaves when in fact the tropical diseases were too severe against Westerners for them to travel inside Africa in great numbers so slaves were captured and sold by Africans.

Similarly Britain didn't have the manpower to hold India - we are a tiny island and they are an entire continent with relatively advanced technology to boot - it was mostly Indian forces that put down the mutiny (Indians fighting Indians) and many clearly felt the Empire was a good thing.

Also the Empire brought stability and advanced institutions to the areas it governed. It's not some obviously 'evil empire'.

I don't really see anyone saying that all Muslims are rapists. Anywhere. I see people saying that within certain Muslim communities rape and degradation of white women is seen as acceptable. And that's largely true. I see people saying that these rape gangs, where they do exist, are being shielded from prosecution because of ""Racial sensitivities"" which is now known to be true. 

But all Muslims being rapists - No, I'm yet to hear anyone suggest that they are. 

&gt;The very same internal community procedures are operated by christian and jewish communities - you don't have to look far.. Hell, if you go to orthodox christian areas you'll find their own procedures for community disputes, with preists sheilded from the law for their sins.

The link you provided really doesn't seem anything like a Sharia court, as i understand it on the reading of the Eruv, it merely describes an area of land that the Jewish community ordains an exception to its existing Sabbath traditions. I'm sure on the reading of your point that you are saying that such courts which are comparable do exist within Jewish communities, perhaps they do, but i am yet to hear any calls for such courts to be enforceable as law, rather than as community solutions. And that is the issue people have with Sharia law. No-one gives a shit if the Sharia is nothing more than a religious edict with no authority behind it other than being a ""Bad Muslim"". They give a shit because Islamic preachers regularly call for it to supplant the law of the land, and given the state's current and historic tendency to refuse to challenge Islam, people worry, perhaps correctly that their demands will be taken seriously.

&gt;I'll invite you down to Tiger Tiger or The Sugar Hut and ask you how many of those men describe themselves as christian, or maybe you should ask a catholic priest.

Absolutely because dancing with, or sleeping with a woman, or denying her the status of priest is definitely on the same level as requiring them to cover their faces in public or forgo education. Both are misogynistic, but lets not pretend itson the same level.

&gt;I'm not sure if you're aware, but the Christian westerners have no done much better there.

I'm going to presume you are referring to the crusades, because otherwise i see no mass slaughter in the NAME of Christianity in the middle east.

&gt;At this point, the court was told, Lindsay, who had come to the scene, told Ott: **“I forgot to tell you what happened, as he has jumped over there he has said: ‘I’m going to fucking smash up that building.’” Ott replied: “Perfect.”**

He is clearly a good way behind each of them in attacking categories. I think Coutinho has had an overall good year, and added goalscoring which we desperately needed from him. Add in that the goals came from shots that were previously some of the worst in the league, and he is getting a lot of credit for the year. 

It shows how poor the side were overall in attacking that he is getting so much credit. His year was good, but he can be much, much better in my opinion.

Do you actually know any Muslims personally? It's a genuine question, not a gotcha. I do know people who identify as Muslim that are tolerant towards homosexuality. As I said before, religious people are constantly reinterpreting their holy books so that they match up with the morals of today.

The business didn't discriminate against a customer based on their lifestyle. That's something that was already clearly illegal, rightly or wrongly. They discriminated against an order. The judge might be technically correct that the customer wasn't seeking active endorsement of a political or social stance by the business, but it's obvious why it could be interpreted that way if a business is outputting products with political slogans. Whether it be on a cake, a mug, or whatever. They didn't, and shouldn't actually have to provide a reason why they won't output products with political slogans they disagree with. There'd be no controversy if they refused - or in this case withdrew and offered a refund - an order for any boring statement like ""happy 130th birthday"", because they found it ridiculous and simply decided they didn't want to make it. Just because they make custom cakes, it doesn't mean there's some duty for them to fulfil whatever a customer can imagine. Imagine custom chair makers refusing to make a three legged chair. There's no mental gymnastics in what I'm saying, though it's a different way of getting it in perspective, because the principle is no different. No court should dictate what products a business should put out, barring the obvious for various products when you think about safety standards and laws on clear labelling, etc. *Tastes* of business owners shouldn't be overruled by an offended customer.
The end result of this is a business has been told it should have, in effect, mouthed support for a political/social stance they disagree with. Funnily enough, gay marriage isn't even legal yet in NI. Not that it would matter. You don't have to agree with whatever happens to be legal.

It is impossible to dispute that Jewish communities have a long history of being involved in money-lending occupations. That is a matter of historical fact.

I’ve often said a man’s character is not judged after he celebrates a victory, but by what he does when his back is against the wall. So no matter how great the setback, how severe the failure, you never give up.

You never give up, you pick yourself up, you brush yourself off, you get up and move on and overcome and that is what I believe!",null,0,null,1432145341,null,0,false,0,crfg8uq,null,t3_36n3av,null,t1_crfg8uq,null,t3_36n3av,null,null,null,1433172602,null,5,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,5,null
