null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Both parties have ruled this out. A lot of people seem to be looking at this from a very left-wing point of view. However, most of labour seats are dependent on their votes in English metropolitan areas like Manchester, Sheffield and central London. An SNP coalition or confidence and supply deal might hurt labour in these areas. Perhaps more importantly, it will probably cement the loss of their vote in Scotland... Since it sends a message to Scots that they can get more concessions from labour by voting SNP. Despite all the hype I will be very surprised if Labour attempt an arrangement with the SNP.

There is another way to look at it. Both Labour and the SNP have suggested a vote by vote arrangement. This will depend on them agreeing on certain policy areas. Broadly speaking there are three areas on which they are likely to try and form a deal. The economy, welfare, and Trident. as much as the SNP have suggested abandoning austerity labour will not be in a position to do it. It's easy to talk big on austerity when you aren't in power. When you have to balance the books it's much more difficult. I'm sure they could probably reach agreement on small issues, for example ending the bedroom tax and perhaps introducing a tax on higher rate earners. I doubt they are likely to agree beyond this. Then trident is simply a no go area since labour are not going to unilaterally disarm. Nor will they have the money to move the base elsewhere given the limited options available. Not to mention giving the SNP a victory on Trident would be a massive own goal that would simply cement the SNP in Scotland which is precisely what labour will want to stop.

If you issued (paid) yourself a £10,000 dividend - so that £10k was sent to your bank account - the gross dividend that would be deemed to have been paid, and on which tax is calculated, would be £10,000 / 0.9 = £11,111.11 (the 10% tax credit is £1,111.11, leaving a net dividend of £10k).

If you were precisely £5,000 below the Higher Rate Tax threshold before the dividend was issued, then the calculation for a £11,111.11 dividend would be:

- £5,000 @ 10% Basic Rate - tax deemed paid (no further tax to pay)
- £6,111.11 @ 22.5% = £1,375 liability

Even with the SNP seats, labour are unlikely to have a majority of more than 10 to 20 seats. Difficult red line issues like Trident simply won't be on the table for discussion. That puts the SNP in a difficult position... Because they are forced to prop-up a government that is going to legislate against one of their red lines. How do they then respond, do you day retort by voting against a major labour policy? in that case it is a very dangerous strategy which risks for some labour to try and call another election and force the SNP out of government. As a result the SNP's position is actually deceptively weak.

Another way to look at it is this; if the SNP will not agree to a confidence and supply arrangement, then they are probably going to stop labour forming a government and hand victory to the Conservatives. That is unlikely to be popular with their voters back in Scotland. It means they are playing a dangerous game of chicken. Publicly they need to be seen to achieve concessions from labour while privately they desperately need labour in power if they are to have any influence at all.

For these and other reasons I suspect it will be very unlikely that the SNP form a confidence and supply arrangement with labour.

Not necessarily. If the wind is down the sun may be up in which case solar power, ([which is also cheaper than fossil fuels](http://energyandmines.com/2014/04/solar-power-cheaper-than-fossil-fuels-confirmed/)), may be able to compensate especially as small scale solar infrastructure is put in place in new buildings.

Chelsea :Willian, Oscar and Cuadrado aren't permanent fixtures so he could definitely get time there. 

Bayern have robben and ribery who are getting-on so they'll need someone in soonish. Wouldn't surprise me to see them bring someone in before they leave so they can learn from them. 

Arsenal: they're still in a much better state than us. Consistently in the top 4, occasional league challenges, bringing in bigger names etc. It wouldn't be out of this world for one of our prayers to want to go there. Also, he'd definitely get a fair amount of play time there.

Just checking: where does the 22.5% come from? I can see it's 90% of the headline 25% dividend tax rate, but I don't quite grok how it appears ...

On a related but very slightly different topic, as I've got you here - do you have any info about whether the /order/ in which salary versus dividend happens in the year matters?

For example (making up numbers here for simplicity - I know they don't make sense really) imagine a year when one had a (tax-credit-*included*) dividend and salary both of the exact amount that used up your personal allowance and basic rate allowance entirely. Call it £41,865 for 2014/15, so a pre-tax-credit dividend of £37678.50

If the salary were taxed ""first"", the salary portion would be taxed thusly: £10000@0% + £31865@20% == 6373. Then the dividend would be taxed (taking your example) like: £41865@22.5% == £9419.63. Total liability: £15792.63

If, however, the dividend were taxed first, the same calculations would be, to my mind:

Dividend: £41865@0% == £0
Salary: £41865@40% == £16746

So, almost a grand difference.

Interesting to see that most people are accepting the denials at face value. Doubt it'd be the case on something like surveillance.

&gt;__Dipprasad Pun__ [CGC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_Gallantry_Cross) ([Nepali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language): दिपप्रसाद पुन) is a [Nepalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_people) [sergeant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant) of the [Royal Gurkha Rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Gurkha_Rifles) who was decorated with the [Conspicuous Gallantry Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_Gallantry_Cross) for an act of bravery during the [War in Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present\)) on the night of 17 September 2010.  Pun, then an [Acting Sergeant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant), single-handedly defeated 12 - 30 [Taliban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban) insurgents who were storming his control post near Babaji in [Helmand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand) province.

&gt;Immediately prior to the engagement, Pun, who was with the 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, was on sentry duty at a checkpoint guarding his unit's compound. Taliban fighters, planting bombs near the compound gate under the cover of darkness, suddenly surrounded and attacked his post with AK-47s and RPGs. Corporal Pun, alone and believing he was about to die, decided to kill as many of the enemy as possible. During the engagement he reportedly spent all his ammunition, more than 400 rounds; used 17 [hand grenades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_grenades) and a [Claymore mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_mine) before battering the last fighter with the tripod of his machine gun. Two Taliban were still attacking his post when he set off the Claymore mine.

&gt;Upon receiving the award, Corporal Pun said that he had no choice but to fight; the reason being that the Taliban had surrounded his checkpoint, and that he was alone. During the engagement, Pun saved the lives of three of his comrades and prevented his post from being overrun. His actions are cited as ""the bravest seen in his battalion during two hard tours"".

It's not victim blaming, it's just the simple epidemiology of how infectious disease spreads. Certainly those involved in public health are more interested in providing help and support to the most at risk communities, rather than crossing their arms and tutting.

It is deeply frustrating when people jump up on a high horse when a particular population group is identified as having different health needs than the majority. It's not being racist/ ableist/ whatever the chattering classes want to ascribe to it, it's an important aspect to how society is - and how we must recognise and cater to it.

Ok, I might have overstepped the mark a smidgeon.

But I was trying to highlight the extremes within a single party and I think we'd be hard-pressed to find two people within a party with greater divergence.

&gt; Philip Davies, and I mean this in as respectful a manner as possible, sounds like an utter cunt.
&gt; And worse, he is relatively young so he isn't going to retire any time soon...

Davies is my MP.  I've expected that he might defect to UKIP for considerable time.  Given the number of press articles in which he confirmed he wouldn't defect, I'd say I wasn't alone in that expectation.  I've also expected for some time that my MP after the next election would be either Philip Davies as a Conservative or Philip Davies for UKIP.

To add to what /u/TinyZoro said:

In 2011 Davies suggested **[disabled people should be allowed to work for less than minimum wage](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jun/17/tory-philip-davies-disabled-people-work)**:

&gt;Philip Davies told the Commons: ""If an employer is looking at two candidates, one who has got disabilities and one who hasn't, and they have got to pay them both the same rate, I invite you to guess which one the employer is more likely to take on.

&gt;""Given that some of those people with a learning disability clearly, by definition, cannot be as productive in their work as somebody who has not got a disability of that nature, then it was inevitable that, given the employer was going to have to pay them both the same, they were going to take on the person who was going to be more productive, less of a risk.

Now, to be fair, if you buy into the idea that you're worth only what someone is willing to pay for you *(and a great many people do believe exactly that)* I don't see how you could disagree with him.  However, fortunately as a society we don't generally regard it as acceptable to suggest disabled people aren't worth even minimum wage.

Davies was one of the MPs who acted to **[prevent the proposed ban on wild animals in circuses](http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2014/10/mp-rejected-bill-ban-wild-animals-circuses-remains-defiant-support-circuses)**.

Davies and another Conservative MP **[filibusted the debate on a piece of legislation intended to prevent landlords evicting tenants](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tory-mps-who-blocked-bill-banning-revenge-evictions-are-private-landlords-1477218)** who demanded repairs.

Davies commented **[after watching Benefits Street](http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10936454.Shipley_MP_Philip_Davies_says_benefits__too_generous__after_watching_Channel_4_s_Benefits_Street/?ref=twtrec)** asked in the Commons, ""“Has the Secretary of State managed to watch Benefits Street and On Benefits and Proud? If so, has he, like me, been struck by the number of people on there that manage to combine complaining about welfare reforms whilst being able to buy copious amounts of cigarettes, have lots of tattoos done and watch Sky TV on the obligatory widescreen television?""

The thing is, as reprehensible as some of Davies' statements are, I think that MPs who are relentlessly vote with their party to maintain their position - Most especially where they do so against the best interests of their constituency - Are terrible representatives.  Davies is often referred to as the most rebellious MP in parliament *(at the moment)* and I think after a fashion that's a good thing, even though I disagree with his opinions.

&gt;Assuming we do see the current predicted outcome of the Tories winning the election on seats, but being unable to form a majority even through coalition, with Labour and SNP coming second and third respectively, it'll be fascinating how the Tories decide whether to pursue a minority government or allow Labour and the SNP to form a government.

&gt;When I spell the scenario out like that it seems improbable that they'd allow the latter - better to at least attempt a minority government and then try to gain political capital by shaming any party who tried to block the Queen's Speech or a budget.

&gt;My guess is immediately after the election there'll be an amount of public discussion about the legitimacy of either arrangement and pressure put on opposition parties to allow a budget through out of fear of the markets losing confidence and a fall in the value of Sterling.

&gt;I guess what we can't anticipate is how soon after the election there'd be leadership challenges within both the Conservative and Labour parties, with their respective leaders seen as unable to win elections.

My understanding is that the Cameron, as current PM, is given the first chance to form a government. And I'd be surprised if he didn't at least try a minority Tory government. What I can't anticipate is how long that government would linger on before either Labour or the SNP block criticial legislation, forcing a vote of no confidence. Or Cameron is ousted by his own party.

January, February and March are busy for HMRC, due to the self-assessment due date at the end of January.  If you can hold off a couple of weeks things might calm down a bit.

Otherwise, the nuclear option is the same as for any large organisation:  Write to the office of the chief executive (lin.homer@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk) and copy in your MP.  This time of your your MP might be particularly keen to be seen to be useful.

Some people have run away with this idea in the last 6 weeks after some fairly flippant and facetious words from a (Tory?) backbencher in a Commons debate, who was only really making the point that the opposition would jump into bed with anybody given the chance. (Might have been a Labour MP talking to the Tories - can't quite remember)

The polls favour the Conservatives by a few points. Despite this though, the nature of the constituency boundaries means Labour may still win more seats, despite a lower popular vote. My guess at the moment is we're heading for a Labour minority gov.

A Labour/LibDem coalition would likely still be around 10-20 seats short of a majority, and there's little to no prospect of a formal arrangement with the SNP. labour would be as well operating as the largest party in a minority situation, albeit with tenuous agreements with other ""progressive"" parties.

We might find ourselves in the strange position of the SNP siding with the Conservatives over the issue of a Labour budget programme - it being too severe for the SNP and not severe enough for the Conservatives.

Could be on our way to yet another election within the next 6 months.

IMO though, FPTP is truly awful. We should embrace AV or some alternative as soon as possible.

&gt; There&amp;#039;s a global conference at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, where the giants of radical economics - including Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis - will get their biggest ever mainstream platform.

&gt; Mainstream economics had convinced itself that capitalism tends towards equilibrium; and that any shocks must be external.

&gt; The defenders of orthodox economics and the Minsky rebels are, essentially, asking the same question: &amp;quot;What does capitalism normally look like?&amp;quot; The one answers &amp;quot;Stable&amp;quot;; the other &amp;quot;Unstable&amp;quot;.

null,false,uglybananas,null,null,null,"We have hundreds of very distinct cultures all around the world with their own sets of values and they have taken 100's or 1000's of years in most cases to get to that point. Any change that has occurred within these distinct cultures has often come about gradually and organically over many years. By allowing and encouraging mass immigration in a short space of time the cultural shift has created a sudden shock effect that ripples through society.

This is made worse by not protecting the existing culture and values and allowing new migrants to bring their own culture and values with them. In some instances our existing culture has actually been denigrated in favour of others. Expecting many different cultures with opposing views to coexist peacefully when that change has been rapid and unbalanced is naive. Problems were always going to arise and this is the reason political correctness has been pushed so much in the last decade.

They are well aware of the issues that arise but simply don't care and instead of dealing with it they have sought to silence people into submission instead. Now the question arises why would they do that? What is the real reason for creating this mix of cultures and people to do it forcefully and in such a short space of time? What do leaders and people in power really gain from this?

If you're the type to tow the line you'd say it's about creating a more diverse and tolerant society but if you need to silence people through political correctness in order for that to happen then it can hardly be true. People need to start asking serious questions about why this is happening and who sets to benefit from it.

I believe mass immigration across the EU is designed to undermine national identity in order to make the move towards a United States of Europe easier and more palatable. National identity and cultural distinction was always the big barrier to this and people would have balked at the idea 10-15 years ago. Now the job is well under way and in another 10 years I'd say people would be far more open to this.

Basically mass immigration is just a tool that has been used in order to centralize power and form what will become a new superstate akin to the USA but driven by culturally marxist social policy, liberal tokenism and the illusion of democracy in order to keep people pacified while their fundamental rights are slowly eroded.

Obviously a right wing publication aren't out to do Scottish nationalists any favours... But that doesn't necessarily invalidate this story.

For some to write that in the civil service they clearly thought that had been said. The very fact one person thought that is in itself interesting. Will this story damage the SNP in Scotland? I highly doubt it. Will it damage them in England? Potentially. It certainly might arrest this SNP-mania since Thursday night. Might be more important than you would think, since English public perception of the SNP will be central to any deals labour might do. Casting the SNP as manipulative separatists makes it very tough for labour to reach a deal with them.

Honestly, Mason's biggest problem thus far is taking that liberty that you mention too much, and ostensibly, his lack of communication in doing so. Often times if he joins the attack and leaves that central third completely exposed, if we give up possession, he's caught out and doesn't get back in time; our defenders have to take up positions in no mans land to try and contain a break, and then the one weighted through ball is the death knell if the fullbacks aren't up to the chase. It's so frustrating for me to watch him because you can see he's got the ideal profile of what a box-to-box compliment to Nabil should be. He has the drive and grit for the defensive and distributive facets of play, but really needs to tidy up his contribution to the attack if he wants to join it so much at the expense of exposing our backline of two.

The central partnership is so fucking crucial to our game in every respect, and its successes boil down to somethings so simple as clear communication, understanding, and positional awareness.",null,0,null,1428116966,null,0,false,0,cq0n4zv,null,t3_318sto,null,t1_cq0n4zv,null,t1_cpzlgcu,null,null,null,1432186080,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

&gt; Here’s what we know so far: According to the state’s department of revenue, the first ten months of legal marijuana sales have resulted in nearly $40 million in tax revenue.  The city of Denver saw a decrease in **violent** crime rates in the first 11 months of 2014

Violent, as in, non-drug related.

The only downside of the figures of Colorado one year on from legalisation is that DUIs involving weed shot up around 70% - but even still the total number of DUIs remained much lower than DUIs involving booze. The way the DOE operate here, we'd have 90% of all taxed revenue spent on TV ads showing stoned drivers mowing down kids anyway to scare people off the idea of driving under the influence.

So - quite practically zero downside. More money in the pot for the government, a boost for local economy, lower crime rates. Not bad.

[Source](http://www.cas.org.uk/features/myth-busting-real-figures-benefit-fraud)

In comparison, tax evasion:

table 1) rising to £82.1bn in 2013/14 (see table 2). [Source](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/PCSTaxGap2014Full.pdf)

To try and liken the two problems as one and the same is a false equivalence.

£82,100,000,000(+?) is being actively hidden from being taxed by the affluent, while a tiny minority - indeed, less than 1% of already struggling people (you have to be struggling to even get benefits in the first place) justify a white lie to get a few more pound to survive in an economy where there is little to zero new jobs and a job market where one minimum wage position can attract literally thousands of applicants.

Of course, with a lovely conservative government in the UK it will be those scraping together an existence that will be the scapegoats, and not the actual culprits.

Your assumptions that those in West Belfast are just 'playing the system' are the result of a resurgence of sickening right-wing conservative and nationalistic parties having too much airtime.

Even if he plays 50% of games for Liverpool for the rest of his career that is an intimidating statistic.  

Discipline is not a problem at all.  Aside from the Gerrard red the only other red card is from Borini and Markovic (also as substitute appearances).  All three cards were stupid individual mistakes something BR cannot be held accountable for.

Every team has players discussing contracts in public.  Walcott, Falcao,to name a few so just stop.    

Please don't use a quote from Wall Street to make a point.  It has no point at all to the Premier League.

&gt;

&gt;The __Second Battle of Copenhagen__ (or the __Bombardment of Copenhagen__) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was a British bombardment of [Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen) in order to seize the [Dano-Norwegian fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dano-Norwegian_Navy), during the Napoleonic Wars. The incident led to the outbreak of the [Anglo-Russian War of 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Russian_War_(1807%E2%80%9312\)), that ended by the [Treaty of Orebro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Orebro) in 1812.

&gt;The attack gave rise to the term to [*Copenhagenize*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagenization_(naval\)).

well prisons have are expected to lower recidivism, crime as a whole is going down, but the prison population is growing, so its harder to say whether overall that is a good or bad thing or even whether the prisons have anything to do with that.

Fire service are expected to teach people about fire safety, prevent fires and rescue people from all sorts of odd situations, buildings that are built now do tend to be much safer, so its harder to say whether the fire service is less effective, or if safer buildings could be saving more lives than they do.

So basically employment income/rent/sole trade income is taxed first. Then bank interest then dividends, so dividends are taxed at the marginal rate.

At higher rate dividends are taxed at 32.5%, so £10*32.5% = £3.25, less tax paid £1 so net tax payable £2.25.

What this would do is boost the growth of smaller sports that don't get as much attention e.g Climbing, kayaking, cycling. Which could do with a few more competitors.

Also ban any drink that is deemed unhealthy such as high sugar energy drinks. In my eyes all I see is a bunch of people going for a short run then guzzling a 500ml bottle of Mountain Dew/other energy drink because they feel they need the energy.  74 grams of sugar is not really good for you.

Making companies who supply drinks etc to stop saying 'per 250ml' and instead the whole contents (on smaller items under 750ml) because not many people I know would buy a can of Coke, drink half then store it for later.

Teach children about staying healthy and the many benefits it has. Teach them about nutrition and what are good foods/bad.

This one could be a bit controversial yet either 1.ban the opening of any new fast food restaurants or 2.monitor the nutritional value of their food, if it is deemed too unhealthy then they have a set period of time to change the recipe or they are shut down.

This would stop people who can't be bothered to make dinner getting unhealthy due to the takeaways they are having.

I'm sure you can see the trend. I want somebody who will try to solve the obesity epidemic that we will/are currently facing.

**One last point: keep nuclear**, it has so many benefits over wind. People ask where you'd put the waste.. Under the sea in an bunker. 

Wind is all well and good but what about when it isn't windy, what about how bad they look, in my opinion we should ban any new wind farms and start to dismantle the ones onshore. There was an article on the BMC(British Mountaineering Councils) website about a new wind farm to be built in the Highland's. They ruin the environment by looking bad.

PS I do like solar though, solar isn't in your face like wind is, its subtile and can be put onto roofs of new houses and not stand out.

I think you have to look at people's lifestyle when judging why they're overweight.  I've never paid any respect to the ""eating healthy food is expensive"" argument because it's rubbish. For instance, you can buy 1kg bags of frozen vegetables for about a quid each.  If people want to sit on the sofa of an evening and eat a bar of chocolate then fine, but if they've cycled 6 miles that day then they can do that without gaining weight.

You'll be looking a retail job, go type up and print off copies of your cv. 1 page doc that shows you are a good team player, willing to put in the extra efforts. (sports, clubs, regular activies). Keep it short, recruiters are a lazy bunch.  Even with my CV they'll go straight to current employer, then skills/experience, check for a degree and then they've wat they need to shortlist me. They'll just scan for the key points they need. You're cv will be a token gesture really but shows you've good written skills. Don't worry too much about it.  The biggest asset you have is youth, ie min wage.
But more importantly, get into a shop, ask who the manager is, find out when theyre in. Come back and request them by name when they are in.   Smile, shake their hand and confidently ask are they needing any help.

A lot of places won't advertise but if a sensible kid comes in looking some hours they might make u a job cos you are cheap. Retails outlets love smart kids, they pay you crap all, you bust ur balls doing a good job then leave for uni etc and they dont worry bout promotions etc.


On paper (and online) you are just another name in a stack of cvs.  You need to get noticed by the decision maker otherwise the floor staff will throw your cv onto the pile and your odds drop massively. 

I got most of my early employment by getting facetime with the people able to employ me on the spot. normaly the Owner. (Centra, Subway, Paperrounds, Dishwashing, a Bar)


Get talking to family and friends. Update ur status etc.  even mention it to the friends parents. Networking will be key as you get older.  For one of my old employers i was able to refer about 6 people who all walked into the job cos the manager knew I was a gratfer and my freinds wud be the same.



Good luck.   Times are rough for employment but never let that stop you.

And watch out for commision only jobs.  Anything door to door, face to face, ""Acquisition"" or similar could be a con. Make sure you get at least hourly rate of min wage.

You don't*. it's not inherently harmful. if children are brought up in a loving healthy environment the vast majority will not seek out extreme porn, and those that do, will not become addicted.

*Depending on what you mean by ""you"". If the parent/guardian wants to and their kid is under 18 restricting their net connection, for themselves, is fine by me. If ""you"" means ""other peoples' kids"" it's not really your business to make those choices for them is it?

This is what the pro-policing people can't understand:

1: The genie is out of the bottle. The dam has crumbled. Nothing and no-one can turn the clock back. It's tough fucking shit if you don't like it. Go and cry to whomever, you won't change anything. You can't change anything.

2: This is a temporary issue. The children who can access online porn now will either grow up to be degenerate beasts who tip the world into anarchy, or they will grow up to become teachers and parents themselves, with the savvy to manage this new communication paradigm. What we're dealing with here is teething troubles.

3: Parents, you're going to have to talk to your children in graphic, personal detail about sex. YOU need to explain to them the difference between dramatised exaggerated sex the same way you explain to them that it's not realistic to behave like an EastEnders character, or a Call of Duty character, or an X-Factor judge, or that little prick in Fireman Sam who always sets fire to shit. Why? Because schools never will while this much of the electorate is prudish middle England. And because these are your children, who you love and care for deeply. They are your world.

Most bus services do a Day ticket or even a week ticket which will be better (but will only work for that company) and for trains be sure to check if the trains you're after are 'off-peak' and if so get off-peak returns.

&gt;The __Mathematical Bridge__ is the popular name of a [wooden footbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_bridge) in the southwest of central [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge), [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). It bridges the [River Cam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Cam) about one hundred feet northwest of [Silver Street Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Street_Bridge) and connects two parts of [Queens' College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens%27_College,_Cambridge). Its official name is simply the __Wooden Bridge__. 

&gt;The [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge) was designed by [William Etheridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Etheridge), and built by [James Essex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Essex) in 1749. It has been rebuilt on two occasions, in 1866 and in 1905, but has kept the same overall design. Although it appears to be an arch, it is composed entirely of straight timbers  built to an unusually sophisticated engineering design, hence the name.

&gt;A replica of the bridge was built in 1923 near the [Iffley Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iffley_Lock).

I didn't agree and I don't agree. Immigration helps our economy to grow, and when the economy grows we can take out debt to pay for infrastructure improvements.

It's entirely possible to do so, especially given immigrants are net contributors to our economy.

null,false,LaserExplosion,,Belfast,null,"&gt;I'm not saying it can't, just that it hampers it, a great deal. Why bother invest in the UK if you are doing it offshore? If the Island of Ireland is an Option the overwhelming majority of FDI is in the south every study indicates this.

The overwhelming majority of FDI in sthe south is Dublin and Cork focuesed. Why in  united Ireland would Belfast be nay more competitive with Cork and Dublin and not lag beheind as Galway does?

FDI invest where the is skilled labour, low taxes, business friendly regulations and good treanposrt links to major markets.  There are far more important factors that you ignore which partition has no bearing on. Dublin, Cork and Belfast will always be the top economic aeas of Ireladn regardless of partition, this sis due to acess to ports and large populations with useful skills. The negative effects of partition you cite such as rail links to the west of Ireland are non issues to FDIs.

&gt;Sorry; but this is not the case. ROI is the amongst the Largest trading partners of the UK.

Your mssing the point FDIs are interested in the Europeran market. Not the domestic market of Ireland, for whcih transports links between Derry and GAlway might matter to some degree. It is the ability to accesss Contienwtal Europe they are intested in.

Also if Ireland is so trade dependent on the UK. Will we be stuck in the UK's economic orbit no matter what we do. The only advantge of aunited ireladn will be lower copration tax, but it looks like we may get that without a UI

  &gt;  In fact, Ireland imports more goods from Britain than the rest of Europe combined, according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce. This close trading relationship is not surprising considering the trading advantages UK companies have; they share a timezone, have close sea and air links, use the same language and have similar regulatory frameworks. Source

And specifically for Northern Ireland

    The republic of Ireland is Northern Ireland’s primary external trading partner and its leading export market.Source.

The Idea that potential FDI's do not take into account the Infrastructure of the whole island when doing business here is absurd.

I though your postion was partition undermined trade between north and south, now you tell me the South heavily depends on it.

Sorry but the Irish market is small fry, FDIs only see one market in Euorpe and its centred around the UKL, France and Germany. 

 &gt;This is the nature of all FDI's worldwide it is a risk everywhere, what exactly is your point?

The Irish ecomney is not based on a strong oragnic indusutry but multi-nationals nesting for taxes reasons. the UK on the other hadn has a more robust underpinning and a safer bet in the long run to stay with.

 &gt;   If you are interested in serving the wider UK market, why would you locate off shore? Stability and transparency etc., is certainly questionable and the potential productivity increases available by locating to say Belfast are unclear. Even Labour costs while cheap by Irish standards, are considerably higher than those of say Poland. Labour costs may be an issue for manufacturing projects, it is the quality of the local workforce that matters for most projects locating on the island of Ireland. Germany’s lost territories of Silesia &amp; Prussia win hands down and have the direct transport links that enables products to be with customers within hours. A quick squint at the website of Wroclaw, the former German city of Breslau shows what you can attract when you tick all the boxes. (Wroclaw/Breslau’s university can boast 9 Nobel Prize winners, such as Theodor Mommsen, Philipp Lenard, Eduard Buchner, Paul Ehrlich, Fritz Haber, Friedrich Bergius, Erwin Schrödinger, Otto Stern and Max Born, admittedly mainly Germans.)

    Looking at individual cities, Dublin (4,615 jobs) is the third largest recipient of FDI jobs in Europe, beaten only by the Paris Region and Barcelona. The only city comparable to Belfast in the top ten is Freiburg (597 jobs). However it is located in Baden Wurttemberg, with a top class university, 500 years older than Queens, and at the centre of a massive transport infrastructure.

    Dublin is clearly a major hub of investment, attracting a substantial number of FDI projects in the ICT sector. Assuming it is Belfast’s intention to go after such projects, why would a company locate there over Cork, Limerick or Galway, which, despite having existing ICT sectors, struggle to compete against Dublin? Cork has Apple, EMC, Amazon, McAfee and VMware for example and all three locations provide the same wider benefits as Dublin, other than they do not have the concentration of activity that Dublin has.source

&gt; That backs up what I've been saying. Dublin will overshadow the North in a united Ireland aswell. As London currently does tot eh rest of the UK. If Dublin will take all the FDI in a UI how does that benfit the North? 

&gt;The fact of the matter is FDI is a risk but the south of Ireland is doing it much better at it, our current link to the UK is doing us damage.

Largely due to tax haven status, aslo as you conceded its not all roses across the south. Dublin get the majority of the love from FDIs at the wests expense. The same would hold true for the North in a UI.

&gt;Firstly the attempt to pass the west of the Bann of as underperforming economically; as if it where some natural occurence is absurd. It's underdevelopment, is directly linked to the colonisation, plantation and subsequent extraction of resources which fed the industrial revolution in Britain, this is inextricably linked to ensuing partition of this Island.

That's pretty mcuh what I said, the west of the north lags behind for historic reasons. Not due to the current affects of partition.  These issues are not directly casued by partion and ending partiton itself will not solve them. No one is denying the North has ecnominc proibnlems as a whole, it whether or not partition is preventing them being fixed. I have yet to see any evidence that it would. 



&gt;I think this shows the business community all ready see the benefits in All-Ireland co-operation when it comes the economy, in fact regardless of the border this tiny island already has a deeply interconnected economy.

No one is disputed economic interconnectivity is a good thing. We also need sterong economic ties with UK, Europe, US and ASIA. The question is doe we need to end partition to achieve this.

I pay myself a salary which is more than the National Insurance (NIC) Lower Earnings Limit (LEL) of £112 per week (2015/16) but less than the NIC Primary Threshold (PT) of £155 per week.

Because I am ""earning"" less than the PT, I don't pay any NIC Class 1 (and neither does my company). However, as my salary is higher than the LEL, my NIC record is credited as if I *had* paid NIC. So I retain my NIC credits for State Benefits purposes, such as State Pension, etc.

Such a salary figure is also well below the Income Tax Personal Allowance of circa £204 per week, so I don't pay Income Tax on my salary either.

As long as my (gross) dividend withdrawals do not, when added to my salary, take me over the Higher Rate Income Tax threshold (£42,385 in 2015/16), I will pay no Income Tax or NIC on any income withdrawals made from my company.",null,0,null,1428142566,null,0,1428142760,0,cq0ug2n,null,t3_31csnw,null,t1_cq0ug2n,null,t1_cq0hte7,null,null,null,1432189595,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

&gt;

&gt;The __Second Schleswig War__ ([Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language): *2. Slesvigske Krig*; [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Deutsch-Dänischer Krieg* ) was the second military conflict as a result of the [Schleswig-Holstein Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein_Question). It began on 1 February 1864, when Prussian forces crossed the border into Schleswig.

&gt;Denmark fought [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia) and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire). Like the [First Schleswig War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Schleswig_War) (1848–51), it was fought for control of the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg due to the succession disputes concerning them when the Danish king died without an heir acceptable to the [German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation). Decisive controversy arose due to the passing of the [November Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Schleswig-Holstein#The_November_Constitution), which integrated the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom in violation of the [London Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Protocol#1852).

&gt;Reasons for the war were the [ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic) controversy in Schleswig and the co-existence of conflicting political systems within the Danish [unitary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state).

&gt;The war ended on 30 October 1864, when the [Treaty of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Vienna_(1864\)) caused Denmark's cession of the Duchies of [Schleswig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig), [Holstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein), and [Saxe-Lauenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe-Lauenburg) to [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia) and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire).

It's not real. 

Most women don't like having 3 dicks at once, or being fisted and covered in semen, and those that do you probably want to steer clear of, you certainly don't want to be in a committed relationship with them since they will probably be doing that stuff with someone else behind your back if you don't do it, plus there's an increased risk of getting all sorts of diseases, and God help you if she gets pregnant. 

So, just remember that while you're making your socks crusty. Treat your woman like a Princess, and for fuck's sake, ALWAYS WEAR A CONDOM (when you're fucking) unless you fancy having a rugrat or two snapping at your ankles and puss oozing from your member.

Despite this failing, parts of my life story have been taught at teacher training colleges and some of my college work was retained as teaching material for others in later years.

I worked as a Teaching Assistant for about 15 years before officially becoming a Higher Level Teaching Assistant for another 15 years whilst undertaking further study through Birmingham University. As part of my work as a TA and HLTA I had all the training and responsibilities that you list above. My classroom teaching and all aspects of planning and assessment was subject to inspection by school management and Ofsted and was never found wanting. My lessons have been repeatedly rated as ""Outstanding"" by experienced and respected educators.

I can also clean up when a child sitting at the back of a team-taught classroom projectile vomits over the other 59 kids ;-) whilst qualified people lose their dignity.

In a lifetime of work with children of all ages I was part of various teams that benefited a huge number of children. In that time I have worked with some excellent teachers and I have also shouldered the burden of teaching in the face of some really appalling incompetence by people much more ""qualified"" than myself. I have played both supportive roles and lead roles in the classroom and been able to switch easily between the two, despite receiving none of the planning and preparation time or access to resources made available to qualified teachers and certainly nothing approaching the financial rewards they receive.

I have had qualified teachers act as my assistant and some qualified teachers I wouldn't want in my classroom, because they were truly ""incapable"".

It takes a team of people to participate in the running of a school for the benefit of the whole community. It is not helpful for anyone (least of all an NQT who doesn't know shit) to be dismissing others as incapable without seeing and understanding the scope of their work.

I highly recommend having a look through [Ed Moloney's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Moloney) blog.

Basically, there are no reports of injured soldiers in the circumstances described anywhere around the time leading up to Jean McConville's abduction and that story is likely a smokescreen on the level of the provos putting it about that she had eloped with a soldier and abandoned her children.

null,false,obrapop,EN,england,null,"&gt;'Stamford Bridge' is considered to be a corruption of 'Samfordesbrigge' meaning 'the bridge at the sandy ford'.[7] Eighteenth century maps show a 'Stanford Creek' running along the route of what is now a railway line at the back of the East Stand as atributary of the Thames. The upper reaches of this tributary have been known as Billingswell Ditch, Pools Creek and Counters Creek. In mediaeval times the Creek was known as Billingwell Dyche, derived from 'Billing's spring or stream'. It formed the boundary between the parishes of Kensington and Fulham. By the eighteenth century the creek had become known as Counter's Creek which is the name it has retained since.[8]

The stream had two local bridges: Stamford Bridge on the Fulham Road (also recorded as Little Chelsea Bridge) and Stanbridge on theKings Road, now known as Stanley Bridge.The existing Stamford Bridge was built of brick in 1860–2 and has been partly reconstructed since then.

Bad stuff first: We didn't know many people up here outside of work and we're both quite introverted. We ended up breaking up after about a year and a half, and I think a lot of that came down to how co-dependent we'd become. It will really help if you're good at making friends.

Good stuff: Lots! I have since moved back to Brighton, but I miss Yorkshire every day. I found an amazing job which launched my career, met some of the best friends I've ever known, and I think I'll always think of it as home. It's one of the most exciting adventures you can take - a chance to totally reinvent your life.

My top tip would be that you shouldn't rely on your job to provide you with friends. Join clubs, go on Meetup.com, start a team sport. One thing I learned after the break-up was that it's surprisingly easy to make friends, the hard part is putting yourself out there in the first place. I've joined board game clubs, roller derby training and attended loads of local video game events; your interests may be totally different to mine but there's always a group around to meet with!

null,false,VettelS,null,null,null,"&gt; Presently, if Joe Bloggs wants to watch some porn online, he goes to a porn site, asserts his age and accesses the porn, which is free of charge. Or he can choose to pay. But most people don't because aside from cost this would involve handing over personal details.

I agree that privacy may be a concern here, however there are plenty of ways of verifying someone's credit/debit card details - and therefore their age - without the porn website in question having access to that information. This should therefore be considered an implementation detail, and should not be considered in the context of the principle of this proposal.

&gt; How do you fancy identifying yourself to come on this site, because of r/gonewild? Even if you are ok with that, there will be millions who aren't.

It should be perfectly possible to word the legislation so that only certain parts of websites must be protected by an age barrier. I know that linked-to article refers to ""websites"", which suggests an entire domain, but that need not be the case.

&gt; It always, always comes down not not letting children have free rein to explore the internet until they are old enough to do so and that can't be done remotely, it must happen in the home. If parents struggle with that then they need to learn how to use the equipment in their homes. Don't give children connections in their rooms. Don't give them smartphones. It's cheaper and safer.

I agree with all of this - responsible parents would do all of these things. However, most parents don't meet this criteria, and consequently most children *do* have free and unhindered access to pornographic material online. If you consider that a problem, then you must accept that the government should have some role to play as well. Ideally, government intervention wouldn't be necessary, but clearly parental supervision isn't working; it's regrettable, but it is the case.",null,0,null,1428148898,null,0,false,0,cq0vodj,null,t3_31dzhk,null,t1_cq0vodj,null,t1_cq0ttlu,null,null,null,1432190174,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

His/her party membership will give you a good idea of their political leaning, the policies they are *likely* to support and *likely* direction of voting. However, your MP is not forced to follow the party line. On matters considered important to the party policy or politically sensitive, the party whip will apply considerable pressure on him to tow the line however even there he can choose to rebel and vote however he sees fit. Rebel back-benchers can often wield a lot of power, being a considerable embarrassment to the government, asking difficult questions and being the deciding votes determining whether or not a vote passes - especially when the government has a slim majority or coalition, as is likely to be the outcome of this election. 

Other factors you might want to look at is how often he bothers his arse to actually go to Westminster and vote, local matters he has put his weight behind, etc.

To me this seems like the GBNI leaders are trying to be ""diplomatic"" about a subject that their personal religious beliefs force them to take a hard-line stance on, while emphasizing that their non-denominational status means that *as an organisation* they have no official position and would really rather not make a big thing of it.

From personal experience, I know that a lot of Christans are perfectly fine with gay people personally (and not just in a ""love the sinner hate the sin"" way, they're ok with all of it) but when asked what their religion teaches, they're forced to concede that their Church thinks it's bad - but they don't, and think it's an outdated belief that's incompatible with modern Christianity.

One solution that was mentioned by /u/quzox 
&gt;A tax on unhealthy foods. This will lead to less burden on the NHS.

That would be one way to do it, tax fizzy drinks a lot so a can of Coke that currently costs £0.80, make it about £1.30, this would simply drive people away from fizzy drinks and at the same time fund the NHS' budget for helping obesity. 

In my experience as soon as I stopped drinking fizzy drinks I lost a lot of weight (fat) very quickly, this coupled with education to children about the foods they eat would eradicate most of the obesity in children (besides that of parents going to takeaways for them) which after a generation would change. 

Putting in a law for a 'food officer' (for lack of a better name) to go into a takeaway and ask for the nutritional information of their products, take some back to a lab and test them to check they were telling the truth. If they weren't fine them and have a point system much like driving points.

Also making every restaurant/takeaway/cafe display the nutritional information of their foods would deter people. The traffic light scheme works well here.

I agree with the energy plan you said, there is lots of sunlight and lots of empty desert that could be filled with these devices. The local people would be happier and you would make their local economies flourish because of all of the new produce they could grow.

In reality, as much as 99% (in 2010) of verification was done through a separate system tied to online banking access codes.  So the system exists, but even for relatively benign purposes has hardly any 'market share'.

Javid also implies by association that EiDs are used to control access to porn - whether that's true elsewhere I don't know, but it damn well isn't in Finland (erm, according to a friend... yeah).

null,false,stevekeiretsu,null,null,null,"&gt; We have done quite a bit of research on our own but would love to hear some more tips!

Apologies if I end up re-stating your research, as I'm not deep in ""hidden gem"" territory here, but I'll throw out a few basic Cambridge (area) ideas.

&gt; We are artsy people so we like art museums and such, but we also like night life as well.

You've probably already come across the Fitzwilliam, the uni's main museum, one of the more significant English collections outside London, and there's Kettle's Yard for more art, and [other museums too](https://www.cam.ac.uk/museums-and-collections/visit-us/our-museums).

Cambridge isn't so great for nightlife really because the students have their own private bubble instead of feeding the town's, but there are sometimes good things on at the Corn Exchange or the Junction.  And you find local live music in pubs like the Portland Arms.

Punting has been mentioned and acknowledge, however I may elaborate a little on the different ways of punting.

As American tourists you will be hustled for 'option 1', which is the guided tour, they'll collar you at Silver St or Magdalene St bridge with their straw boaters, pop the romantic couple on a private punt with a chauffeur to whisk you up and down the Backs to Jesus Green lock with a nice narration about the colleges history and so on.

Now, I in no way wish to discourage you from this! - as the guides are generally very good at what they do (I'm possibly biased as my mates used to do it for summer work), both the talk and the punting itself, and the Backs are a must-see, and you can take them in much better when you're not struggling with the boat...

HOWEVER.  If you wish to be ""like a local"" then you should go punting a second time, quite differently.  Find some more people, 4-6 in a boat is good, convoys of multiple boats with more people is also good.  Hire your punt(s) above Silver St weir and head the other direction, out of the city up to Granchester Meadows.  Do not hire a chauffeur, take turns in being hilariously terrible at punting the boat yourself.   Expect to crash into the bank and other boats frequently. Most importantly bear in mind that simply punting up to Granchester and back in the name of fun would be utterly ridiculous, however buying a literal boatload of beer and cider and punting, increasingly drunkenly, up to Granchester and back in the name of fun, is par for the course.

Outside Cambridge - there are a few stately homes if they are of any interest to you.  Oh, they always have fancy art collections that go over my head, so they probably will be?  Audley End is quite big, I can't remember much of it. Anglesey Abbey is fairly small but has lovely gardens and a working mill. Wimpole Hall was 'my local', we'd always go walking in the landscaped park, it has a rare breed farm too.  Woburn Abbey is a bit further away but has a next-level art collection, a room FULL of massive Canalettos managed to impress even this philistine.

There's the aircraft section of the Imperial War Museum at Duxford.  It seems they're doing a [VE Day Anniversary Airshow](http://www.iwm.org.uk/exhibitions/iwm-duxford/iwm-duxford-air-shows) while you're here, probably a load of Spitfires and such flying around, could be fun!  Air show days get super busy though so if you want to go I'd get on the case quickly and allow plenty of time to get there, sometimes even the M11 (freeway) would be queued up solid on air days.

It's clearly his opinion, but it's hard to dispute his two key points:

1. MI6 [has done similar things](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/04/uk.politicalnews6) in the past.
2. The claim that it's a ""protocol requirement"" that meetings involving foreign Ambassadors must be documented for the FCO didn't happen in the 20 years he worked at the FCO or was a UK Ambassador.

My own two cents is that a simpler explanation is that the Telegraph simply made it up, or a civil servant within the FCO (or, perhaps more likely, the Scottish Office) did so.

All of the parties involved deny these statements were made, the FCO [now deny there is a memo](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-leaked-memo-inquiry-1-3738295), so that leaves the Telegraph or an individual civil servant as the most likely inventors.

Which it was is a question only the Telegraph can answer.

If their civil servant is someone they know actually exists, and someone they talked to in person to verify it first, then that's probably who fabricated it.

If they received it via some kind of anonymous tip then they've been played by someone familiar enough with the workings of the civil service to make it appear genuine.",null,0,null,1428152349,null,0,false,0,cq0wmd6,null,t3_31etwo,null,t1_cq0wmd6,null,t1_cq0vmq8,null,null,null,1432190620,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

It'll be interesting to see what happens with Trident, given that [75% of Labour candidates](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/exclusive-75-labour-ppcs-oppose-trident-renewal) also oppose renewal.

Perhaps Miliband would be able to force renewal through with the aid of the Conservatives but renewal is by no means the certainty it once was.

&gt; If voters in Scotland feel the SNP helped deliver a Conservative government by playing hardball with labour that could backfire on them significantly.

This has been the backbone of Labour's ""Vote SNP, Get Tory"" campaign up here.

Unfortunately that argument has lost a great deal of its power, largely due to the oft-repeated scenario of Scotland voting Labour yet getting a Conservative government anyway.

I think a more plausible description is that if Scotland largely votes SNP yet rest of the UK deliver a Conservative government then most people in Scotland will see that outcome as arising due to the rest of the UK rather than due to the SNP.

Arguably that strengthens the SNP's position, as they can simply point to that as proof that Scotland is politically different from the rest of the UK.",null,0,null,1428153268,null,0,false,0,cq0ww7n,null,t3_31amnk,null,t1_cq0ww7n,null,t1_cq0i6v2,null,null,null,1432190748,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

There was also the role of the Forschungsamt in tapping Embassy communications allowing Hitler to be sure that France and Britain would not go to war over Austria or Czechoslovakia, though that's more within the accepted remit of an intelligence agency.

It undermines both the SNP's growing public perception and introduces doubt about the viability of a legitimate Lab/SNP partnership.

Whilst the SNP have a seemingly plausable reason for subversively support the conservatives it's really an overly simplistic interpretation. (and consider how that works anyway ~ what presumption is that based upon?) 

Yes, the SNP may think a conservative majority would hasten the north south divide by driving scottish polarisation but are they willing to support it to the detriment of both scotland and england? 

As far as they are concerned a split is a natural inevitability and whilst handing the conservatives leadership may hasten that they also view the conservative policies followed as being actively destructive to scotland and the UK as a whole by extension.

Moreno's defending has let us down again.

I feel so sorry for Markovic, I thought he looked pretty sharp but again he's the one sacrificed at half time. Particularly frustrating considering the situation and the performance of some of the others on the pitch.

Henderson and Sterling are both wasted at wing-back, and it seems like the only position Markovic has excelled in. When they're all available it seems like simple solution.

The EILI5 idea is to draw out the other team and create space.

A little more detail.  You're right to think that when the two back defenders knock the ball back and forth the other team can sit back and wait.  BUT, watch when Liverpool have the ball.  The defenders will wait for a midfielder to come running back to them.  The ball will be played to that midfielder.  This pass forces an opponent to rush up and cover the midfielder.  This is where the space is created!  The midfielder usually passes one touch right back to the defenders and the midfielder will immediately turn and head up pitch.  Now Liverpool are in the seemingly same position. *but with more open spaces ahead*.

This space-opening sequence will be repeated 3-4 times to get the opponents out of position and to open up space.  Finally, once there is a pass into the new open space, or one of those midfielders gets the ball with a lot of time, the game moves forward.

You're probably right, tbh.  Despite the seductive logic of controlled chaos, i think such schemes [tend not to deliver on their hopes](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/04/where-crashes-are-shared-space-and.html).

That said, from what i can tell, Paris and London are [more or less comparable](http://archive.etsc.eu/documents/Background_tables.pdf) in terms of road deaths, though there's obviously more differences than just the roundabouts.

The rules are nice, but there's a tendency for people to get too entitled about them: it can be quite nerve-wrecking entering a large multi-lane roundabout when you're not entirely sure which lane takes you to the right lane of the exit you're after, because you know that if you need to make a last-minute change, no-one's really going to want to let you in (or slow down much to avoid cutting you up on their way out).

Toure is experienced - yes, but he is too slow, also gets himself into trouble way too often and is also an admirer of the ""hip-high-backpasses"" every goalie loves and he never wins air-duels. Lovren needs no explaining. Lucas is also back to his usual perfomances of the last 2 years (I know he was very good for us once and he had good games this season, but everybody played well at that time).

We need new strikers. REAL strikers. Sturridge is good - yes, but his last great season was heavily impacted by Suarez great season. He is also injury-prone as fuck and loves to dribble himself into hopeless situations instead of shooting or passing. Balotelli gets too few minutes, but I think the experiment is done. Borini is no answer in any way.

We need impact subs. Look at our bench .. Sure, we have some injured players, but this bench was just aweful for such a big match. Nobody able to make a difference, so no point in even bringing them on.

The Scottish left abandoned labour, and in turn the union, because they had been absolutely complicit, if not at the very centre of these kinds of smear. 

The British left could have halted that swing towards independence, had they defended the truth, rather than side with the Tory rags and the leaked memos etc. Remember that Telegraph front page with all those FTSE 100 signatories? We got one of those too 6 months ago. I don't recall back then, the Guardian and Independent pointing out how many of them were Tory donors, or peers, or advisers or tax dodgers etc.

We also had a handful of leaked memos, from the ""impartial"" civil service, to the right wing press.

The late surge towards independence had much more to do with a sense of abandonment by the British left than anything else IMO. This being a British left who's main defence against independence was solidarity...

Emergency medicine for example, we just don't have the staff and the departments to meet targets anymore. The problem is, like a shop, a department gets given a number of manpower hours a month they're allowed to 'spend'. This might mean they've got a skeleton crew running the ship half the time, if there's a serious accident then A&amp;E can no longer cope.

Giving the NHS a bigger budget, will directly translate in being able to free up manpower budgets, which means that departments can be properly staffed.

For all the shit slinging at NHS management, we have one of the best managed health services in the world in terms of health outcomes per £ invested, we know exactly where to spend a 1%, 5% or 10% investment to get best bang for buck already.

I imagine, for the record, it would be mental health high on the list.

Had some good interplay between our midfielders, especially after that initial wave from Arsenal and if we converted that chance early on  I thought that we could really push on from there and get a real foothold in the game. After that first Arsenal goal, however, I sensed a letdown and I knew we wouldn't recover fully from that. 

Moreno and Toure were bad today, especially Moreno. If we had a healthy Ibe in that wing back role, I think the game would have been totally different as he is both a better attacking player as well as being more intelligent defensively. 

Our biggest problem this season has been the inability to bring in goal scorers. The only person we bought with a history of scoring goals does not even make the bench. Although we had a great run of form recently, I was never fully convinced it would be sustainable because we were relying too heavily of goals from midfield and the goals we were getting were of the wonder goal variety. We have no goal scoring threats in the final third. Sterling's shooting is downright shocking and I don't see it improving too much since he came into the team. Daniel is not fit and/or not adjusting well in this system that Brendan has been forced to play given the personnel. Btw, I love Sahko. 


Ultimately, I can say I'm that crestfallen. I think we are at the same point in the development of this team as we were in Brendan's first season. If we can buy some goal scoring threats that can settle in quickly for next season, I think that we can really have a great season and possibly even challenge for the title. Our start to the season really did us in this year and it was always going to be  a struggle to recover from that. A summer off from International competition should really give a lot of players a break to recover both mentally and physically.

&gt;

&gt;The __Battle of Trafalgar__ (21 October 1805) was a [naval engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_battle) fought by the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) against the combined fleets of the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Navy) and [Spanish Navies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Navy), during the [War of the Third Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition) (August–December 1805) of the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars) (1803–1815).

&gt;The battle was the most decisive naval victory of the war. Twenty-seven British [ships of the line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_the_line) led by [Admiral Lord Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson) aboard [HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory) defeated thirty-three French and Spanish ships of the line under French Admiral [Pierre-Charles Villeneuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Charles_Villeneuve) off the southwest coast of Spain, just west of [Cape Trafalgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Trafalgar), in Caños de Meca. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost.

&gt;The British victory spectacularly confirmed the naval supremacy that Britain had established during the eighteenth century and was achieved in part through Nelson's departure from the prevailing naval [tactical orthodoxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_tactics_in_the_Age_of_Sail), which involved engaging an enemy fleet in a single line of battle parallel to the enemy to facilitate signalling in battle and disengagement, and to maximise fields of fire and target areas. Nelson instead divided his smaller force into two columns directed perpendicularly against the larger enemy fleet, with decisive results.

&gt;Nelson was shot by a French musketeer during the battle and died shortly after, becoming one of Britain's greatest war heroes. Admiral Villeneuve was captured along with his ship [*Bucentaure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Bucentaure_(1803\)). Spanish Admiral [Federico Gravina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Carlos_Gravina_y_N%C3%A1poli) escaped with the remnant of the fleet and succumbed months later to wounds sustained during the battle. Villeneuve attended Nelson's funeral while a captive on parole in Britain.

They never claimed on behalf of an individual and could argue their 'source' was trustworthy. It's like saying IT IS BELIEVED ACCORDING TO SOMEONE WE MET IN A PUB: then saying it's in the public interest. You've got no one to sue and they can use a public interest defence.

The thing is you should also consider secondary effects. 

SNP turns around to sue the telegraph this close to an election and the tele will selectively report every single rumour comment horseshit and bullshit they can get their hands on to undermine the public perception of the SNP causing them more man hours and damage than the initial article was actually worth. 

(they'll do it anyway but a court case gives them a big fuck victim card to play with and their target audience isn't scotland)

Edit: Other thing. If the goal was to get Milliband to undermine himself they've already done that in spades anyway and now he looks like the public fool.

Cos he's shot his mouth off he can't even retract or apologise cos he'll just confirm the public's perception that Sturgeon saying he's not PM material is true. Which he did, Which he's not.

Bale would give a different sort of ability than our other players, with his pace and power, but Isco is so much more technical and his dribbling is amazing to watch. Some have compared him to Iniesta and he's an hard worker too, not just flair. I think Isco has better potential in a team like ours, while Bale needs to be in a team where he is the main source of attacking and is given freedom like he was given at Tottenham. I would rather us not be a team that relies on one player and because we probably wont rely on him, I see him being invisible some games if we do end up signing him.

Also Isco is better at quick short passing than Bale,  which is why I prefer Isco. My mouth waters at the thought of Silva, Aguero, and Isco's link up.

Second: I think BR's formation change helped us have a bit more composure in the second half but the nail on the coffin was already hammered before halftime. We never really looked threatening and missed glorious chances in the first half. One thing that's clear is that we have to change formation. The 3421 hasn't been fluid at all the past few games and teams are already figuring out how to stop it completely. Be it the 442 diamond or 4141 or any other formation he comes up with, it has to change. 

Third: Kolo and Lucas didn't have match fitness at all and it showed. Kolo was constantly making defensive errors and putting Migs under pressure and Lucas really struggled to impose authority in midfield. 

And finally, it's time to stop feeling sorry about ourselves. Top 4 was always going to be hard because of our start of the season and honestly, all of our downfalls this season (except for Sturridge's injury) have been because of our own fault. We've simply missed too many chances, lost countless psychological battles (CL, Chelsea semifinal, Man Utd defeat) and have struggled to step up when things start falling apart (obviously there are some exceptions). 
I'm sick of our constant underestimation and feeling less than others. We've shown we have quality and exciting young talent. We've shown we have character. We've shown countless times before we can exceed expectations and prove people wrong. We've had progress under FSG and BR. Yes, we haven't been in the CL for 5 years. Yes, we haven't won the league in over twenty years. Yes, Chelsea, Man City, Man Utd and Arsenal have been more successful the past years, but you know what? Fuck it. Fuck that. We got to the top level of football clubs through hard work and determination. We're respected throughout the world. We won the CL in 2005 against all the odds.

You're basically saying selling a car is entirely up to the salesman, and it doesn't matter if its a BMW M3 or a Fiat Punto.

&gt; Rangers were liquidated in 2012. The ranking the following season would not have been affected by that. the following two seasons have remained the same, with the first an improvement on the season before. That table does not show what you think it does, in fact it shows the decline during the seasons that Rangers were in Europe. It's really not helping your case

I don't think you understand how the coefficients are calculated.

The coefficient rankings for each year are calculated over a 5 year period.  Rangers Uefa cup run in 2007-2008 was still affecting the rankings up until 2011-2012. In 2010-2011, Rangers made the group stages and then parachuted into the Europe league where they got to the last 16. Therefore their contribution to the coefficient is still actually being felt today. The problem is, only Celtic have really been topping up the points tally since Rangers went down to division 3.

You are deluding yourself if you do not see that Scotland's current position is directly correlated with Rangers current weakness. Celtic are the only ones currently making any meaningful contribution.  Things were better in the previous decade when either Ranger or Celtic or both were putting in a performance nearly early season.

Here's a thing.  Over 5 years, right?  That means that the seasons where Rangers results in Europe are taken into account there's been a steady decline.  This steady decline has seen a reduction in the number of teams from Scotland that play in European competition, which affects the way the coefficient is determined, which affects our ranking.

*ALPHA MALE? James ‘Jimbo’ Shortt, who says he was the ‘first outsider to train KGB personnel’ inside the former Soviet Union*

----

AS Britain starts to deploy military advisers to Ukraine, offering medical and intelligence expertise, along with infantry and logistical training, the Eye can reveal that one military asset has been operating in Ukraine since 2006 offering expert training of his own.
Step forward James “Jimbo” Shortt, director-general of the International Bodyguard Association (IBA) and holder of a papal knighthood “for his work in bringing the Cold War to an end”. Also calling himself “hereditary Colonel Commandant” of the Royal Galloglas Guard and Colonel the Chevalier Baron of Castleshort, Shortt’s dubious military credentials are well known to readers (see Eyes 1223 &amp; 1228).

### Immodium and rubber bands

Shortt offers “counter terror operations” expertise to any Ukrainian or foreign “others” who stump up £950 and have the necessary kit to train with his “Tiger Spetsnaz Counter Terror Group” in the Crimea. The fact that local law has only ever allowed Shortt’s graduates to arm themselves with “BB guns, air pistols or rubber bullets” doesn’t diminish the size of his potential market. In 2006 the Ukrainian State Guard Service estimated it to have an annual countrywide turnover of US$5.6m.

The kit required for Shortt’s course includes a “desert camouflage BDU [battle dress uniform] assault suit”, even though Crimea isn’t known for its desert terrain; plus a “supply of Immodium and aspirin”, and “rubber bands for holding trouser bottoms over boots”. Candidates will also need “a baseball cap/fatigue cap”. Those entitled to wear a beret and badge, eg “Airborne Maroon”, as Shortt calls it, can wear them for the final parade.

Entitlement to wear the “maroon lid”, the beret awarded to Parachute Regiment members, would presumably preclude Shortt from wearing his. As the Eye pointed out, Jimbo’s CV described him as “Badged Parachute Regiment (1976)” as well as “Special Air Service Regt (SAS) (1980)”, when he was never “badged” by either. Shortt claimed to have served in the 10th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, and B and HQ Squadron, 21st Special Air Service Regiment, when in fact he had only served for a few months as a medic in the Territorial Army.

### Russian Alpha unit

Despite the doubters, the Ukrainian government has been impressed and even awarded Shortt “the Presidential Order of Merit in recognition of his work training Ukrainian Government Bodyguard units and Counter Terrorist teams since independence”, according to one of Jimbo’s IBA brochures. Shortt adds that he has been “similarly honoured by Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Hungary, Belgium, Slovenia, Croatia and the Vatican”.

Impressive as this may be, the current regime in Ukraine may be less happy about another feather in Jimbo’s cap. The KGB Alpha Team Training Manual 2009, which includes a foreword by Shortt, reveals that he “was the first outsider to train KGB personnel” inside the former Soviet Union. This training included members of the feared Russian Alpha unit, which was then still operating in Ukraine and some of whose members Shortt trained in person.

During last year’s Ukrainian revolution, Alpha snipers were alleged to have shot at anti-Russian demonstrators with real rounds, rather than airgun pellets. The Ukrainian military was so concerned the Alpha unit was finally purged. However, one of its commanders, Alexander Khodakovsky, fled to become commander of the pro-Russian Vostok Battalion and later commander of the pro-Russian “Patriotic Forces of Donbass” in Donetsk. He eventually became security minister of the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic – the same self-proclaimed state Ukraine is now fighting using some of Jimbo’s own highly trained cadre.

null,false,badebola,lfc55,,null,"What we try to do is play a possession based system offensively, and a high energy press defensively. 

Although the formation has changed, we're playing pretty much the exact same system we played last year. Our CBs are holding the ball until the midfielders can create space, through overlapping runs, to pick up the ball. If you notice how Coutinho, and Lallana play, they're often making runs just so Hendo/Allen can get on the ball. From there, our fullbacks bomb forward in part to help retain possession and overload their defensive half, but also to pull their fullbacks wider, and create gaps in their defence. This allows our midfield runners, and pacey strikers like Sturridge to play off the shoulder, and bomb through the gap to create chances. We also like to play a compact midfield on the ""offensive phase"" which causes the defenders to push up to create space behind their line, and on the wings. We also like to play on the counter. But our counter, like most counters, are pretty much standard/situational stuff. 

Offensively, some of the problems we face are: 

We've lost Suarez's ability to drop off the last man and hold the ball up and turn. This was massive last year as it'd pull one of their CBs into midfield, create massive gaps in the back, and allow the wingers/full backs to push on and get behind them. Also, Sturridge would then make a darting run, and theres very few CBs in the game that can mark him one on one in that space. I think Balo was brought in to do his job and replace him - but frankly Balo's work rate isn't there, and he just doesn't have the quality Suarez had. Not to diminish Balo though, as theres very few strikers in the world that have the hold up play that Suarez had. 

Oppositions are sitting deep against us. Why's this bad? Because our entire system revolves around creating gaps in their defense and running in behind. If they sit deep, Sturridge can't make those runs. This is why you see a lot of fiddling around on the edge of the box, and why Coutinho/Hendo/Sterling/Sturridge have been instructed to have a go pretty much any time they're in that area. 

Gerrard's also not pinging 40 yard balls anymore. This is bad because previously if the defenders were sitting deep, then we'd just keep dropping, and get Gerrard on the ball. Their defence and midfield would, hopefully, push up to close down the space and stay with their man. This would create space behind and on the wings, and then with a 40 yard ball to one of our fullbacks/strikers, we would've effectively skipped the midfield possession stage to get into that dangerous ball in the final third. Gerrard's passing ability, and this system, is why you heard a lot of commentators remark last year that the goal came out of nowhere. Gerrard's not the same this year, and our defence has just been so shaky, so having him slot in as ""the third CB"" just isn't really an option anymore sadly.

I'm finding it a bit difficult to verbalize, and could really do with a white board, but if you have any questions/want me to elaborate on anything just let me know. This is hardly a complete assessment of our play style as well, just a couple notable elements. 

Also, like a couple others have noted, the pretty much common theme of our play is possession, movement, creating space. This is why Henderson is so fantastic for us, because he fits our system perfectly as his energy, movement, and short passing game are really good. 

Edit: To those moaning about passing around the back, you don't realize how good we have it in England, imagine watching Serie A. And Rodger's does have a system, and IMO, its a rather good one. At its best, it follows a spanish style of play, but modified because we don't have the quality of their players.",null,0,null,1428160832,null,0,1428161025,0,cq0zugy,null,t3_31f1eb,null,t1_cq0zugy,null,t3_31f1eb,null,null,null,1432192139,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null
null,false,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"&gt; Look, you may not actually want to believe it, but the league has been more competitive throughout since Rangers left.

Lol, go up and look at my first comment at the top of this thread:

&gt; Relative to itself, Scottish football is probably doing better since Rangers dropped down the divisions **with it being more competitive** and a lot of teams shedding debt.

I literally said that.

&gt; There's been nothing wrong with the product. It's when the people selling it have undervaluing and running it down there's been a problem.

Well fan's outside the Old Firm might be happier with the product. However, their is an international economic boom for football across the world and Scotland are missing out. We have fallen relative to other European leagues, as the coefficient table shows, and we are being usurped by leagues on other continents.  This is important for attracting an audience and for attracting talent to the league.

&gt; It's when the people selling it have undervaluing and running it down there's been a problem.

The clubs themselves were directly involved in negotiating the TV deal. Do you not remember Peter Lawell's steering group? 

Now I am not his biggest fan, but as the guy who represented Scottish football's strongest brand at the time I think it was absolutely appropriate that he headed up the TV deal negotiations. What do you think should and could have been done differently? 

Scottish football had already weakened their position previously by backing Setanta against the wishes of both Old Firm clubs.
 
Sky have their current position of power because they were the only ones that could pick up the pieces of that failed deal. Perhaps in the next round of negotiations we will have more options.

&gt; As for the co-efficient, we'll have to see what happens with that. But, even you now admit you have no way of saying exactly what effect Rangers liquidation has had on it.

I never claimed to know ""exactly what effect"" Rangers liquidation has had on it - it's impossible. What I can say for certain is that there is a direct correlation between the decline in Scotland's coefficient, and Rangers ability to compete in Europe.  It's a statistical fact.


Edit: I'm responding to your edit

Let me make this simple for you. [Here](http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html) is a link to the individual clubs coefficient rankings.  Note that Rangers are still Scotland's second highest contributor, despite not being able to play in Europe for the last 3 years. If Rangers have ""dragged it down"" its because they've not been able to play there. Or you can admit the truth and say it's because no other Scottish team has stepped up to fill their shoes.

* Way bigger squad. Competition for every place. We have players on the bench who are so much worse than the starters. They are on completely different level. 

* Focus only on europe. It works better for smaller teams whose league isn't the most difficult and who aren't under huge pressure to do well in the league (to even get to europe). We aren't neither of those and just focusing on cups isn't a real choice for us. 

So, we need better players competing for the starting XI. If our starting eleven is fit, they have no real competition. Attacking replacements like Lallana, Markovic are too inconsistent or too often injured. When they're in good form they can easily push for starting XI place but who else is there? 

We probably have many players leaving in the summer who aren't on the required level anymore. Hopefully they will be replace with upgrades. If not, we're staying almost on the same level without being able to compete in several competitions if at all.

There is a huge human trafficking issue here in the UK, especially when it comes to prostitution. There is a huge debate about whether decriminalisation would help or hinder that - personally, I am torn as well.

Decriminalisation hasn't reduced trafficking in Amsterdam which has seen an increase as a result. Meanwhile, New Zealand has legalised prostitution but not had the same problems - though many argue because New Zealand is quite isolated geographically.

Additionally, the current UK model is already somewhat decriminalised: being an escort is legal, just not soliciting sex publicly.  ",null,0,null,1428161344,null,0,false,0,cq10301,null,t3_31emxz,null,t1_cq10301,null,t1_cq0yxj4,null,null,null,1432192251,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

On the second class members point, I have never heard anyone use this publicly (maybe amongst MSP's and AM's it is a thing).

Finding a system for such a mess isn't trivial. I'm amazed that we even found some temporary solution that doesn't require a striker. Looks very likely that it will be ditched, though. When pressed hard we have been looking very vulnerable.

The big shortcoming was the summer transfer window. Not getting a striker. I support the thought that some have come up with: let's ditch the transfer committee and let's give one person the power to buy what he wants and not what he doesn't want. Then we have that person to blame for when things aren't happening and can replace the person responsible.

one or two brilliant players would automatically improve the players around them (either by opening up space on the pitch or making us more solid at the back).

you can focus on europe all you want, but I have not seen enough from Rodgers to make me actually think that he would be able to grab it by the balls next year. he needs more time to learn and i am not sure we can afford to wait for him to figure it out.

Except it's not a statistical fact.  Indeed, the very opposite is and you yourself have given me the evidence.

Look again at the table you provided.  Between 2006-07, the first season for which you provided evidence and 2012-13, the last season where Rangers results in Europe effected the coefficient, we went from 10th to 24th.  Indeed, from 2007-08 to 2012-13, it's been year on year.

The following two seasons, where Rangers not being in Europe were taken into account, there was a one place rise followed by no change.  With Aberdeen almost getting to the Europa group stages and Celtic getting past the Champions League group stages, the next coefficient ranking will be the same or improve.  So the stats actually back up what I'm saying.

I don't think my view is twisted at all and as I said I don't think their influence is that large, simply because it doesn't need to be. Independence might be popular with a lot of people, myself included, but there were no polls showing a substantial majority and for all talk of the SNP ""controlling Miliband"" they only have 6 MP's and personally I don't think they will get anywhere near 50 seats some polls predict. How much power they will end up with after the election is debatable and they may well end up with none at all. Also I'm aware that this is not MI5 related but look at the McCrone report and how it was made secret for 30 years.

Illegality wouldn't really matter during all out nuclear war. Not like anybody will be able to enforce any sort of legal action afterwards!

Britain likely wouldn't first strike (i.e. be the first to use) nuclear weapons. Realistically only the US or Russia could do that. So Trident is really only defensive, and about posturing. It means that nobody will hit us, because we can always hit back.

It has to be three, since that's the minimum needed to have constant presence and allow for 2 subs to be undergoing maintenance and repair.

Think about Russia. They're actually a shitty, unimportant country. They have an economy the size of Italy. Yet they are very important - a permanent UNSC member etc. That's only because they have a shitload of nukes. That buys influence and power. Nobody will fuck with them, even when they are blatantly wrong or being dickheads (like with East Ukraine right now).

Also, if you consider the world and the countries in it, the UK is probably one of the best to own nuclear weapons. They are bad things, for sure. But we can't UN-invent the technology. So if some countries are going to have them, the UK is *definitely* on the side of ""good guys"". I'm much less nervous about the UK having nukes than Pakistan, Israel, Iran or North Korea.

Maybe if Rodgers hadn't alienated Balotelli and made him a scapegoat so early on, he could be useful?  Balotelli's only won a bunch of trophies, titles, and led his country to the Euro Cup final.  

Can was playing defence with Lovren on the bench, no real striker?  Borini and Sturridge on the bench and Balotelli at home...  How was the midfield supposed to work?  

Hell, 2 of Borini/Sturridge/Balo should have been on as forwards, then you could have Raheem where he's best (AM), Lucas at DM (where he's best), pick 2 of Couts/Hendo/Can/Marko for your midfielders , and a back 4 of Moreno, Sakho, Lovren, and Johnson (or Can or Manquillo).  

No, instead everyone is playing a position that doesn't suit them just so Rodgers can have his precious 3-4-3 formation that only seems to work against weak teams.  And maybe they would have lost to Arsenal anyway, but all season they've crashed out of every competition, and their biggest feat was to have a chance at top 4, even though that looks out of reach now too.  

And yes Liverpool doesn't have the quality of other top teams, and the way they're going, never will.  No one will ever want to go to an over-hyped, under-performing team with a manager that makes all his players look bad and forces them into roles they've never been suited to...

Actors are paid well but it's a small fraction of the overall production cost. There's a huge amount of highly skilled experienced (and unionised) staff required in the production of a TV show.

Has everyone forgotten last year? Most of that team are still here. So, when the sides that started slowly finally caught form, which they were always going to do, when the rest of the league figured out our new players, which they were always going to do, and once the injuries started to come, which was always going to happen, the league found its usual shape. And now that it has people are freaking out about it. West Ham will progress every year, but they're not going to go from a relegation candidate to a top 4 side in one season.

His pace can change the game also, and with our set piece quality- his ability to draw fouls from the opposition is something that will lead to numerous goals over the course of a campaign. 

We are predictable without pace, and although his final ball is a bit lacking, his ability to really kickstart a counter, or run at defenses who are maybe pushing up to close us down (as so, so many teams do); are invaluable. 

I see the future as pushing towards playing with 2 very dynamic defensive wingers, and having the fullbacks perform something of a deep poacher role. We have seen Coleman do this time and again, where he drifts into the back post and taps in crosses- and it is an amazing foil that is so tough to defend against, and Lennon facilitates it perfectly.

EDIT: OK, looking back I did say that he was the signing of the window for any team- which is perhaps slightly OTT, but other than maybe Naughton, I can't think of another player who has had such a positive impact.

Of course - everyone involved in that particular case is long dead. That said, as the last paragraph in that article says:

&gt; The Zinoviev letter was not the only attempt by the security and intelligence services to destabilised a Labour government. Peter Wright, a former MI5 officer, showed in Spycatcher how elements in his agency worked against the Wilson government in the 1970s.

While tinfoil-hat wearing nutjobs can easily see something where there's nothing, I think it's similarly naive to assume that the intelligence services in this decade are somehow unable to indulge in the kind of shady things that have frequently been done in the past.

Personally I think Murray is jumping to conclusions to say this is definitely the work of the intelligence services - it seems far more likely to simply be an invention of the Telegraph or a partisan civil servant.

So not making it this year would represent a step back, but with a young squad and relative pull by virtue of the clubs stature and promise moving forward, I don't see how not making CL this season makes much of a difference *for this window*. Players want to play in Europe, but we target (relative) youth anyway, and we are a palatable prospect for up and coming youth. Did last season teach you nothing? Look at last summers transfer window. We missed out on every high profile target we went after, whilst sides like United managed just fine. Every other signing we made would have been made from 5th or 6th place. CL does not instantly mean you can challenge in the transfer market. It's so naive and reductive to think this.

Ha, just no, have you seen the policies the tories are trying to push through in the name of children, they are all BS 1984 style ideas. Whereas the Lib Dems are pretty close to the opposite. 

&gt; As for the SNP, pairing with Labour wouldn't end well IMO. Bearing in mind that Labour and the SNP are competing for seats, that means voters who voted SNP didn't want Labour. For the SNP to then basically put Labour in power would be a slap in the face to those voters.

I do agree with this point, but the fact they are stealing votes from each other that means that their voters largely agree with each other on many subjects, just people are fed up with the main parties just being dicks. 

It is an interesting conundrum, is it better to have the seats in parliament but not be able to achieve anything because you are in a significant minority, or better to join up with the party who all your voters have chosen not to vote for and have more influence, the latter is better for Scotland, the former is more popular and political, but kind of defeats the point of being there in the first place. 

The real question is if they can negotiatate a coaltition that doesn't compromise their values, though the Lib Dems, from polling data, lost a large proportion of voters from just making the coalition, not from doing anything in it, and then never recovered, the real question is if they stood up for anything people noticed, such as tuition fees an in your face fee, then maybe they could have recovered by actually standing on what people elected them for, but they didn't. 

&gt; That said, I don't think the SNP would have a problem with any coalition. They can blame all problems on ""Westminster"", and claim all successes as being due to their influence. 

But you create a Labour Prime Minster, that could easily be a PR nightmare losing support, a lot of thing politician do people don't notice, the tories managed to raise VAT from 17.5% to 20% and apparently that is non-issue of the election... 

&gt; As an English guy, I don't want the SNP getting power because they will use it to create division and still try to split up the UK.

This is the other problem, they don't have the interest of the UK at heart in the slightest, they literally don't care, devolution just makes you irrelevant on a world stage, when you are irrelevant no one cares what you have to say, Scotland is large holding itself up on oil, it is ticking time bomb without diversification, but that is the long term, people don't think 25 years in advance.

Two CBs? Skrtel and Sakho are fine, Lovren's been improved in recent weeks, Toure is a perfectly fine 4th choice who has the occassional really poor game but is mostly solid. We've got Ilori coming back in the summer. Can who is a solid option. We don't need any centre-backs. We had 5 clean sheets away from home before today.

We've got Flanagan and Manquillo who are both solid options defensively. Moreno who has his defensive weaknesses but is young and clearly talented. Offers decent build up play and a good option out wide. Maybe get in a more experienced left back as another option but I wouldn't say its a priority.
 
If Lucas stays, and Can moves forward next year we need a good first team option to take Gerrard's role, and maybe a better player to replace Lucas imo. 

We've got Origi coming in, and so I think we only need to go for one more striker who is first team material. Mourinho gets by fine with 3 strikers. That's before we consider that we might hold on to some of the others we have right now.

I guarantee that 2 games ago you wouldn't have mentioned half those players were needed. Just because some are out of form now doesn't mean their deadwood ffs. You bring in some quality options with end product and suddenly the players you want replacing now start to become productive members of the squad. We brought in numbers last summer, now we can try for a few top class (relative) options to lift the standard. We have a young team. It's not inconceivable the players we currently have become a lot better next season with a season of English football under their belts.

What the correlation means is open to interpretation, but the correlation's existence is fact. 

&gt;  Between 2006-07, the first season for which you provided evidence and 2012-13, the last season where Rangers results in Europe effected the coefficient, 

You are wrong. Rangers reached the Champions league group stage in 2010-11, and then went onto reach the last 16 of the Europa League. This still affects the coefficient right up until **this season**. Craig Whyte took over in 2011 and since then Rangers' abilitiy to compete in Europe has been crippled. They didn't qualify for either the Champions League or the Europa League that season and Celtic only qualified for the Europa league group stages but went no further. Together, these were the biggest reasons for Scotland dropping from 18th to 24th. 

Rangers were relegated the following season and  in their absence nobody has been able to reverse this drop. This is my point - Scottish football has suffered in European competition. 

Realistically, Scotland should be about 15th in the rankings - the lowest ranking the gives two potential Championse league places. When they were 10th they were punching above their weight because of Rangers Uefa Cup run, along with Celtic and Rangers making it to the last 16 a total of 3 times in that same decade. When were were 18th it wasn't good but it wasn' terrible, but we should be definitely be above 20th.  Without two teams contributing this is probably not achievable.

&gt; With Aberdeen almost getting to the Europa group stages and Celtic getting past the Champions League group stages,

This year Celtic didn't make it to the Champions League group stages. I can see why you think Scottish football teams are doing better in Europe when you are making up results. Also, ""almost getting to the Europa group stages"" would be considered an under-performance in a track record that includes Rangers. 

&gt; I get it. you're a Rangers fan. But there really is no need to lie to try and defend your team when you have proven you're lying.

How have I proven to be lying? 

I've been far more objective than you have about the state of Scottish football. I recognise that some things have been improved since Rangers were relegated but Scottish performance in Europe is not one of them. That you are trying to argue otherwise is ludicrous.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"Small team in terms of quality. We still have fringe players in our first team. We still have fillers, inconsistent performers in and around the first team. We severely lack consistently good players. Today we had our weakest squad in quite some time in terms of the starting XI and subs. We had several players who were just back from injury and if not for them we would've been in even more trouble. (Even though Sturridge and Lucas didn't contribute much)

&gt; As someone else said, a couple of decent first teamers in to raise the level and those players like Markovic become valuable contributors to the team.

But we have too many players that are like Markovic. They will become valuable contributors of the team but for now they can give you only about one or two months worth of performances that really contribute. Other than that, they only fill the numbers. Markovic, Moreno, and even Coutinho, Can and Sterling all are inconsistent and you can't expect consistent performances from them. 

I would say that only Skrtel has been quite consistent over the season. Others have given us couple of great months, some less. 

If you compare it to Arsenal team who have Sanchez, Özil (even when he's ""shit"", he still has his technique, vision and touch), Giroud, Ramsey, Koscielny, Mertesacker then it's a stark contrast, and that's only their stand-out starting players. They might not be that far ahead of us in the league but in terms of the consistency of quality across the team is much higher than ours. We have quite a long way to reach that level. 

I fear our team is too inexperienced. How will we cope with losing the (almost) last experience that we have? Gerrard, Johnson, Toure, Enrique, Lambert, even Balotelli. Well, some of them don't contribute much, but what the hell will happen to our average age? I just can't see past another transitional season...

Since Rangers haven't been playing in Europe, and therefore not contributing further to the coefficient, it has stabilised. A simple look at the evidence you provided shows that. The correlation is NOT there, despite your increasingly weak arguments to the contrary.

I think you are statistically illiterate. You don't understand the concept of correlation but continue to argue about it.

You're right, there does seem to be a stabilisation around 23rd/24th place, but all this shows is what happens when only Celtic are contributing. When Rangers and Celtic both contribute, we fluctuate around 15th position, which is why historically we normally have two Champions League places up for grabs.

There were two major events that contribute to the year on year drop you speak of. The first is Rangers Uefa Cup run in 2007/8  + Celtic and Rangers both making the last 16 of the champions league beforehand. That was an abnormally successful period for Scottish clubs in Europe.  A ""correction"" follows where  we drop to 15th and then 18th. What happened after that was another abnormal event that began with Craig Whyte. Rangers had a poor season in Europe and haven't had a chance to play in it since. This is why Scottish football finds itself in its  abnormal position in the 20s.   You can say its stabilised, but I'd argue we are actually in the bust of a boom-bust cycle.

null,false,Mordisquitos,null,null,null,"&gt;You can check out the evidence of the OKC bombing, and clearly the 'official story' is a massive lie, there is no way a single fertilizer bomb could take out the girders that caused the carnage seen on that date.

I have a very big issue with this kind of argument, which is in the same vein as _""Jet fuel can't melt steel beams""_ and _""Lee Harvey Oswald could not have scored that shot at that distance with that rifle""_.

Say you are one of the guys actually planning the conspiracy (OKC bombing, 9/11, JFK assasination). You want to get the job done but, even more importantly, you want to make sure nobody realises it was an inside job. Now, if you knew beforehand that fertilizer won't destroy the building, that jet fuel won't melt steel beams, or that Lee Harvey Oswald will never make that shot, **why on earth would you take the risk of everyone else coming to the same conclusion**?

Just _give Tim McVeigh high explosives_ and come up with a good backstory as to how he got his hands on them; if jet fuel won't melt the beams, _just hope three jets crashing into the WTC and the Pentagon will be traumatic enough_; if Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle or position is shit, _give him a better rifle and place him on the grassy knoll_.

Why go to all the trouble of making the plan literally twice as complex and take such a huge risk by staging an ""official"" cause for the events and a covered up ""secret"" explanation? Hell, just make the official explanation do the job.

It's a great way for the show to continue to stay fresh even though it's been on the air so long. 

The version you are watching right now is Christopher Eccleston, he's the 9th Doctor, most people start with nine because unless you grew up with the classic Doctor Who stuff it's campy and hard to watch.

The problem with the current season you are on is that Russell Davis the show runner at that time was a bit childish. Once Moffat takes over it gets far more serious.

No, I mean ridiculous. Like trying to create a made up definition of what it means to be British which includes wanting mass immigration, despite the polling evidence showing that the vast, vast majority of British citizens want a cut in immigration.

&gt;So that does not automatically mean they all support UKIP view on doing it

You cannot cut immigration without leaving the European Union, so if they want to cut it then they have no choice but to leave the EU. Farage was rated **by far** as the leader who performed the best on the issue of immigration in the debate the other day. I think it's safe to say that a significant portion of that 77% agree with UKIP's policies on the issue.

No, they were emotional nonsense surrounding some definition of Britishness you plucked out of thin air.

What you're doing is taking where you think we should be and comparing to that.  Therefore, you're not actually wrong.  But it's not the fair comparison and in fact hurts your case.

What I'm doing is the fairer and better comparison.  Directly comparing where we were, not at our highest or where I think we should be, but where we actually were the last time Rangers contributed new results to the coefficient to where we are now.

This then gives us the true reflection on Scotlands coefficient compared to when Rangers were adding new results to it.  That doesn't show the effect you seem to think it does.  In fact, it shows the complete opposite.  When Rangers were adding new results to the coefficient it dropped year on year.  Since then, our coefficient hasn't increased (which, in fact, is the argument you are trying to make, it's just you're getting the terms mixed up) but it shows absolutely no decline.

I also think we're diverging on our definition of consistently.

Dortmund are never going to be anything more than the odd really good league season. They'll never be Munich's equals for a length of time.

Bielsa has consistently made average teams perform better. But the gas runs out after one and a bit seasons. I don't think he's made a team perform to the levels we did last season, and then he's never really maintained that level.

Simeone had one awesome out of this world season. But isn't third, their average finish otherwise, really just about where Atletico should be? Look at the money they've spent this season.

null,false,grelch,null,null,null,"1. We all weren't beating that ridiculous drum. In fact some of us, ok I was saying right at the beginning of December, that we would be bang in the middle of the table come March. And guess what, you can in fact get to 3rd in the table with average players. We did it. Albion did something similar a few years back. Even Burnley were near the top of the table for a long period last time they were in the prem. It was fun to celebrate. It was worth celebrating. But people started talking about the Champion's League. Seriously? You know when you get to talk about Champion's League? When the season is over and you've qualified, not when there's 6 months to go and the dog days of winter still ahead of you. Instead we set utterly ridiculous standards for our club in December and started ripping our hair out when it started to slip away. It's the behavior of people who created a false level of expectation and subsequently created a ridiculous level of entitlement when the team couldn't do what you wanted them to.

2. At no point did I say ""Oh well, shit happens."" I'm not rationalizing a bloody thing. I'm telling you what's happening. An average, maybe slightly better than average side, having played excellent football (while other sides started their seasons poorly) for the first half of the season is now and has been struggling for form since December, after a series of debilitating injuries to the squad (while other sides have found their form). And guess what, it isn't going to get any easier until the end. With all of that, our players are exerting themselves. There's still team unity and spirit. They're still playing for the manager. So, I'll say it again, if you want to crucify our players for not being able to do what you think they should, even though they're trying to do it for you, then have at it. You're ENTITLED. 

We're safe. We've got some young players who have huge potential. We have some average to good players who could be very good if we bring in better players. If in the offseason we are somehow able to bring in better than average players in numbers, then we will have a legitimate Europa League side. I'm choosing to celebrate our fantastic first half of the season, to SUPPORT our lads as they continue to work hard, and am excited about what we may be in store for next season. We're exactly where our board planned to be at this point in time. I will not, will not crucify our players when they're working their asses off because I think I'm entitled to top shelf product, a shitload of goals and an easy win against one of the toughest sides in the league who are fighting for their lives.

Lastly, don't presume that I don't care ""a lot"" about West Ham. I went to my first match in 1973 and have worn my heart on my sleeve for the claret and blue for 43 years. I've seen us run the whole gamut, the whole fucking gamut. If you'd take one step back and had a look at what's going on, the big picture, then you'd remember why you should be optimistic.

You keep making your opinion up on the fly. You started from not understanding how the coefficients are calculated (the 5 year thing), and being mistaken on Scottish team's results in Europe. At each turn you have challenged my position (called me a liar) whilst changing yours.

&gt; Ahhhh, just worked it out.

No you didn't. You thought about it for a couple of minutes and tried to reinterpret the facts from the whole conversation to suit your world view.

&gt; You're using a false correlation. 

This is getting ridiculous. 

You can literally open up Excel or any other statistics engine right now and work out the correlation - you can even pick any time scale you like.  

You will get a number which shows that Scotland's coefficient is positively correlated with Rangers ability to perform in Europe. Rangers do well in Europe - it goes up. Rangers do bad in Europe or don't appear in it, it goes down.

Any other Scottish team will have either zero correlation (those that never play in it) or  a small but negligible correlation because they don't get past the group stages of either competition.  Whether you like it or not, Rangers are still Scotland's second highest contributor to Scotland's European coefficient, despite being out of the top flight for the past 3 years. 

To be more specific - in that one year Rangers played in Europe before Craig Whyte took over, the have still done more for the coefficient than any other club since, bar Celtic.

&gt; What I'm doing is the fairer and better comparison. Directly comparing where we were, not at our highest or where I think we should be, but where we actually were the last time Rangers contributed new results to the coefficient to where we are now.

Lol, its not about choosing a fair comparison when you can use at objective facts. Look at [this table](http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html) and filter it on Scottish clubs.  Rangers have the second highest contributions to Scottish coefficient points TODAY.

By definition, Rangers being second means that even TODAY they are still contributing more to the coefficient than any other club bar Celtic. In fact they are still contributing more points than the next two Scottish clubs combined. That is actually astonishing considering they haven't been in the top flight for 3 years. Are you still going to argue that:

&gt; Performance in Europe is about the same as it was when Rangers were in the SPL

EDIT:

You made an error about Celtic's results in Europe, and called me a liar whilst making that error.  You then changed our comment when you realised you were wrong.  There's nothing wrong with correcting your comment except from the fact you were in the wrong whilst claiming I was a liar.

I'm probably going to stop replying to you though because I think your showing strong cognitive dissonance to the facts. You are clearly set in your way and I'm happy to let you continue to believe:

 &gt; Performance in Europe is about the same as it was when Rangers were in the SPL

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"Well, perhaps what makes it different is that Islamism (i.e. political Islam) is a theologically-fascist ideology, in direct opposition to Western secular values.  

By all means let Islamists have the freedom of speech, but the flip-side of that is that journalists have the freedom to let everyone know what they're doing.

Oh and as for your moan about the Jewish lobby. I'm not the biggest supporter of current Israeli policy, but here's the thing - Jewish people have been a massive net benefit to the West in ways that Muslims haven't.  

Edit II:  /u/damir33 just PM'd me to say - 

&gt;You're one of the most ignorant people I've ever had the displeasure of coming across on this website. You talk about Muslims in science like it's an entirely black and white affair, that all Muslims have immediate access to education and universities and science, which they don't. Jews can generally be found in western nations such as the UK or the USA and in USA-funded Israel, hence it is obviously easier to get into science for them. A huge percentage of Muslims live in absolute poverty.

I told the poster to have the guts to comment on this page instead of using PMs and this was /u/damir33's response

&gt;How about you reply, you fucking Nazi scum?

Edit III:   /u/damir33 just sent me yet another PM

Thought we were kind of slow out the gate except Hazard and Remy. Hazard has apparently been listening to all of our prayers and was letting the shots fly. Remy likewise looked eager to score and make a good impression out of the start.

Oscar was in and out. Seems to do best when he really focuses on occupying that space between the midfield and defensive lines. I think he runs into trouble when he drifts too far forward and clogs himself and probably the worst backline to do that against is Stoke.

The Costa injury is real worrisome. Especially as we looked totally ineffective with just Drogba out there.

Willian seemed to really relish that spell he got playing between Cuadrado and Hazard and I would love to see us start off a match and play at least 60-70 minutes like that with those 3 - seems like it could be an absolutely venomous trio.

I really like how he's not afraid to shoot, and that attitude he had seemed to resonate with the whole team, we were a lot more direct today then I've seen in a long long time. The 2nd half was probably the best half we've played in a long time as well. 

Other thoughts are that Cuadrado isn't going to have much of an effect for us the rest of the year. I really like how hard he's trying, but he just hasn't adapted to how brutally aggressive and physical Premier League defenders are. I'm actually glad that he came on and got some extended minutes and experience against the team that embodies the difference between the PL and other leagues like Stoke does. 

Also, I wish some of our more outspoken fans would get off the back of Oscar. Yeah ok, he missed a sitter, but outside of that, what else did he do that was so poor? Nothing. A lot of what Oscar does for the team isn't sexy, and yet everybody is so quick to shit on him when something goes wrong. His pressing is always key to us retaining the ball, and his passes/layoffs today were fine. So yeah, he didn't play great, but he wasn't awful either. Also, playing average for 3 months does NOT mean you should get sold. 

I'm not worried that Costa is going to be out for awhile with the hamstring injury, because Remy has clearly proved himself to be an adequate replacement. Although I think it was a foolish move to bring Costa on and risk him knowing that hamstring injuries can be re-aggravated.

Scottish football is worse off in Europe without Rangers.

What do you mean we're not?  Here's a table proving it.

But, but, ignore THAT, here's how the coefficient works.

But, but, muh coefficient and how it works!

Never mind that, here's the real comparison!

Ha!  You got this wrong!  Apologise and admit you're wrong!

Oh, you caught it.  Well, you're still wrong, and here's why even though you're not wrong!

Here's your comparison:

Aberdeen are having a bad season.  Why?  In 1982-83, we won the Scottish Cup and the Cup Winners Cup.  This season we didn't.  Therefore we're having a bad season.

Is this fact?  Yes (though you'd have to substitute the Cup Winners Cup with the Europa League).  Is it true?

Well, no.

Because, although it's factual, the comparison is false.  It's false and a lie to compare Aberdeen this season to us at our best.  Here's the true comparison:

This season Aberdeen are doing OK.  Compared to last season, we haven't won any trophies but we're virtually guaranteed second and were top of the league for a while.  So, OK.

See?  You can try confusing things all you want, but the truth is that you are comparing where you think we should be, where we are, saying it's worse and then saying that's purely down to the lack of Rangers.  The proper comparison, the true one, is where we were the last time Rangers contributed new results to where we are  and where we are now.  Any other comparison is false.

And the truth is that we are no better or worse off than we were in the last season Rangers contributed new results to the coefficient.  Which your table proves.  It's become clear that you know absolutely nothing about correlation or statistics except how to bend them how you want and trying to bluff your way out when people call you on your lies.

I guess to be positive I'd like to remind people how well we played in the first 10 minutes. I'm not sure why we can't keep that up. Lots of one touch, well placed balls. 

I also disagree that Long can't fit on the right wing. I thought he had several good crosses. He was composed, looking up and choosing his spots instead of just booting it in, which I think Tadić has been doing lately. He also hustles, and rushes back and tries to make tackles from behind effectively, or at least trap the player between him and Wanyama.  

Speaking of, Wanyama is such a beast. People just bounce off of him, I really hope we can keep him, almost more so than Toby. I think Yoshida played excellent earlier during out player draught. Obviously want to keep both, but I'm feeling like Wanyama and Schneiderlin out of our midfield would suck big monkey balls. 

Elia did absolutely nothing at all. Honestly how does Mane not get the start? Only thing I can think of is that Koeman loves the bum rush he gives the opposition in a tired 2nd half.

null,false,cos,null,null,null,"This is an illusion.  In the UK, parties have enough control over who their candidates for office are, that you can think of a party as a coherent group in government.  If you want to participate in governing from a different direction or with a different view, you can try it as another party, but FPTP makes it very hard for additional parties.  The system is thus pretty closed.

In the US, voting is also FPTP, but the difference is that parties  have little to no control over who runs in primaries, and who votes in primaries.  Party organizations often have a lot of influence over who *wins* primaries, but they have to do that by campaigning and winning votes from the public.

If you want to be, say, the Democratic nominee for Congress from your district, you don't need the support or approval of any party leader or active Democratic member or committee.  You just need to collect enough signatures from registered voters who say they're Democrats (even if they never have any involvement with the party at all), and put your name on the ballot as a Democrat.  If you can get more votes in the primary than anyone else who did the same thing, then you're the Democratic candidate for Congress from your district, and you run against the Republican and any others in the general election.  And in most states, it's very easy for each voter to choose which party's primary to vote in, and to pick different parties in different elections.  In a lot of states it's as simple as going to the polls and telling them ""I'd like a Republican ballot"" or ""I'd like a Democratic ballot"" on primary election day.

Because of this, it happens pretty often (at the state level) and not too infrequently (at the federal level) that people win office and serve as legislators or Governors who were *not* the choice of the leaders or party organizations.  Yes, in most cases, only a Democratic or Republican nominee has a chance of winning office, but what it *means* to be a party nominee is very very different in the US than in the UK.  It means the candidate has chosen to label themselves as that party, *not* that the party has put them forward as its candidate.

What this means is that the system is open to a variety of different movements to compete with each other within the supposed two-party system, in the way that the UK's politics are not.  Many candidates who, in other countries, would be a third (or fourth or fifth or etc.) party, in the US simply choose to run as Democrats or Republicans because that's how they can have a chance to win.  If they'd have had enough support to form a successful alternate party under a different election system, then they have enough support to get a bunch of their allies elected within the two party system, even though they're not a ""party"".

The US and UK party systems are very very different, and the US's is much closer to proportional systems in its openness than it is to the UK's much more closed system.  Restricted primaries are what make the difference.  The biggest ""flaw"" in the US system's openness is the majority of people who don't vote in primaries most of the time.  That's not an inherent part of the election system, that's due to the disengagement of the public from politics (which is partly due to other aspects of the system, such as the role of money and how people become cynical because of it).",null,0,null,1428174244,null,0,false,0,cq16n01,null,t3_2wur7z,null,t1_cq16n01,null,t1_cp5vlx9,null,null,null,1432195411,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

This is why Liverpool looks great against the lower ranked teams, but get exposed against top teams, or highly motivated and organised teams in competitions.  

If you want to play possession based football, you need short, accurate passes, players moving forward dynamically, and players that can cycle around the field.  If you don't have those dynamic players, you do better with a strait up counter offensive style, and if you don't have the defence and speed, you hoof it down the field and have someone hold it up, then play along the wings and load up the box with players.

I think Rodgers definitely is okay with the CBs passing to each other some of the time to draw the other team up, but the amount we did it at the beginning of the season (worst offence being against Villa at home) is unlikely to be part of the plan. In the back 3 we have wider CBs that have a bit more licence to move up and take some risks since Skrtel is back there, but when we only had 2 they were more cautious in their passing. Skrtel himself is really bad for only taking the safe option, but in the back 3 that actually is fine since we don't need him to make those passes since Can and Sakho can do it, he just needs to anchor and not give up the ball.

Not really sure where I was going with this at the end, but I think how Stevie was playing at the beginning of the year is similar in style to how Xavi played with Barcelona during the Pep years, but way less effective in creating space and just overall nowhere near the quality, but it's not like when we were passing it around in the back that Stevie didn't ever get involved.",null,0,null,1428175097,null,0,false,0,cq172t4,null,t3_31f1eb,null,t1_cq172t4,null,t1_cq11j9u,null,null,null,1432195616,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Normal static [GATSOs](http://www.speedcamerasuk.com/gatso.htm) and [SpeedCurbs](http://www.speedcamerasuk.com/speedcurb.htm) have one, rear facing camera. You will frequently see these with one unit placed on each side of the road - to catch traffic moving away from them. They use either ground induction loops or some form of radar to judge your speed. Not relevant to your situation, but good to know nonetheless.

Mobile camera units are rumoured to have both front, side and rear facing cameras. However, the geometry of the terrain around them is very important. If you are on a hill, the unit is much more likely to be setup capturing motorists going *down* the hill than up. There is, as far as I know, no definitive answer to which units operate all three camera orientations and in which constabularies - so I'm not sure you will find a very trustworthy answer online.

I sympathize dude. As a recent post of mine recently shown, I was/am very anxious about speeding tickets. It's a horrible feeling and I hope you didn't come acropper.

Suarez was one who would still play with one leg to win or go down fighting.  We need someone with this mentality.  These qualities really show up when they play on field.  

I can't remember,  but most of our wins are when we are ahead.  We completely lack that fight when we  concede.  We rarely show up when chips are down. I hope we sign someone who can help team to not give up!

£1500 for a roadworthy 250cc, A2 license, tax, insurance and gear is extremely tight in my view. Others may say different, but having been 12 months in the saddle now with an A2, riding a 600cc Honda, it definitely isn't so cheap.

You *can* spend £1000 on a 250cc bike and it will be fine. I would hesitate at anything less than £1000 as, in my experience, bikes upwards of £1000 tend to be a bit tidier and better looked after. I bought my first 125cc for £1600 and it was a great buy. If it's to be relied upon you would want it to be tidy, well looked after and well maintained. For less than £1k, you might struggle there - especially buying from a dealer (which I would recommend, especially for a first bike, as you get a 3/6/12 month warranty very often).

Gear, you can spend anywhere from £30 to £400 on a pair of boots - and that's just one of the necessaries. That goes for all of the gear really, there are vast expanses in what you can expect to pay for it. My first helmet cost me £30, my second (and current) helmet cost me £90. I found my first helmet was too heavy, too noisy and didn't have enough features for my liking so I invested in another. My helmet sits on my melon for over 2 hours a day, so it's fairly important to me!

Insurance, for me with 0 years NCB (will soon be 1 year!) on a 600cc with a full, untarnished A2 license is £1200 fully comp for the year (£400 compulsory excess, £0 voluntary). That will drop to roughly £700 with my 1 years NCB and probably down to ~£350 with 2 years. For a 250cc I'm not sure what it would top out at, but expect figures to be slightly less as you'll be on a smaller bike.

A2 license, it cost me roughly £600 to do my A2 all in. That was with 10 months riding on a CBT every day in quiet, moderate and very busy traffic. Without my CBT experience, I would have spent more than the £600 I would almost guarantee.

Bottom line, if you're going to rely on her to commute every day - come rain or shine, to reliably start in the morning and get you back in the evening - you're going to want quality gear and a fairly tidy bike. Anything less and you will suffer, either from the hassle of getting cold, damp and wet from the elements or having to constantly fix the poor bike when it goes wrong. *In my view*. I've been an all season, all weather biker doing 40 miles a day, split between a 125cc and a 600cc for 12 months and honestly, good gear and good bike you won't go far wrong.",null,0,null,1428176258,null,0,1428176439,0,cq17og9,null,t3_31g32u,null,t1_cq17og9,null,t3_31g32u,null,null,null,1432195900,null,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

Our second place finish really didn't do us any favors because it raised the level of expectation much higher than it really should have for this season.

I think our place in the table accurately reflects who we are: Young, exciting, inexperienced, incomplete. A team capable of looking fantastic against weaker clubs but struggle with the teams ahead of us.

Of course, Sturridge's absence this season has certainly not helped either.

The process will be much slower. But there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic. FSG are **not** H&amp;G. FSG will make stadium expansion happen. And while our the pieces of our first team seems to stumble, I actually think we're quite close to being a complete team.

Well, you could start off by looking at the number of science nobel prizes have been won by Muslims. I believe it's two - [and one of those two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam) was considered the wrong type of Muslim by his nation of birth and so would have faced persecution had he not moved to the UK.

As for music and arts - it's not even clear that 'good' muslims are allowed to participate freely in such endeavors.  And where are the famous muslim novelists?  

I do accept that there are many muslim professionals, but I think that Islam has massively held back the development of an intellectual tradition, which as I said before, is something I consider to be a *tragedy*.

If you need to do an SA return you may need to keep some money aside for the tax. If you chose to get taxed through a PAYE code. It would be taxed against any wages you had. Either way, you need to declare an accurate reflection of your income.

For tax purposes you would need receipts, et al, only if you were investigated by compliance officers. What you do with your money is your business, but if you were using the money for non-business related activity you wouldn't be able to claim expenses for those payments. However, you would still need to declare that income as revenue and profit.

Eg:  someone gives you £60 for walking their dog. You use £10 to buy a lead. Your revenue is £60 but your profit is £50. However, if you used £10 of that money to buy a couple of pints down the pub your revenue is still £60 and the profit is still £50. 

You really don't want to ever get into the situation where you use funds generated by the business for personal expenses before getting some record like a bank deposit. People get caught out by this when they work cash in hand. For example, they pay £200 a week into their business account. However they were given £250 for a job and were using £50 on their weekly food shop. So at the end of the hear they can't be arsed looking through their receipts and just check the bank statements. They declare that money, but HMRC send then a letter stating they are under investigation for tax fraud. They show up, check the receipts and ask ""you havent been declaring a fifth of your revenue"".

null,false,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"You're being disingenuous.

You're claim:

&gt; No, no, no. See, here's your position throughout this thing:
&gt; Scottish football is worse off in Europe without Rangers.

What I actually said:

&gt; Relative to itself, Scottish football is probably doing better since Rangers dropped down the divisions with it being more competitive and a lot of teams shedding debt.
&gt;
&gt; However, relative to other leagues around Europe and further abroad, which are mostly growing at a phenomenal rate, Scottish football has suffered since Rangers dropped down the divisions. If we really care about Scottish football then we have to acknowledge that TV money, performance in Europe and attracting an international audience is essential for growth of the league. 

I notice you have dropped your TV argument. Perhaps this was a concession that I had a point. You're main seems to be with the European football performances.

&gt;  Here's a table proving it. But, but, ignore THAT, here's how the coefficient works.

I posted the table, and haven't changed my point since posting it. 

You replied. 

From your reply it was clear that you didn't understand what the table was saying so I brought to your attention that each year's rank also depends on the 4 previous years. This seemed to change your understanding as you say:

&gt; Over 5 years, right?

Then go on to change your point based on your new understanding.

&gt; Never mind that, here's the real comparison!

I've not changed any ""comparison"". The data is that data. When examining data there are standard metrics you should always look at to understand it.  You look for anomalies which might look like maxima and minima, and you try and understand why they occur.

I identified 2006-2008 when we were 10th as a maximum, gave a reason why it was a maximum and why it was better performance than normal.

I identified the current rank hovering around 23rd/24th as a minimum.

With this swing from maximum to minimum I identified that Rangers performance in Europe matches this swing i.e. they are correlated.  

This has always been my point and every source of data I've quoted reflects this!

I've already shown you the data that says Rangers last European games are still contributing more to the coefficient than any other Scottish team, bar Celtic's, has since. It seems that this continues to go over your head.

&gt; And the truth is that we are no better or worse off than we were in the last season Rangers contributed new results to the coefficient.

This statement is wrong and still doesn't seem to include the fact that points contributions last a 5 year period. 

If you're referring to the last time Rangers made a winning contribution, that was 2010-11. At the end of that season the coefficient was 15th.

If you're referring to the last time Rangers played in Europe, that was 2011-2012. At the end of this season the coefficient was 18th.

The next year it dropped to 24th. Either way, the statement you made is wrong.

Your analogy with Aberdeen in 1982-3 is ludicrous. When you are examining time series data the dates need to be consecutive.",null,0,null,1428177238,null,0,false,0,cq18749,null,t3_319c4f,null,t1_cq18749,null,t1_cq16179,null,null,null,1432196145,null,1,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1,null

It doesn't matter that the golden age started a 1000 years ago - it was instrumental to those great jewish achievements you have cited this past century.

Or perhaps the fall of Islamic science is due to many differrent factors, such as: a history of structural violence, civil war, poverty, poor infrastructure (ie schools), collapse of the Ottomon Empire after WWI, multiple foriegn invasions, theft of natural resources, autocratic rulers (some put in place by us), geopolitics..... the list goes on.

Likewise you cannot claim an expense for which you have no receipt otherwise you could reduce your profits, and thereby taxes payable, to nil, just by making up expenses.

Did Islam really pave the way for everyone else?  Not really.  I think that some intellectuals who happened to be muslims made some contributions 1000 years ago.

Their contributions are just one of many steps taken during the ascent of man. Again, I mentioned the Greeks and their influence on those Islamic thinkers. I also mentioned the Egyptians and Sumerian's who influenced the Greeks. I'm not living in the past, I'm putting current events into a historical narrative. I'm giving perspective. 

&gt; Anyway, this was a long time ago and before the Enlightenment which transformed the West, and after which, Islam was soon left in the dust, unable to compete in the knowledge-production game.

Again, you're preaching separatism, which only serves to satisfy your ego. The European enlightenment was a monumental step in the ascent of man, but there have been many others that came before it. 

My point is that there are many educated Muslims, past and present, that have made monumental contributions to mankind's understanding of the cosmos. To belittle that is simply disrespectful and shows a complete lack of actual historical knowledge.

null,false,VettelS,null,null,null,"&gt; 1) you don't think little Johnny will borrow his dad's credit card or just use the porn account his dad is already logged into?

Of course, this sort of system would not be infallible; and of course, a parent could easily give their child the means to circumvent the restriction, either deliberately or accidentally. If a parent deliberately allows their child to access pornography, there's nothing you can do about that; it's a judgement call by the parent that we can debate endlessly. If a parent allows their child to borrow their debit card under false pretences, or allows their child to use their account, then I'd question their ability to be a parent - in the same way that you occasionally see stories of a child running up a bill of hundreds of pounds in some iPad game, on their parent's debit card; the child's either been deceitful or ignorant, but the parent's just been stupid.

&gt; 2) blocking individual imgur links.. how's that work?

This isn't for the government to do - you place the responsibility on the website owner, and they work out how to do it. I agree that having some sort of government-run filter to automatically block pornographic images from minors isn't a viable solution - instead you pass legislation that requires website owners to implement this themselves. And as the article says, websites that fail to comply get blocked at ISP-level - in the same way that various bittorrent directory websites are currently dealt with.

&gt; or stopping kids passing around usb sticks.. how's that work?

You can't, obviously. This proposal is concerned only with access to online material, in any case.

&gt; if you try to catch images you get into weird territory like charging kids with holding indecent underage images of themselves. (side note: you want authorities looking through pictures your kids take? because ultimately that could be where this leads). there is no quick technical fix for this.

You wouldn't make the possession of pornographic material by a minor illegal - just as it isn't currently. The proposed legislation isn't concerned with possession, but instead the (wilful) supply of pornographic material to minors.

&gt; 3) fair point, but i'd say the porn use is more a symptom, not the root problem. educate parents how to parent, educate kids about porn. blanket blocking material not only doesn't work, it's incompatible with living in a free country.

Yes, I agree that it's a symptom rather than a problem, but I don't think that it's a symptom of lack of education. Parents know that their children can easily access pornography via the family computer or their smartphone; the reason that they don't attempt to prevent it is because they don't care, or at least not enough to do anything about it. A parent who doesn't want their children accessing porn will use filtering software at home, places the family computer in a communal area and not buy them a smartphone. It wouldn't be foolproof, of course - but it would at least be a deterrent. Parents in this day and age know that pornography is rife on the Internet, and they know how easy it is to access.",null,0,null,1428178882,null,0,false,0,cq192pm,null,t3_31dzhk,null,t1_cq192pm,null,t1_cq177cv,null,null,null,1432196558,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

In reality its true Ki has played at a top 4 level this season, however midfield is a position with tons of options. In my opinion Ki could become a future captain at Swansea if he stayed, whereas he'd likely not be more than a squad player at a bigger club.

I don't have my ear too close to Liberty, but it seems Ki is happy here and he's a hero to the fans. I could be naïve, but I don't see him pushing for a transfer under Monk. 

All this said, if we recieved a £20 million pound offer we'd have to do more than consider it. However, I'm quietly optimistic he's going to be with us for awhile. I mean Ashley Williams could start in the middle for several champions league teams IMO and has warranted interest from Arsenal in the past, however he hasnt even hinted at leaving.

Ahem. Three million? Are you seriously saying that mass surveillance of the British population was because the security services honestly thought that one in twenty people in the UK was somehow influenced by the Soviet Union? They might have been somewhat crazy, but surely they weren't THAT crazy. 

&gt;I'm not sure what your point is, other than that people of potential interest to the state had files kept on them by the state?

The point is that if a whole 5% of the population was being kept tabs on by the state in the 1980s, when that was a lot harder to do, then it is surely ridiculous that today's security services would consider keeping tabs on the SNP a waste of time. Someone I was replying to actually said that.

&gt;I'm willing to bet however, that they tapped the phones because the miners were receiving cash direct from the Soviet Union, with the direct sanction of the politburo.

And you're wrong. Even Margaret Thatcher had to concede that Scargill couldn't be shown to be a Soviet stooge (the money came from Soviet Trade Unions by the way, not direct from the government, though obviously those Unions would be following the Communist Party line). At the time Scargill was the most watched man in the free world - and they couldn't find any evidence at all that he was up to anything illegal or under foreign government influence.

MI5 famously had Scargill down as an 'unaffiliated subversive' - his very own classification. And that was because he wasn't taking orders or in the pay of anyone. And they couldn't find any lawbreaking or evidence of foreign subversion on the NUM either - that was why the Thatcher government had to set up the Public Order Intelligence Unit, a police unit designed to infiltrate legal organizations who weren't criminals and who weren't being run by foreign governments, or considered 'subversive', and who were therefore falling outwith the remit of CID and Special Branch. Basically they wanted a way of having police spy on political activists, presumably because MI5 was running out of manpower.

Point is, nobody in the British government thought the Miners were part of any Soviet-run plot, so I don't see why you should.

Um.  What can I say?  I happen to have a PhD in physics and as far as I'm aware, there really hasn't been a proportionate muslim contribution to 20th or 21st century physics.  And that seems to be confirmed by the *tiny* number of nobel prizes awarded to muslim scientists.  Sure there are *some* good muslim scientists, generally working at Western institutions, but given how large the Islamic population is, one  would expect there to be many many more.

And there's certainly *no* comparison to the number of jewish scientists.  Good god, to a first approximation, physics is practically a Jewish profession given the size of their contribution.  (Yes I'm exaggerating, but not by much.)

No, not really. I think (what's left of) Scottish Labour would suffer more than the SNP as a result of that scenario.

The thinking would be that Scotland voted Labour last time and got the Conservatives, Scotland voted SNP this time and got the Conservatives, so if the rest of the UK is what really determines the UK government then why shouldn't Scotland simply vote for the party they feel best represents their interests within the UK?

The simple explanation for that is the ""you can only vote for the Conservatives or Labour or you've wasted your vote"" idea is pretty much dead in Scotland.

bare in mind, you could pay insurance monthly. remember you don't need a new bike.

heres also a breakdown of costs for the a2 http://www.visordown.com/learners/how-much-does-an-a2-motorcycle-licence-cost/23236.html
