The chances are you need to find your local street services. If you want to PM me where you are I can possibly look it up for you (I have been working in homeless services for the last few years). 

Do go into the council, they control emergency accomodation. The downside of this is there's not much choice and it's not very nice. You may not get any or it may be in a different town away from your college. Street services will be contracted by the council and are much better at advice, however the council get the last say so you need to speak to both. 

There may be a number of local homeless hostels, wrth looking at, not what people assume. Again, I may be able to help if you need. 

Street services in some areas can only refer you for housing if they find you rough sleeping at least three times. This sounds terrible, and does mean sofa surfing can slow your chances, but in reality what you need to do is talk to them, find out when they patrol, and get up early and sit outside three mornings in a row.

To get more tax out of companies without them running away requires (to my mind) a global tax setup, where a company has to carry on paying the local country tax rates for (say) ten years *after they've left*.

Gaussian's have a variance parameter, sigma (squared) -- so all you've done is define that as a 3 sigma change, so that doesn't demonstrate anything -- effectively you've made up some numbers.  Please tell me the equation for the Guassian you've used to work out this ""95%"" confidence, and where you got the two parameters -- mean and variance from.

&gt; Having an extremely large sample is good for statistics. The fact that it's small fraction isn't that important, so long as there are actually enough of the events you care about in it. Obviously what you actually want to do is look at the time series year on year rather than comparing two years explicitly, but it's wrong to say that those two years make it look insignificant.

Except this isn't a large sample.  There are only two numbers in this particular series.  We're not talking about the statistics of the population, we're talking about the statistics of the number of suicides per year.  Since we only get one sample per year, that's a very small number.

The 95% confidence for those figures is completely irrelevant, since we're not talking about confidence in those numbers themselves, we're talking about whether the change is significant in terms of being able to jump to conclusions about society -- and there is absolutely no way you can be 95% confident about anything you have only got 10 or so samples of.  Jeez -- statisticians rule of thumb is that you need 10 for a mean; 100 for a standard deviation; 1000 for a skew, and 10000 for kurtosis.  Since ""confidence"" comes from standard deviations, we would need a minimum of 100 years worth of data before we can start talking about whether any particular sample is outside any kind of Gaussian curve -- since we don't know the shape of that curve until we have a variance.

It even states in the report:

&gt; These form a confidence interval, which is a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and shows the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure.

So all they're saying is that they are 95% confident that they counted the number of suicides correctly -- well I was willing to let them have 100% confidence for that.  That has got nothing to do with my complaint.  (I also object to the idea that ""it's all in there"", when they don't say how they are calculating this confidence interval at all -- I've got no clue how they're calculating a confidence interval from a single data point -- the count; the only thing I can guess is that they do it by dividing the UK up into 100,000 blocks then treat each as ""a sample"" and measure the mean and variance of those -- but then it would still be absolutely irrelevant as to whether the change was significant or not).

Far too many people (and I'm not sure I would rule out the ONS) seem to be willing to throw around confidence interval figures as if they prove anything they like.

Lamela's issue isn't that he cuts inside, it's that he does so too early and too often. Lamela is not a left winger and he does not have the kind of pace you generally associate with wingers, but neither does Chadli. He has had games where he's been more diligent at staying wide and been tremendously effective there. 

But even as an inverted winger he'll never be the kind of player to blast through a defense with sheer speed. He's a much trickier player; we know that he's capable of dribbling past an opponent, picking out sick passes and even scoring goals that are absolutely, completely bonkers. 

Lamela's flaws are that he isn't quite there yet on a mental or tactical level. He's prone to indecisiveness and he *needs* to remember to stay out wide more often. From there he can both act almost like a wide playmaker *and* make clever runs into the box himself.

You're confusing the sample being the number of years with the sample being the number of suicides. Pure statistical noise would be applied to the number of suicides, not the number of years you fitted.

The tricky part is individualizing the contracts or setting them up in a manner that really allows incentives through bonuses, based on either statistics or some type of evaulation system. 

At the end of the day the outside market value really has to have the biggest say in what a player should get paid, which sucks in a way.  
Some random thoughts on contracts:

If I'm working in the front office of Chelsea, City, Arsenal or United I'm deliberately sending out rumors and gossip of interest in players like Raheem just to inflate competitors payrolls.  It's pretty obvious that modern football is a financial battle, and I think a lot of tactics that we normally wouldn't consider probably go on, possibly not to sinister lengths like this, but still.. could they? 

Consider then, how about the relationship between some of the top clubs across leagues?  You have to identify that clubs do have a loose partnership or relationship based on third party financial supporters, take the most obvious, kit designers.  When you get to that top world class player that can really become the face of a club, and make them a shit ton of money, you have to wonder how much some of the financial backers and these relationships shape the discussion, or even determine the outcome.  You're Real Madrid, you have interest in Sterling, but its not as serious as you'd really like to tell.  However, you're sponsored by Addidas, who also sponsers Chelsea, who wouldn't mind not facing Raheem twice a year..Or worse, you're Addidas and you wanted to make money off of Raheem through jersey sales, you save how ever much million by not bidding on LFC's kits and instead tell Chelsea or Real Madrid to go out and buy him.  You save a couple hundred million. 

I dunno, not saying thats exactly how it goes down but I mean you have oil gazillionares and media giants owning football clubs, the 20-30 thousand a week difference in player salary isn't really the driving force here, nor are the other players feelings.

That's simply the unpredictability of football: most of the other top teams in Europe have struggled with form at some point this season. Real Madrid looked unstoppable, winning 20+ in a row before a string of less amicable results tempered expectations a little bit; they look beatable now. Barcelona at the beginning of the season were written off by many; they've now clicked and are as dangerous as anybody else.

Football is always going to be volatile, results wise, but there's really no point to overreact at this point because we're struggling a bit for form; it's inherent in just about any club's case.

In my industry that figure is more like 20%. I'd be very wealthy if my company followed the same remuneration structure as a bank. But the company wouldn't last long, as most of that money not going out in salaries gets re-invested in R&amp;D, facilities, marketing etc. 

If my company paid out like a bank, they would render themselves nonviable. But, because banks dont have these cost overheads, they can get away with these hideously inflated remuneration packages.  

*Except they cant*, as we saw so spectacularly in 2008, when the wheels came off the whole system which needed billions of public money and is still being held in life support by ultra-accommodative central bank policies. 

I would suggest that the remuneration structure of a bank is equally as nonviable as it would be for a 'normal' company, but with a much longer and less predictable cycle to failure. Against this background, because bank failure is so costly to the taxpayer and the rest of the economy, it seems only sensible to force banks to restrain remuneration and to hold these funds as a buffer (or to reduce leverage to reduce exposure) against future risk of crises.

null,false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; The rule of thumb (standard error) for approximating something like this is 1 sigma = sqrt(N).

Except N in this case is 100,000, the population size.  Of which we have n postive samples.  In a tub of 1000 balls, if I select 100 and 1 is green, my estimate of standard error is not sqrt(1) it's sqrt(100).  Hence, in a population of 56 million, when I select 100,000 people and 246 of them commit suicide, the estimate of standard error is not sqrt(246), it's sqrt(100,000).  That being said, that is _not_ the way we [estimate standard error](http://www.statisticshowto.com/sigma-sqrt-n-used/) anyway.

So, just picking sqrt(N) as sigma is just plucking a number out of the air.  If sigma were always sqrt(N) we wouldn't need it as a parameter.

It's easy to see how nonsensical this ""rule of thumb"" is if we measured the same number as suicides-per-million and compare your method:

 - 246/100000 gives us a ""rule of thumb sigma"" of sqrt(246), which is 15.68
 - 2460/1000000 gives us a ""rule of thumb sigma"" of sqrt(2460), which is 49.5.

We're talking about the same statistic, so in the second case sigma would have to be ten times large simply because N is ten times larger.  But it isn't, so this rule of thumb is junk -- it would have us believe that if we measure in kg instead of stones the error bars are a different size.

&gt; You're confusing the sample being the number of years with the sample being the number of suicides. Pure statistical noise would be applied to the number of suicides, not the number of years you fitted.

Eh; I've not mentioned ""number of years""?  I'm saying that 246 -- which is our sample from 2013; and 295, which is our sample from 2014.  Now -- we're not talking about whether 246 is accurate, or 295 is accurate -- they are taken from a population of millions -- they're accurate, as evidenced by the the very small 95% confidence interval.  What we're talking about is whether 246 changing to 295 is signficant; and since we have only two samples in that series, the answer is -- we don't know.

If we had 10 samples, we wouldn't know, because 10 samples isn't enough either.  It's enough to calculate a mean, but not a standard deviation, and hence a confidence interval.

&gt; Think of it as a binning problem - you have suicides each as an individual data point, and we've made the decision to look at year-on-year rather than every six months (or every two years).

That makes my point even more strongly.  What if all the suicides happen in December/January and none in July?  We'd have an enourmous change in suicide level on a six-monthly basis, but not on a yearly basis.  But we don't know that until we've taken lots of samples to find out that it's always high in December/January and low in July.  You can't conclude anything from your two samples taken in one year.  Just as we can't conclude anything from two samples over two years.",null,0,null,1424724834,null,0,1424725599,0,coutbev,null,t3_2wv4zb,null,t1_coutbev,null,t1_courupp,null,null,null,1424760404,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Agreed.

But that's exactly what I said: our problem is not that the remuneration structure of the bank is nonviable -- it manifestly is viable as the banks still exist.  Our problem is that the reason it is viable is because government has pumped money into them, turning that which should be nonviable, viable.

The commentariat's solution seems to be to tell the banks to stop paying out in, what we find, an offensive way; my solution would be to stop making the nonviable viable by turning off the money pump.

In short: the object of our annoyance shouldn't be the banks, who are, after all, behaving entirely rationally by grabbing whatever money they can; the object of our annoyance should be government for propping them up.

&gt; Against this background, because bank failure is so costly to the taxpayer and the rest of the economy, it seems only sensible  to restrain remuneration

It seems only sensible to me to make bank failure _not_ so costly to the rest of the economy.  So: rather than whinge about banker bonuses, let's take an axe to the lot of them.  Let's start putting some proper reserve ratios in place rather than these, frankly ludicrous, levels we currently have (is it 3% in the UK?).  Let's start holding _somebody_ personally responsible when the taxpayer has to get his chequebook out.

&gt;It's easy to see how nonsensical this ""rule of thumb"" is if we measured the same number as suicides-per-million and compare your method:

&gt; * 246/100000 gives us a ""rule of thumb sigma"" of sqrt(246), which is 15.68
&gt;
&gt; * 2460/1000000 gives us a ""rule of thumb sigma"" of sqrt(2460), which is 49.5.

&gt;We're talking about the same statistic, so in the second case sigma would have to be ten times large simply because N is ten times larger.

What the fuck is this? You have more data, so you expect your uncertainty to go down. In this case, your relative uncertainty in the first case (1/sqrt(246)) is about 6%. Your relative uncertainty in the second case (1/sqrt(2460)) is about 2%. More data gives you smaller statistical errors. There is no absolutely no more obvious argument in statistics than this. How are you arguing with it?

&gt;Eh; I've not mentioned ""number of years""?

I know you haven't. That is because you don't understand what you're talking about. Suicides are not a random process where each year is assigned a random number of suicides. Any any given moment, each person either commits suicide or doesn't. Over a period of time, you can work out the expected numbers of suicides for any given suicide rate: you have a cumulative distribution function. Since this is just a counting experiment, you'd expect to get a Poisson distribution, for which the expected uncertainty is sqrt(N).

On top of this continuous distribution, *we* decide how to analyse the data, and we've decided to do it year-on-year. That is a completely arbitrary decision that we have made. For the purposes of modelling random processes, we don't have two observations. We have 541 events that we have put into two bins.

&gt;What if all the suicides happen in December/January and none in July? We'd have an enourmous change in suicide level on a six-monthly basis, but not on a yearly basis. But we don't know that until we've taken lots of samples to find out that it's always high in December/January and low in July. You can't conclude anything from your two samples taken in one year. Just as we can't conclude anything from two samples over two years.

Yes, you can. You can say how unlikely it is that there's no time variance at all. Obviously it's possible to hide a real pattern with your binning, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to calculate what your binned data implies.",null,0,null,1424726015,null,0,false,0,couu2ap,null,t3_2wv4zb,null,t1_couu2ap,null,t1_coutbev,null,null,null,1424760752,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Humans are sometimes violent and that has little to do with their faith and everything to do with the context of their life.  In fact Islamic Terrorist exists in several different situations that probably has quite distinct causes:

 * Alienated youth in rich countries who ""run amok"" (also seen in Christian school shootings).
 * Young people in war zones committing war crimes. (also seen in Christians in N Ireland, and Tamils in Sri Lanka).
 * Religiously motivated violence against minorities (also seen in Buddhist attacks on Muslims in Burma).

The causes of violence are complicated. You are taking semantic arguments and building a conspiracy theory out of them.  We all know there is a problem with Islamic Terrorism.

[Lord Drake's Bequest](http://harlequinmerlin.livejournal.com/1855.html) - Arthur is bequeathed a company under the condition that he get married and stay married for at least six months. It's a cheesy plot line but super cute and fun to read.

[Gadarene](http://archiveofourown.org/works/362891/chapters/589296) - Arthur is known as the mad prince of Camelot for reasons unknown to Merlin but he's about to find out. This is a bit of an angsty fic, sad parts but still good overall from what I remember. It's been awhile though.

[To You I Pledge](http://boxofmagic.talkoncorners.net/viewstory.php?sid=13&amp;warning=5) - Merlin magic reveal story, quite good. Some sad bits but nothing overwhelming. 

[Oh, What a Show](http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/165554.html) - Circus Camelot. CIRCUS Camelot. Need I say more? Read it! It's very fun.

[Fools of Us All](http://adelagia.livejournal.com/33016.html) - So Merlin accidentally makes everyone in Camelot fall in love with him except Arthur. Light hearted and sweet. 

[The Student Prince](http://archiveofourown.org/works/91885/chapters/125138?view_adult=true) - One of my favourites! Very long, modern AU where Arthur is Prince of Wales and Merlin goes to college with him and wacky hi-jinks ensue! Quite funny, quite sweet, very good read in my opinion. 

[We Pull These Jobs To Make A Little Money (No One Gets Hurt If They Don't Act Funny)](http://archiveofourown.org/works/502365) - Arthur and friends rob banks for a living, Merlin works at a bank. I think that's all the set up you need. :D

[The One Where Merlin Dances Ballet](http://misswinterhill.livejournal.com/52312.html) - Modern AU, Merlin takes ballet and Arthur plays football. Romance happens.

[The Tournament of Magicks](http://corilannam.livejournal.com/136113.html) - Merlin hears about a tournament for magic users and wants to join very badly, unbeknownst to him Arthur follows him.

[The Knights Have a Thousand Eyes](http://stakeaclaim.livejournal.com/7354.html) - Takes place from the point of view of the knights as they watch Arthur and Merlin fall in love. So cute.

[Stars Above, Stones Below](http://archiveofourown.org/works/476254?view_adult=true) - After some mishaps in love, Arthur swears off finding a wife until he's ready to wed. Merlin offers to be a bedmate. Drama and romance ensuuuues.

[The Crown of the Summer Court](http://www.intimations.org/fanfic/merlin/The%20Crown%20of%20the%20Summer%20Court.html) - This is before we find out who Merlin's father is in the show. Merlin finds out in this story that his father is actually king of the elves and thus makes him a contender for the throne now that the king is dead. Very good powerful Merlin story. 

[We're in a Storm in Somebody Else's Teacup](http://paperclipbitch.livejournal.com/112270.html) - Merlin and Morgana meet in a people with powers group. Things happen from there. Also a good one. Modern AU.

[Pairing Pendragon/Merlin](http://merlinkinkmeme.livejournal.com/12537.html) - Modern AU. Kind of a fanfic from the point of view of the fans. Merlin and Arthur are huuuuge fans of Camelot the show and meet up online and agree to go to a convention together. Cuteness. 

[Keep Calm and Carry On](http://tongueincheeky.livejournal.com/6104.html) - Business Boss Arthur and Subordinate Merlin, wacky times in the office that lead to adorableness. Modern AU of course.

[A Warlock's Worth](http://archiveofourown.org/works/110660?view_adult=true) - A visiting prince sets his eyes on Merlin, Arthur is not pleased at all. 

[A New Low](http://rosemaryandrue.livejournal.com/72686.html) - Merlin has diabetes, Arthur works in the same building as him. Merlin makes a big mistake one day and Arthur saves him, leads to Arthur suddenly being very much in his life much to Merlin's annoyance (and eventual happiness).

[A Study in Natural Philosophy](http://archiveofourown.org/works/61303) - Merlin crossover with Golden Compass. Light hearted and short.

[The Future Soon](http://lady-ragnell.livejournal.com/13812.html) - Modern AU. Morgana likes to throw parties and also likes to hold scryings at said parties. Arthur and Merlin hate each other. They look into the mirror of scrying and guess what they see. :P 

[The Sex Shop Around the Corner](http://archiveofourown.org/works/192339?view_adult=true) - Merlin works in a sex shop. Modern AU. Arthur is just coming to terms with his gayness. Cute hilarity happens.

[No Business Like Show Business](http://lady-ragnell.livejournal.com/2949.html) - Modern AU. Merlin the just a worker gets promoted to voice actor much to Arthur the professional actor's annoyance. Love this one too (yeah I love them all, shush you).

[Three Tasks](http://syllic.livejournal.com/2021.html) - the most crack plot but hilarious payoff and unexpectedly sweet too. Apparently there's a rule in Camelot to help prevent chaos within the upper ranks if a love triangle should happen. Merlin gets involved in one of these. Arthur wears lilac robes. This is so funny. Just read it. 

[Before the Sun Rises](http://archiveofourown.org/works/339255?view_adult=true) - Older Arthur and young-ish Merlin story. Sweet, soft.

[Resurgam](http://archiveofourown.org/collections/merlinhorror2012/works/549461?view_adult=true) - Merlin can see dead people. Modern AU. Arthur and friends at a party when some ghostly stuff happens.

[Being With You](http://archiveofourown.org/works/362487?view_adult=true) - Merlin is gay but Arthur is not, however, there is an attraction. Modern AU. Minor angst. 

[Occupy Camelot](http://archiveofourown.org/works/937236?view_adult=true) - Hahaha, I forgot about this one. It's like Occupy Wall Street but Camelot. Merlin and magic users protest Camelot's ban of magic. It's funny.

[Camelot](http://archiveofourown.org/works/138609?view_adult=true) - Merlin works at a bird sanctuary. Modern AU. They're hired to work at a renaissance fair and Merlin meets Arthur there. 

Okay. That's all. However, one of my links is no longer there which makes me incredibly sad because The Incident with the Thingy or Arthur's Adventures in Spying was an incredibly funny one. Arthur was a spy and Merlin was his tech guy. If you can find it elsewhere, great! If not, ah well.

Right now he is making the mistake of trying to do too much. But his work rate is incredible and his physicality was none existent at the start of the year but is now winning more tackles than our CDM. The last few games he has been better at stay out wide.
Many people think Townsend should be starting over him, while I think they are close, I don't agree. Townsend creates a huge threat down that right hand side. He has been running circles around the LB in the last few outings. The problem is, all he has been doing is making runs. He is having the Lennon effect almost, the final ball is missing.

null,false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; What the fuck is this? You have more data, so you expect your uncertainty to go down.

Not more data; the same data expressed in different units -- which was my point.

The figure 246 per 100,000 is the same as 2,460 per 1,000,000.  I just changed units to make the point.  246 isn't the real number either, since we have a population of 70 million ish, and some actual number of suicides.  Square rooting 70 million might be reasonable, but square rooting the number of suicides makes it seem like the number of suicides affects how accurately you can count the number of suicides.

&gt; In this case, your relative uncertainty in the first case (1/sqrt(246)) 

How can you possibly be using the number of matching cases as the estimate for your accuracy?  The _population_ size is what matters, not the count of matches.  Are you confusing `n` (successes) and `N` (trials)?

&gt; Any any given moment, each person either commits suicide or doesn't. Over a period of time, you can work out the expected numbers of suicides for any given suicide rate: you have a cumulative distribution function. Since this is just a counting experiment, you'd expect to get a Poisson distribution, for which the expected uncertainty is sqrt(N).

That is a far more reasonable statement.

&gt; We have 541 events that we have put into two bins.

True enough.  But we're comparing the two bins, which cover a specific bit of time.  We need that quantity of time again to make something we can compare.  The whole bin is now our unit of ""sample"".

Let's go back to poisson basics... if we were rolling a die, then the expectation that the next throw will be a six is always 1/6, regardless of when the last six was thrown.  However, in 100 throws I might not get exactly 1/6 of them being 6 -- it might be high, say 20.  In the next 100 throws it might be low, say 12.  

With a dice we know the process results in 1/6 expectation, but pretend we didn't know it was a dice.  Given just those two results we can't estimate the 1/6; we can't say that the low one is ""low"" or that the high one is ""high"".  We would need far, far more than these two runs of 100 each.  That is essentially my point.

&gt; Obviously it's possible to hide a real pattern with your binning, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to calculate what your binned data implies.

If all you have is two figures, then yes, it's impossible.  You can't possibly know whether A is the ""mean"" and B is high, or that ""B"" is the mean, and A is low.",null,0,null,1424727495,null,0,false,0,couv0bd,null,t3_2wv4zb,null,t1_couv0bd,null,t1_couu2ap,null,null,null,1424761194,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

I first go to tripadvisor's site, select the destination I'm interested in and then look at the hotels ordered by rank.

These places are usually clean and well-run but may not have a pool or a restaurant- not a big deal if staying in a city like Barcelona where there are more restaurants, cafés and tapas bars than you can shake a stick at.

Check availability and rates via the various price comparison sites, but also see if the hotel has its own site where you can book directly. There will often be special offers if you book directly that aren't available from the price comparison sites. 

I've always found that the best way to get a good, clean, friendly hotel at a reasonable rate.

Another option I've used if staying for a week or so is to rent a flat through either housetrip.com or homeaway.co.uk Usually works out cheaper than a hotel, plus there's a fully-equipped kitchen, so you can save a lot on food by self-catering.

Personally though, I just think the accents are, like the rest of the regeneration process, a tad unpredictable. Sometimes influenced by the Doctor's subconscious, sometimes completely outside his control. 

Perhaps it's a little like how the woman with the Sisterhood of Karn put it in Night of the Doctor.. ""What do you NEED right now?"" 

The First Doctor died of old age, after his grumpy and unpredictable personality had been mellowed over years of travelling. He needed to be younger, kinder, less intimidating. 

Becomes the Second Doctor, the little man who was constantly underestimated by his enemies, but who went down begging for mercy, made to feel small and unimportant by the Time Lords. He needed to become a more imposing, more hands-on Doctor who would command attention and respect. 

Becomes the Third Doctor. Lives a life largely overshadowed by his confinement to Earth, stuck with humans and paperwork and the Master. Dies facing his fears, needs to become an unconstrained wanderer, a man without ties, a Bohemian hero. 

Becomes the Fourth Doctor. Lives a long mad life, eventually falling to his death as the universe falls apart, obsessed with notions of entropy and decay, becoming tetchy and serious. Needed a fresh injection of energy, a new youthful lease on life. 

Becomes the Fifth Doctor, faces the universe with a smile and an encouraging word and is generally treated very poorly. In his final adventure he is poisoned, imprisoned, tortured, burned, shot at, suffocated, falls down a hill, crashes a spaceship, and nearly gets boiled in mud, just because he was being a happy go lucky chap and wanted to find out where some tracks in the mud lead to. Needs to become the kind of person who doesn't bother with triviality, and doesn't get pushed around. 

Becomes the Sixth Doctor... And here as I say is where some more back story to his regeneration would help! But, sometime after being manipulated and deceived by the Time Lords, the Master and the Valeyard, with all his pomp and bluster not being enough to stop an irate ginger kid screeching at him about carrot juice, he needed to become the less obviously serious, more subtly calculating and manipulative Seventh Doctor. The accent was probably not a prime concern, although it was certainly very suited to the character Seven became with its ponderous rolled Rs, the portentious tone quick to both sharpness and light. 

The Seventh Doctor spent a life filled with clever plans and long convoluted schemes, and got shot by some kids because he didn't look where he was going landing in a famously gun-toting country. Must have felt like a proper Charlie, which would perhaps explain why he needed to become somebody who faced the universe more honestly, more emotionally, and more head-on than he did. 

I seem to have banged on for a while and gone off on a proper tangent, sorry about that. My point is, sometimes part of what the Doctor needs when he regenerates is a particular attitude, or quality, or feeling, and sometimes the accent is part of that, other times it isn't.

I disagree with your comparison though, where if you're shooting all around London, and greater London you need to secure locations, dress sets, build sets, depending on the script you may need rain trucks, or wait for specific weather, etc. etc.

Most films I've been on shoot 2-5 pages a day. The more complex the shots, amount of extras, all that stuff can leave you with less than a few minutes shot per day. Also in England they normally shoot 10 hour days (pretty sure it's 10, but no more than 12 on a good union gig).

null,false,DrSecretan,null,null,null,"This is just my opinion, but the only current accounts worth considering right now are the Halifax Reward account, Santander 123, TSB Plus, Club Lloyds, Bank of Scotland Vantage, and Nationwide FlexDirect. There may be other accounts to consider if you're a high net worth individual, if you're a student who is eligible for an interest free overdraft, or if some bank is giving you a special mortgage or loan deal which requires you have their current account; but the accounts I've listed are probably the best for most people.

These accounts all give some level of monthly reward, and the best one for you will depend on your circumstances. If you tend to keep a low balance then Halifax's £5 per month reward plus £125 opening bonus will likely be the best value for you. If you keep a high balance then the Santander 123 account will likely be better for you, with the cash back on bills being an added bonus. Nationwide, Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB are somewhere in the middle, and you can do your own calculations to figure out exactly which one of those might suit you best.

My understanding is that the RBS and Natwest Cashback Plus scheme isn't all that great. They run the occasional decent promotion, but that's usually time limited. Santander, Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland run similar schemes (Santander call theirs ""Retailer Offers"", Lloyds Group call it ""Everyday Offers""), so Cashback Plus is unlikely to trump the already appealing offers from the other players.

What is it that you're expecting in benefits?

null,false,palordrolap,mccoy,McCoy,null,"Six did spend an awful lot of time hanging around on Gallifrey and he didn't have a lot of time to prepare his regeneration. It happened sooner than even he expected. He knows to plan ahead, and in his future, he gets better at it... even if the odd kiss influences things every now and again.

The other part of the Time Lord-affected regeneration theory is that the Doctor, when he has chance to plan ahead and isn't interfered with, puts future choices in place beforehand. He almost always chooses younger. Remember how Romana chose her new appearance on the fly? The Doctor almost never has that luxury. He plans ahead.

One to Two - he had no choice but was too old to be made older. He ends up as an older gent again. Time Lords 1, Doctor 0.

Two to Three - More input from the Doctor this time. He chooses aspects of a dashing dandy, putting as much into place before the Time Lords can interfere. Time Lords 1, Doctor 1.

Three to Four - The Doctor has planned ahead again. He decides to keep the curly hair but is fed up of being deadly serious all the time. Time Lords 1, Doctor 2.

Four to Five was clearly planned well in advance, and possibly partially retroactively after the fact. The whole Watcher arc was the zany doctor's last gasp at a crazy way to go. No doubt Five ties up the loose ends once he has his faculties about him. Very young this time. Time Lords 1, Doctor 3.

Five to Six is interesting because he reveals he's unsure it's even possible this time. His subconscious steps in and chooses a strong character he had locked horns with previously. Score draw this time. No Time Lord interference either. Time Lords 1, Doctor 3, Chance 1.

Six to seven I've covered above. Time Lords 2, Doctor 3, Chance 1

Seven to Eight - The TV movie. The Doctor and the Time Lords have called truce because he is taking the essence of The Master back to Gallifrey. The Doctor has had a huge amount of time to plan ahead and is practically retired. It's guaranteed that his new incarnation will be young. Time Lords 2, Doctor 4, Chance 1.

Eight to War - We see this happen and he says he needs to be something different to fight the Time War. He actually chooses to be a young man again, as we see in his reflection. We only really catch up with this incarnation at the end of his tenure. Time Lords 2, Doctor 5, Chance 1.

War to Nine. *Quelle surprise*, he's young again, and possibly thanks to an interfering kiss from Clara, he has a northern accent. Not quite a matching accent, but he's chosen youth - possibly on the fly and left everything else to chance. We'll call this a win for chance. Time Lords 2, Doctor 5, Chance 2.

Nine to Ten - Affected by Rose, he's a Londoner by voice, and more youthful by choice... but he left some things up to chance on purpose. He wants ginger but doesn't get it. Time Lords 2, Doctor 5.5, Chance 2.5.

Ten to Ten 1/2 and Doctor Donna - The non-fighting hand makes the Donna Doctor and the Doctor Donna. This is another bit of quick thinking on behalf of the Doctor. He makes an on-the-fly decision to stay as he is, but more than a bit of Donna is thrown into the mix. Time Lords 2, Doctor 6, Chance 3.

Ten to Eleven - Ten probably planned to live a long and happy life with Rose, and we've witnessed the Master pull the same 'choose youth' trick on the fly, adding weight to this whole theory. He's bound to want to start over... and this kind of backfires when the Gallifreyan incarnation dies young, and ends up even younger still. He may even have been kissed by someone, affecting his behaviour. Calling this one more of a chance win, even if he had a bit of input. He definitely left the hair colour to chance again. Time Lords 2, Doctor 6, Chance 4.

Eleven to Twelve - Clara's already interfered earlier in the Doctor's timeline, but she cries out through a crack in the universe, ""If you love him, you'll bring him back."". I'm working on the assumption that the crack leads to the Time Lords. Who else would be able to or even *want* to resurrect him? Of course, they haven't forgotten their tricks. He's got to be older. But he also kind of wants to be older. He picked this new face for a reason. Also the accent may or may not have something to do with Amy Pond. Calling this a win for the Time Lords. Time Lords 3, Doctor 6, Chance 4.

Also this idea that people didn't seem to react makes absolutely no sense. What impact does that have? Yes we saw the replays and it shows what a dangerous ""tackle"" it was. I still can't figure out what he's even trying to say. This is a completely nonsensical statement that has no relation to anything that happened.

The fact that Atkinson is finding it hard to make these calls just shows that he's not fit to ref a game then. His job is to be able to make these calls. If he can't do that then he doesn't deserve his position.

I do - I grew up around it and saw it with my own eyes.

&gt; I have lived on JSA and I know families that do. There's no way you can but significant money aside while on £71 a week or whatever. 

That's because they aren't on JSA, but will be on all sorts of sickness benefits due to a ""bad back"" or ""anxiety"" or some sort of condition that's *just about* going to plausibly stop them from working but makes it very difficult to prove otherwise.

Don't forget that it's not *just* JSA or Income Support or Incapacity Benefit (as it was back then), but the money saved from not having to pay rent (hello Housing Benefit), Council Tax (hello Council Tax Benefit) or prescription or dental charges.

&gt; If people are squirreling away money they've almost certainly been doing cash in hand work or have been getting undeclared income of some kind 

A lot of them were doing that too yes - it was pretty fucking galling to see people going out working cash in hand (and yes I do know that for a fact, because they were all very willing to freely admit it) and claiming benefits whilst your own family was trying to do the right thing and get by as best they could.

Granted families like that are a minority, but they are no less wrong for being in a minority and only serve to make the system - and life - all that much harder for those that ARE genuine or those that DO need a little bit of help to get by.

MP's salaries were introduced to allow middle class people to have a realistic shot at being an MP, as before MPs were paid the barriers of entry were very, very high. An MP's salary should reward him or her adequately for the hard work they provide for their constituent, and they should not be out of pocket for the work they do, thus expenses, but it should NOT be a way to enrich oneself. The base salary that all 600 MPs get is over double the median salary in the UK, chairmanship and/or membership of committee attracts a bonus, as do ministerial posts. 

There's also a very large severance package and an index-linked pension. So if you were to be an MP and want to return to your old job as a result of leaving your seat you'd probably be financially okay for a little while.

I am content with my MP having the large salary, the index linked pension, and the resettlement grant, but I do disagree with raising the salary of MPs to 'attract a better standard of candidate'.

This doesn't even make sense - you're arguing that people who aren't vegetarian aren't vegetarian because they're not happy being vegetarian? How do people know if they would be happy not eating meat if they never actually try it?

&gt; For an individual meal, no. For meals covering a week, it's less of an argument, more the status quo. We're not going to get people off all meat until Quorn (or the like) is so up to scratch that it's indistinguishable.

You might as well argue that every meal 'needs' bread, or rice, or a banana, or lettuce. People who never try to not eat meat will never know whether they can be happy not eating meat. If you don't try, how could you possibly know?

I'm not saying that everyone can just stop eating meat overnight - but it's certainly doable and anecdotally, I eat far, far better, tastier, healthier meals now than I ever did when I ate meat. Sure it's a privilege to be able to invest time in changing my dietary habits. It takes time to learn what to eat, what your body needs, where you get nutrients from. It takes time to change up your weekly menu, to figure out where to shop, what to buy etc - but it's not like it's impossible and it's certainly not boring. Not only does it reduce cruelty to animals (which not everybody cares about, granted), but it also means doing something to combat the insane environmental damage that the meat &amp; dairy industry are doing.

Meat replacements like Quorn have their place (Although personally, I enjoy Fry's considerably more than Quorn, and they seem less well known so give them a try if you fancy), but they're hardly something I eat every week.

Meat is a habit - habits can be broken. It's not some ingrained law of humanity that people will always eat meat.",null,0,null,1424735202,null,0,false,0,couzkpv,null,t3_2wrvse,null,t1_couzkpv,null,t1_coupaas,null,null,null,1424763335,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

While you're not wrong, what you describe isn't entirely accurate.  Tax avoidance **is** legal.  However, submitting an incorrect return is a civil offence.  *(Sch. 24 FA2007.)*  If you use an avoidance scheme and it does not in fact result in the reduced liability to tax that you claim, you committed a Sch. 24 offence.  Often the facts in these cases are not crystallised until a judge has examined the scheme and rendered a decision and indeed often not until it has been through all the appeal stages.  The use of the avoidance scheme is legal, but submitting an incorrect tax return is not.

&gt; So it is simply nonsense, to equate people breaking the rules, and filing fraudulent claims, with people using the rules set by the government to minimise their tax burden.

Ok, this is an honest question, do you really believe this?

The sort of avoidance schemes HMRC investigate aren't simply, ""People using the rules set by government to minimise their tax burden.""  To be fair, the language used is really unhelpful.  HMRC use a definition of avoidance which essentially boils down to using the rules in a way which was not their intended use.  The problem is that there's no clean divider between intentional tax planning *(an investment in an ISA, say)* and the softer end of what HMRC calls avoidance.

Let's take a really quick look at a couple of schemes.  *(Well reported ones, so you can go look them up if you want and check I'm not just feeding you lies.)*

The Working Wheels scheme used by Chris Moyles:  The 'taxpayer' claims to be trading as a used car salesman.  He never buys or sells a single vehicle.  Not one.  He signs a load of complicated paperwork which generate an on paper expense for finance expenses.  He admits that the driver for the contracts was purely to generate a loss for tax purposes.  

Tower MCashback:  A asset is purchased *(a genuine asset)* under a contract which was 75% funded by loan finance.  The loan financing is returned to the bank, by the seller and the buyer claims the whole cost of the asset in calculating their capital allowances.  In case that's a bit unclear:  You want to buy a van for work, from me which costs £30,000.  You borrow £90,000 from the bank.  You give me £120,000 and I pay the bank back the £90,000 you borrowed.  You then claim you spent £120,000 on the van.

I think it's fair to say that these schemes are far from investing in an ISA, or a company director choosing to take dividends, rather than taking a salary, which incurs a higher rate of tax.

&gt; Moreover, it is not true that the 100x more is being stolen by people whose wealth is huge - in fact a very substantial part of this tax gap is by people of limited means, small businesses, cash-in-hand traders and so on. 

Genuinely, thank you for using legitimate figures.

However, even if we just go with the avoidance figure in that pile, which will be based on schemes which fall within the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes regime we're looking at nearly thirty times the loss to avoidance as to benefit fraud.

However, there's something that's worth knowing about HMRC's Tax Gap *(over and above the fact that it's really just fancy guesswork)*.  HMRC doesn't include avoidance schemes in the Tax Gap which are believed to work.  Now, per the definition HMRC uses for avoidance this is still avoided tax.  A couple of years ago the PAC stated that HMRC should start measuring this loss, but they still don't.  Arguably it's not a part of the Tax Gap, but I do think it's legitimate to estimate it.  *(Since the entire point is that it's tax lost to schemes which don't operate as the law is intended to work, it would give legislators something to look at in terms of whether they should fix those broken pieces of legislation.)*

If serving your country means you should be able to afford the best in life, why are soldiers, nurses, and teachers currently paid so little? How many first-rate nurses and teachers end up in private schools/hospitals as they do not feel well rewarded?

I'm kind of strawmanning you here but I see no world where I would be happy that my MP is earning a salary that is WORLDS away from the average salary in their constituencies. MPs need to be more in touch with the average voter, not less. I'm content for the current salary to continue, and I'm content for it to be linked to inflation. I'm also content for MPs to keep their pensions - it's hardly an unfair reward for a career spent in public service. But the only way I can see a much larger salary being a reality would be if there were some kind of limitation on outside earnings - say 10% of total salary. 

FYI, being an MP is not a London job. It's a job based in a constituency with frequent travel to London, for which they are reimbursed, and provided with money towards accommodation. For MPs further away from London this may mean they spend a large amount of time in London, but when I was working in &lt;a civil service office&gt; a few years ago, one of the ministerial team was a Scottish MP and he went back to his constituency on Fridays, and was back in the office on Tuesdays. So of his working week only 60% of it was spent in London.

In all seriousness though, as an American, the fans of our professional sports teams are shit compared to European football fans.

spurs supporters make a point of referring to themselves as yids, chanting we are the yid army and have it plastered across banners and shirts and whatever. even their reddit has ""a legion of 10,742 faithful yids"" as a user count. nothing to do with judaism, the vast majority of spuds have nothing to do with religion and still call themselves yids. it's up on wiki as official club nickname.

take the case of emmanuel frimpong who got in hot water with the FA after using the word on twitter for assuming it was just the spud equivalent of ""gooner"", which it is, to them at least.

it's a word that i'd have thought would be best left to history's trash heap (you think there aren't jewish west ham supporters who wouldn't rather never hear that word again?), but as long as spuds are stoking the fires, shouting it from the terraces (not that you'll hear a lot of shouting at the lane even on a good day) and using it exclusively to refer to themselves, it's a word that will keep coming back to them.

I suspect that they've extended his contract first instead of waiting to tie someone more valuable down to a longer deal because Wootton will have been so eager to get his feet under the table after going perilously close to leaving the club, that he probably accepted a minimal wage increase - if any - and Leeds can show that they're doing work and planning for future seasons.

I think that a big part of his success after being brought back into the team is that he gives us an extra player capable of winning headers in the box for us, which is a significant factor in why we've suddenly stopped conceding terrible goals from set pieces (Bamba's presence is another important influence in that as well, of course). He also hasn't been properly skinned by a tricky winger yet, which is pleasing although I can't help but think that this is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off in our defence. However, my deepest concern is that he still hasn't proven himself as a centre half at Leeds. When you play as badly as he did at the start of the season and don't play in that position since, it raises a lot of question marks which haven't been dealt with. He's still not as agile as Bellusci, as strong as Cooper, or as communicative as Bamba.

Hopefully this is still a case of him being a fairly young and needing the right kind of management to really improve, but unless we see a big improvement in him as a player, this extension has been pointless.

Here's the particular line that got me thinking:

&gt;i'd rather see a hundred more posts like this than american tv ratings, upvote parties and thanksgiving messages

Don't you think that there's a bit of truth to that? Why did the Chelsea joke attract so much heat while shitposts (IMO) like what the guy mentions warrants enough importance to go to front page? 

Some of the Brits (there's a certain wizard around here) are defensive about what they see as ""their"" club, and fair enough, while the sheer number of Americans makes for boring and recycled content. Look at how many upvotes the Nielsen ratings for the NLD tweet got a few weeks ago. Who cares about that shit? Are we Nielsen's data collectors? Why is it upvoted that high? 

Had some British friends from Leeds a few years ago, and I totally get why the English would be protective of their club. I mean, they weren't old enough to remember the days when Leeds played in the Premier League, have seen their club explode and almost dissolve too many times to count, and are now stuck in the Championship. I don't think I've met a pair of people who hate United as much as they do, though. Can us Americans even come close to that level of hatred for Arsenal, all things considered?

null,false,Leandover,null,null,null,"""While you're not wrong, what you describe isn't entirely accurate. Tax avoidance is legal. However, submitting an incorrect return is a civil offence.""

There is no such thing as a 'civil offence'. You have criminal offences, and civil wrongs.

""HMRC use a definition of avoidance which essentially boils down to using the rules in a way which was not their intended use. The problem is that there's no clean divider between intentional tax planning (an investment in an ISA, say) and the softer end of what HMRC calls avoidance.""

Well indeed. HMRC at one time was trying to clamp down on personal services companies, which are widely used by people like BBC TV stars, claiming that it was avoidance - but to people using the scheme they would argue that it was less of a contrivance than marketed schemes such as loan schemes (where people get paid via an offshore company in the form of a 'loan' that they will never repay).

""Let's take a really quick look at a couple of schemes.""

I am aware of the schemes, and I think they all stink, the problem however is that in fact the HMRC spends quite a lot of money investigating and pursuing these schemes, and while it manages to close them down in many cases actually making any criminal charges stick has still proven to be impossible. The issue is that the lawyers making these schemes are better than the lawyers working for HMRC.

By contrast benefits cheats tend to be extremely unsophisticated - you don't need a law degree to fill in a fraudulent benefits application.

So I think it is unfair to make statements that more attention is paid to benefits cheats than tax evasion, without actually examining the resources expended, and the outcomes from doing so. In fact, the government, pretty much every year, comes up with new anti-avoidance laws:

* 2014 - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/10709526/Budget-2014-Savers-and-pensioners-to-benefit-from-tax-overhaul.html http://www.itcontracting.com/contractor-tax-avoidance/
* 2015 - http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/feb/23/jack-straw-and-malcolm-rifkind-respond-to-cash-for-access-allegations-politics-live-blog

So it simply is not true that the government pays no, or less, attention to this, than benefits fraud.

It also doesn't make too much sense to use the government's very narrow figures for benefit fraud, but then use a third party estimate - much higher- for tax fraud. Clearly the figures are not comparable. 

It's not simply a case of people being angry about people submitting fraudulent applications for benefits - there is an overall spend of £251 billion on 'welfare', and much that is not strictly 'fraudulent' is still criticised as waste.

I had a quick search of the Daily Mail for some of their stories, here are some of the top few, to see whether in fact people are upset about strictly 'benefits fraud':

* http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2963750/Benefits-single-mother-admits-spending-3-000-taxpayers-cash-dream-round-world-trip-Australia-Bali-Dubai.html - Single mother spends benefits on luxury holiday - living expenses funded by parents, refuses to take money from father of her child
* http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2913336/Supersize-benefits-family-claims-50-000-handouts-year-spend-cash-designer-trainers-mopeds.html - Family gets £50k/year in benefits to sit on their arses
*http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2877774/The-single-mother-eight-children-planning-lavish-Christmas-funded-benefits-worth-2-200-MONTH.html - family spends benefits on loads of plastic crap for Christmas

As you can see, none of this is in fact 'benefits fraud', but they reflect a sense that many billions of benefits payments go to people who do not deserve them. Of course there is a fine line between 'he's a lazy fuck who needs to get off his arse' and 'town has no employment opportunities and thousands suffering depression', but there is a strong feeling that the benefits system makes people lazy - in low-paid work, many employers will tell you that British workers are lazy and just want to collect their tax credits, and you are better off with a Polish immigrant, and this effect is what people are concerned about more than a handful of benefits applications for non-existent kids, or grannies who died 10 years ago.",null,0,null,1424739800,null,0,false,0,cov230i,null,t3_2wusky,null,t1_cov230i,null,t1_couznv0,null,null,null,1424764505,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Being an English fan is alot different to being a US fan. You go into work/school on Monday and get ripped by your colleagues when you lose. You go into the pub and use football as the start to almost any conversation. I'm a South Londoner and am guaranteed to get some form of abuse if I leave the house in a Spurs shirt. Jeff Stelling, Match of the Day, John Motson, Bovril, the tabloids... There is a whole cultural dimension to English football that a foreign fan can just never quite 'get' and it creates a natural divide. 

English spurs fans show bias towards Mason, Bentaleb and Kane because we need English players to be playing in our top domestic league. We always dreamed of making it to spurs academies as kids and love seeing the lads fulfil their dreams. It's exactly the same for US fans with Yedlin and I think both sides should appreciate this factor more. 

Growing up, I've seen the Tottenham of the 90s and early 00s and the dreaded mid table obscurity. Every English yid will, and should remind you all of the utter wank they had to support year after year, and if we do ever see dark days like that again, I hope you all do watch every game, because it's made the last few years of (relative) success so, so sweet. 

We hate what money has done to English Football, and international fans represent some of that (but it's not your fault that you've been marketed a warped shiny version of English Football). All English fans dream of the days of terraces and when winning matches was only for glory and not for champions league revenues.

The way we played against Southampton was actually quite impressive, we should have started with Moreno and Sturridge, but he took the alteration later in the game when he understood that it was needed to change something. When they where playing really well. 

So i think the alterations will come earlier in the future. Something we still have to remember is that our squad is pretty dam young and will be even younger next season, with Glen Johnson and Gerrard leaving. So will take some time before we reach our peak top and the potential the players have. 

Another thing is that it is hard to almost impossible to go from a team who struggles defensively and offensively to turn both of those around in a week or two. He wanted to stay with what he believed was correct, but we did not have the players to play in a 4-3-3.

We've been talking a bit in this thread about stigma, so I think this is a potentially useful place to talk about the language around suicide. One of the things I really liked about this article was the absence of the phrase ""committing suicide"", which lots of suicide prevention groups recommend against using. That language comes from a time when attempting suicide or having suicidal feelings was seen as sinful:

* [perpetrate or carry out (a mistake, crime, or immoral act).](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define:+commit)

* [To do; to perpetrate, as a crime, sin, or fault.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/commit)  
Bible, Exodus xx. 4:  
""Thou shalt not commit adultery.""

* http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commit

It's obvious how this kind of language is rooted in and perpetuates harmful stigma. There is no personal weakness or failure in thinking about suicide, and being ashamed makes it harder to ask for help. Instead the article uses the term ""self-inflicted deaths"". Another alternative is ""dying from suicide"".

When I replied to her that the government she voted for has been cutting legal aid and that the solution is easy - we can have a better justice system if we all just pay more tax - she replied that ""I'd be happy to pay more tax, if I had more money"". I was flabbergasted.

This woman is in the richest 5% or 10% of the UK population, better off, at least, than 9 out of 10 people. She owns a nice bungalow in a nice town, she drives a decent little car which she bought new and the last 20 years she has gone on foreign holidays at least once a year. She has a modest investment income, enough that she can afford to eat out and pay decorators to keep her house spotless. She really has no idea how lucky she is.

I'd say this is the reason we have picked up so many late points this season. The players know they have a job to do, we go out there to win every game regardless of whether we're playing Chelsea or Leicester. We scored an equaliser in the 96th minute and Rose was running to pick the ball up from the back of the net. We've gone behind to Chelsea and Arsenal and won, because regardless of the score, the team knows they have a job to do.

From a personal point of view, I think it's mainly that lots of (not all mind you) US fans seem to try to make British football like a US sport instead of learning about or assimilating themselves into the culture.

/r/soccer in particular Americanises the sport to such a degree that it's strange and embarrassing most of the time. With a large influx of US Redditors (there are more US redditors here anyway), it's started to twist /r/coys into something similar.

I know football is, relatively speaking, something new and different in the US. And there's also not a great deal to get excited about in terms of Major League Soccer. But there's not reason to treat the Premier League like that.

Also, stop turning everything into an acronym. Saying things like ""EPL"" makes you look like a right twunt.

&gt; For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability) placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change. Two neighbours who almost certainly saw the murderer immediately after the shooting had seen him go off in this direction, and later failed to identify George at an identification parade.

The Origin of the Word “Soccer”
DAVEN HISKEY 260
Today I found out the origin of the word “soccer”.  For all you out there who love to complain when Americans, and certain others, call “Football”, “Soccer”, you should know that it was the British that invented the word and it was also one of the first names of what we now primarily know of as “Football”.
In fact, in the early days of the sport among the upper echelons of British society, the proper term for the sport was “Soccer”.  Not only that, but the sport being referred to as “Soccer” preceded the first recorded instance of it being called by the singular word “Football” by about 18 years,  with the latter happening when it became more popular with the middle and lower class. When that happened, the term “Football” gradually began dominating over “Soccer” and the then official name “Association Football”.

In the 1860s, as in most of history- with records as far back as 1004 B.C.- there were quite a lot of “football” sports in existence being played popularly throughout the world and of course, England.   Many of these sports had similar rules and eventually, on October 26th, 1863, a group of teams in England decided to get together and create a standard set of rules which would be used at all their matches.  They formed the rules for “Association Football”, with the “Association” distinguishing it from the many other types of football sports in existence in England, such as “Rugby Football”.

Now British school boys of the day liked to nickname everything, which is still somewhat common.  They also liked to add the ending “er” to these nicknames.  Thus Rugby was, at that time, popularly called “Rugger”.  Association Football was then much better known as “Assoccer”, which quickly just became “Soccer” and sometimes “Soccer Football”.

The inventor of the nickname is said to be Charles Wredford Brown, who was an Oxford student around the time of Association Football’s inception.  Legend has it, in 1863 shortly after the creation of Association Football, Wredford-Brown had some friends who asked him if he’d come play a game of “Rugger”, to which he replied he preferred “Soccer”.  Whether that story’s true or not, the name caught on from around that point on.

In the beginning, the newly standardized Rugby and Soccer were football sports for “gentlemen”, primarily being played by the upper echelons of society.  However, these two forms of football gradually spread to the masses, particularly Soccer as Rugby didn’t really catch on too well with the lower classes.  This resulted in the name switching from “Soccer” and “Association Football”, to just “Football”; with the first documented case of the sport being called by the singular term “Football” coming in 1881, 18 years after it was first called “Soccer” or, officially, “Association Football”.

The game gradually spread throughout the world under the lower class name of “Football”, rather than “Soccer” as the “gentlemen” called it.  The problem was, though, that a lot of other countries of the world already had popular sports of their own they called “Football”, such as the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, to name a few.  In these countries, the name “Soccer” was and, in some,  still is preferred for this reason.",null,0,null,1424752013,null,0,false,0,cov8v6k,null,t3_2wx6ps,null,t1_cov8v6k,null,t1_cov7dce,null,null,null,1424767778,null,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0,null

I grew up watching the Cubs, so if someone calls me plastic I'll sock them right in the mug. I mean, I already understood what it felt like to hate a red-colored rival with spoiled and obnoxious fans ;-)

While I never followed Spurs during the Sugar-era, I understand what it means to follow a team through thick and thin. I understand that sport fandom is about taking the good with the bad, as it makes victory all the more glorious. Growing up I've known folks that have turned on local teams to support the Packers, Yankees, whatever team LeBron is on, etc. Despite lack of success with my own favorite team it seemed gross to jump ship as soon as things turned South.

Leading me to Spurs. I was already an adult when I started watching footy seriously. Without any access to live games and coverage of the top leagues outside of the best teams, it was much easier for me to find the right club without skew. My impressions on each club derived from personal research (Bill Simmon's article back in the day played a role) of each club's history and fanbase, something I had never done with a sports club (I always supported Chicago, except the Sox). At the time I started watching, Spurs were playing 'Arry-ball and the squad was insanely talented. Watching Gareth Bale outrun his defender down the left flank was a thing of marvel, how could I not support this club? I have always had a penchant for the melodramatic and there is no shortage of that at Spurs, good and bad. My family is historically Jewish, so it made sense to join the Yid Army. I appreciated that the club built their squad from prospects instead of buying hot commodities, and when we did come across an established superstar it was from shrewd business (VDV, Ade). I was in awe of how spectacular the atmosphere sounded a couple years ago, especially during the Champion's League run. I wanted to be a part of that, not for the victory but to get behind a brilliant team built the right way that fought against the plastic clubs (Chelsea, Man City), the sketchy cunts and bastards of football (Arsenal), and literal fascist assholes of Europe (Lazio)...and doing it with style. No boring tiki-taka, no obnoxious parking the bus, no 'walking it in' for a boring three points.

This subreddit has no claim laid to it by any nationality or locality, and I would expect that there are Spurs supporters throughout Europe and Asia as well (and that that number will continue to grow if we continue to develop in the way that I have seen us developing in the 7ish years that I've been obsessively following the club).  Basically, here's how I feel:

- Nationality shouldn't matter at all

- Comments made should matter-- committing faux pas / being incredibly circlejerky / posting garbage content that starts to feel bandwagon-y is going to get responded to with some negativity, but that's going to be the case in any subreddit in which you press the buttons of the established community.

- The community itself here has become pretty toxic lately in my opinion.  There is a vocal minority of both  sides of this issue that are just jabbing at each other and making it difficult for folks who sit in the middle (like myself) to feel comfortable speaking, much less voicing our opinions on anything for fear that it will be connected to our nationality in some way.

- There seems to be much less debate and discussion over the upcoming fixtures, developing players/loan watch, transfer targets, team news, and more and more content that is designed to contribute to nothing but the user's Karma.  That kind of thing is great right after a game, when we're all excited, and mostly drunk, but it does start to get old over a protracted period of time.  I think this also seems to get tied to American fans (perhaps unfairly, but I can't say honestly), which drives down the subreddit's opinion of them at times. 

- It's not a contest of who's a better supporter.  It's really as simple as that.  Many English fans seem to resent Americans who have never ""experienced it"" and ""can't understand"", but many Americans would give just about anything to be able to come and see a game, so that we could really ""get it"".

&gt;

&gt;__Paulo Renato Rebocho Ferreira__ (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpawlu fɨˈʁɐjɾɐ], born 18 January 1979) is a retired [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal) [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who played as a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)). He was known for his versatility and ability to play on both the right and left side of defence.

&gt;Ferreira was signed by [José Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho) for [FC Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto) from [Vitória de Setúbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vit%C3%B3ria_de_Set%C3%BAbal) in 2002.

Kompany - Requires a covering CB, allows him to break up play higher up the pitch without getting caught out, i.e. what Lescott was.

Completely agree that there is a large portion of key players who have barely played a game together this season, examples are Aguero, Silva, Nasri, Milner, Yaya, Zaba, Clichy and Kompany, Hart has been solid and I have seen a lot 'better' keepers have worst performances than any of his this season.

Yaya is my favourite and probably just edges Silva imo, will always remember his 'big' goals he's got over the past couple seasons.

Louis has been far from impressive, he's a decent manager and has a good chance at least bringing United back in to the top four, but I think poor performances against us and Liverpool could put his future in serious jeopardy.

&gt; What your landlord must do

&gt;Your landlord is always responsible for repairs to:

* the property’s structure and exterior
* **basins, sinks, baths and other sanitary fittings including pipes and drains**
* heating and hot water
* gas appliances, pipes, flues and ventilation
* electrical wiring
* any damage they cause by attempting repairs

&gt; Your landlord is usually responsible for repairing common areas, eg staircases in blocks of flats. Check your tenancy agreement if you’re unsure.
Your responsibilities

&gt; You should only carry out repairs if the tenancy agreement says you can.

&gt; **You can’t be forced to do repairs that are your landlord’s responsibility.**

Thats for a start :). I might look into this other thing with your Landlord moving back in because that doesn't seem right. This happened to my bro when he lived aboard and my advice to him was get out asap. Also, if this guy is foreign and possible ignorant or an ass remember that your deposit should be protected in one of those schemes by law and if its not the landlord will be fined and order to pay your legal costs etv. Don't let him deduct this from your deposit.

Second jobs is interesting - most people would find themselves overworked being an MP. It's a calling, rather than a job you do for fun. 100 hour weeks on average. But then you get some MPs who only put in the bare minimum face time, 20-30 hours, and top up their income with other jobs. They would argue that they have to, because they have to support their family and there's no way to do it on the current MP salary. Other MPs argue back that, they chose the career willingly, their families presumably agreed to support them whether thats through financial sacrifices or otherwise.

Personally my solution would be to massively simplify our tax system. Imagine if we only had Income Tax, no sin tax, no ""insurance"" that is really a tax, no corp tax. Also no tax relief. Charity tax relief is effectively a government subsidy and I don't see why Eton deserves taxpayers' money while we are closing community centres and libraries.

Having only one simple tax would mean tax avoidance is no longer a thing. You either pay what you owe or you fraudulently underdeclare and become guilty of criminal evasion. No loopholes, no offshoreing, non doms don't get a free pass.

The complexity of our tax code creates an entire industry dedicated to two things:

- cleverly avoiding tax laws for a hefty fee

- adding more tax laws

It's a cartel between HMT/HMRC staff (many of whom go on to work in the private sector), private tax advisers, lawyers and accountants and the clients who get to underpay tax. It's not remotely fixable without a Gordian Knot type solution because the only people who are capable of navigating our labyrinthine tax system are benefiting from the cartel they've created and so have no motive to fix it.

Now the beauty of making it all Income Tax is that that's a system that can suit both left and right. Left can raise personal allowances (or even introduce Basic Income through negative tax) and Right can lower top rate tax, making it very easy for governments to impose their fiscal policies.",null,0,null,1424762567,null,0,1424763119,0,covcxm7,null,t3_2wxaz8,null,t1_covcxm7,null,t3_2wxaz8,null,null,null,1424769676,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

The General Election puts people in a different frame of mind. For most people those issues simply aren't what's important in their lives, also people become conservative and risk averse, sticking to tried and trusted parties rather than gamble on radical alternatives.

In other words we might vote Ukip in for the European Parliament because 1) we don't really give a toss and 2) it would be fun seeing the soap opera of Farage filibustering them or whatever but when things really matter we need reassurance.

3) popular music in Australia features a lot of current popular American artists, such as Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj etc. as well as locals. I'm actually a classical musician, so I guess I have different tastes to the top 40 on the radio, but I don't mind a bit of Ed Sheeran. Nice voice.

4) we celebrate Australia Day (Jan 26) with a BBQ, pool, beach cricket etc. however in recent years there's been a bit of backlash to this, as it's actually the date that Brit Capt. James Cook landed on the shores of Botany Bay and colonised Australia, which led to many years of awful treatment of the indigenous population, so some people feel it's not really a day to celebrate. 
We also get a few public holidays to do with being in the commonwealth, such as Queen's birthday, but it's just a day off really.

5) Christmas is celebrated in summer here, as our seasons are opposite to yours. Whilst we still do the tree and gift giving and a big lunch, many people substitute things like salads, shrimp, trifle etc in as well as a more traditional roast. 

6) In tough times, Australians can have a great spirit of mateship, of banding together to help each other out. At other times I also enjoy the relaxed, ""get halfway through, fuck it that'll do"" attitude.

7) Beach in summer. Watching sports live at the event is big, be it footy, cricket, tennis whatever. Otherwise youth pursuits include movies, clubbing, pub, etc.

8) I think we run these ceremonies fairly similarly to the U.S. Though Australia is becoming more and more multicultural each generation so it really depends what religious background a person is from as to what their rites and rituals will be.

9) The idea that we all ride kangaroos to work and that all the animal species are out to kill us.

Well, firstly I don't believe people who are motivated by money are necessarily ""top performers"" compared to those who aren't - and given their already significant salaries compared to the population as a whole, this certainly isn't reflected in parliament currently.  But neither is it reflected in the boardrooms up and down the country, nor elsewhere, where the level of remuneration seems to bear little to no relationship to ability or performance.  There was a study which came out of the US recently which demonstrated this quite nicely with CEOs for example.

&gt;You can still get top performers from all sorts of backgrounds and with all sorts of experience so I'm not sure I follow your point. 

It would be nice if we did then, because presently we don't (it's also worth noting we probably disagree whether Oxbridge = ""the best"" and the extent to which it carries a social class component).

Using this piece of software has helped me save around £500 a month for the last 2/3 months rather then the much smaller £100/£150 I was managing. I find the act of typing in the amount I have just spent, along with a description of the expenditure, makes spending the money more 'real'.

4) There are plenty of bank holidays we celebrate here in the UK that you don't, but I cannot think of any popular holidays (like Christmas/Easter etc.). Sometimes we have Jubilees when big events happen to the Royal Family (like weddings/anniversaries).

5) Don't think so, not too much difference. 

6) The best part of British culture is obviously the willingness to accept foreign cultures into our own. I can walk into town and see 50 different nationalities and we all get on fine. You have the occasional nutcase cunt who wants to try and stir some shit up but people here hate racists more than we hate immigrants. I love how our cultures have assimilated right on my doorstep, it's fascinating. 

7) Standard young people shit (i.e. go to the cinema etc.), but that's kinda boring. I guess the somewhat unique things young people do here for fun is drink in excess. Britain has a chill drinking culture and so often when we can't think of anything to do we'll just go to the local Spoons and get a wee bit wavey.

9) Yes-that British people have bad teeth. We have normal teeth, the rest of the world (America) needs to fuck off with that. Also tea is very popular here but there are plenty of people who don't drink it and are not tea crazy.

Mutch still seems to be getting to trips with things. But overall I agree with Pardew. I remember some really lacklustre defeats when Warnock was in charge. The 3-1 home losses to West Ham and Sunderland immediately spring  to mind. The team just looked dead on their feet. There was no fire. But I can't say that about Saturday's game. The team, overall, had a great game. It was just unfortunate that the result and decisions went against us. (Though I can understand why the ref gave the penalty.)

null,false,nifara,null,null,null,"This ""best in their field"" fallacy is one I see trotted out again and again. There are a couple of good reasons why we don't want people who are either the best in their field or people who will only become an MP if it is paid the same as a high-level private sector job.

Firstly, let's address specialisation. In our system MPs shouldn't be specialists. The concept of parliamentary neutrality depends on MPs formulating their opinions on specialist subjects from the consensus and reporting of many subject experts through white papers. This allows them (in theory) to make balanced decisions based on a broad spectrum of informed opinion.

If we elect the ""top people in the field"" as MPs then they are likely to have had experience and insight enough to form their own opinions and stances in that area. That means they are going to be biased to their own current understanding. Worse, as MPs rarely have time to keep up to date in their field whilst serving as an MP, their opinions will become more and more out of date, and yet because they see themselves as subject experts they are likely to cling to their previous views.

The ideal MP, then, is someone with a broad understanding of many different fields, a strong grasp of logic and human psychology, and someone who learns extremely quickly. These people are not necessarily ""top people in any given field"".

There is also an argument about representation - if all of your MPs are drawn from those who earn large amounts of money and who are influential in their fields their perspective will be skewed. They will not be representative of the vast majority of people who don't fit into those categories, and that foes matter because people are (from a psychological perspective) bad at consistently seeing things from a balanced perspective. That means in order to achieve overall balance you need representation from across the board.

Now let's look at ethics. MPs are, at the end of the day, public servants. The idea is that they will represent the views of their constituents and their party as selflessly as possible, and remove their own personal motivations from the equation. Now this is not always going to work (in fact I'd say it rarely works) but that is the goal, and someone who feels that unless that are financially rewarded to a degree that places them firmly in the top percent of incomes they aren't interested in the job is much more likely to consider their own opinion important. If we treat MP remuneration as reward for personal expertise then we are encouraging those MPs to rely upon that personal expertise rather than upon the will of the people.

It's also worth considering motivation. If I am motivated to be an MP because it is well paid, putting aside whether that's a motivation we think is worthwhile, can I be trusted as an MP? Ultimately the government can never pay MPs enough that the vast sums of money potentially on offer from those who would corrupt or bribe politicians would be insignificant. The private sector and foreign interests will outbid a stable paycheck every time. Now I'm not saying all MPs motivated by money are going to be corrupt, but it seems reasonable that if you have two MPs, one who does is because it's a good wage and one who doesn't care about money but wants to serve their country, one is much more likely to be motivated or swayed by monetary bribes.

There's another important factor to be considered - the historical reason for paid politicians. Once upon a time politicians weren't paid. If you were an MP you didn't get money for that, your were expected to support yourself. The change to pay MPs was instituted to ensure that anyone could be an MP, that it was not just the province of the rich. We have to considered all MP renumeration in perspective of that.",null,0,null,1424766673,null,0,false,0,covdzvy,null,t3_2wygh0,null,t1_covdzvy,null,t1_covbn6p,null,null,null,1424770383,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Second Doctor - Tomb of the Cybermen

Third Doctor - A tough call, but probably Terror of the Autons

Fourth Doctor - Another really tough call. Probably The Brain of Morbius. Possibly Genesis of the Daleks or Terror of the Zygons?

Fifth Doctor - Probably The Five Doctors. Possibly Kinda.

Sixth Doctor - The Mark of the Rani

Seventh Doctor - Battlefield

Eighth Doctor - Only one choice here, the TV Movie

I dont' disagree that there may well be differences. But the Variation within the British population is probably bigger than the variation between ""British"" and ""Slavic"" even if we do take them as identifiable groups. And to then use these features to justify ones own personal prejudices is always going to be irrational. Which is fine people are welcome to be irrational, but irrationality should never be something that makes up a national policy.

&gt;

&gt;The __Solomon curve__ is a [graphical representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_representation) of collision rate of automobiles as a function of their speed compared to the average vehicle speed on the same road. The curve based on [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research) conducted by David Solomon in the late 1950s and published in 1964.  Subsequent research suggests significant biases in the Solomon study which may cast doubt on its findings.

I don't think Christmas and Easter are celebrated as religiously as Americans do maybe. I don't know enough about America to know.

Slightly selfish, but it is useful being British and speaking English. A lot of people from different countries speak it even if you're in their country. But tourists who come here also often speak English. A lot of things on the internet are written in English. A lot of books are written in English. 

I've always lived by the sea so go sailing and know people who like water sports. 


I think weddings/funerals/births are pretty similar to America. Although i don't think Britain is as religious as America so there's a lot of ceremonies that don't involve much if any religion at all and weddings can often be at hotels.

That we all eat a roast dinner on a sunday and drink tea. I don't particularly like roasts and would be happy with one a month, there's so many different things to eat, why have the same meal each week. And plenty of people drink coffee, but mainly instant.

null,false,Zombie_Si,null,null,null,"1: I was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire (Wales, UK). My father was in the Royal Air Force so we moved house every 3 years until He retired when I was about 12. We then settled in a town called Yeovil in Somerset (England, UK) I lived there for the longest time growing up so if I'm from anywhere, Yeovil is the place.

2: Either takeaway fish &amp; chips or a Sunday roast, depending on whether I can be bothered to cook or not.

3: Mostly the same sort of music that is popular in the US, with some British artists along the same kind if styles. Yeovil had a quite healthy rock music scene growing up. My personal favourite artists are probably Annihilator (Canada) Shatter Messiah (US) and Iron Maiden (UK)

4: We have a few bank holidays (Most office type jobs and schools close, paid days off, extra pay or extra paid holiday for those who have to work) scattered through the year, with extras added for thinks like Royal Weddings and Jubilees occasionally. Other than that, each country in the UK has a day dedicated to their patron saint (Think St Paddy's day, celebrated in the US). These are not public holidays in the way that people get time off from work etc, however they are celebrated by some with parades and businesses often have sales based around these days. They are as follows:
England - St George's Day - 23rd April
Ireland &amp; Northern Ireland - St Patrick's Day - 17th March
Scotland - St Andrew's Day - 30th November
Wales - St David's Day - 1st March.

5: For the holidays we both celebrate, there is not a great deal of difference.

6: Personally I think, the sarcasm and self deprecating humour. Many have tried, but nobody can do it as well as the British. 

7: Much the same as the US really. The most popular youth things in the UK seem to me to be trips to the cinema or bowling. Live sports or live music are generally popular too, depending on age/location. Oh, and a rather unhealthy amount of alcohol.

8: The UK has a rather diverse population, so any special family event customs would depend on the background of the people involved.

9: The teeth thing. We don't put much emphasis on the idea that perfectly straight, blindingly white teeth are healthy teeth. As children, some do get braces to straighten up teeth, but in my experience, most do not (I'm guessing that's a parental decision). Tooth whitening is also not as big a thing as in the US, but it is creeping over.

10: If from a non-English speaking country, learn some basic English. I can imagine how difficult it would be to navigate Wales (Where we have most signs in both English and 
Welsh). If from an English speaking country/are an English speaker, be polite, explore the country and at least once, try and find a traditional pub and spend an evening chatting to the locals!",null,0,null,1424769912,null,0,false,0,coveot4,null,t3_2wyfb8,null,t1_coveot4,null,t3_2wyfb8,null,null,null,1424770708,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

It's not that unreasonable of a comment, having the 100% dependency of a new person on you for up to 6 months would clearly have SOME kind of impact on your work life.

If people could do their jobs without interruption and have a child, then maternity leave wouldn't exist. As a society we prioritize giving people the freedom to take care of their child for the first 6 months, and that's fine.

I don't mind if a cabinet minister wants to have a baby, but to think their job won't be affected is silly.

I'm a university student, so most types of modern music are popular among my friends. Look at the UK Top 40 singles chart for an idea of what's popular here. 

Guy Fawkes Night (celebration of the failed assassination attempt by Catholics on King James I in 1605), our four national days (St George's Day - 23 April, St Andrew's Day - 30 November, St David's Day - 1 March, St Patrick's Day - 17 March), any royal holidays we have (weddings,coronations, jubilees). Scotland also has Hogmanay celebrations at New Year and Burns Night in January which celebrates the life of writer Robbie Burns. 

We obviously don't celebrate things like 4 July, Presidents' Day, etc. your Veterans Day is much less of a deal than our Rememberance/Armistice Day (11 November) when we remember our war dead, especially those who died in World War I, by wearing red poppies on our coat lapels and attending remembrance services around the country. Generally there's a minute's silence nationwide at 11am. We have a few Christmas traditions that you don't - Christmas crackers, the Queen's speech, Christmas pudding. Easter is also slightly more important of a holiday here and usually means two weeks off for school kids, and two days off for adults. Our Mother's Day is a couple of months away from yours. 

I like our understated, reserved nature and the way that people 'get on with it' in Britain even if they are quietly complaining. I also like how receptive we are to foreign cultures, our proximity to Europe and our global cultural reputation. 

Standard young people things really, depends on the person. They go to gigs, play video games, go to the cinema, to restaurant, they travel. One big difference is that most people under 23 in the UK can't afford a car, or don't have a driving licence. 

Weddings are similar to yours as you get your traditions from us. We tend to dress a lot more formally (men wear morning coat, waistcoat, cravat, top hat and a flower). Births and deaths are largely the same, except we don't often do the whole open-casket funeral thing you do.

I'm afraid it really does.

&gt; How do people know if they would be happy not eating meat if they never actually try it?

Because they already know they like sausages, bacon, pork, steaks...they don't need to go without them to know they like them - hence my comment about substitutes.

&gt;You might as well argue that every meal 'needs' bread, or rice, or a banana, or lettuce.

I didn't say 'every meal'. Nevertheless, they're all things people couldn't go without, and would put above meat, yes? Otherwise, you're listing random foods as if people don't have a preference. They do.

&gt;I'm not saying that everyone can just stop eating meat overnight - but it's certainly doable

Lots of things are doable. That doesn't mean people want to do them.

&gt;I eat far, far better, tastier, healthier meals now than I ever did when I ate meat.

Good for you. But we're talking about everyone - and lots of them prefer meat. It's really that simple.

&gt;but it's not like it's impossible and it's certainly not boring.

My In-Laws are vegetarians. Sorry, it's just not as much fun.

&gt;which not everybody cares about, granted

I think (or like to think) that most people care about animal welfare - just because you're going to kill it for food, that doesn't mean you don't care about what sort of life it has.

&gt;but it also means doing something to combat the insane environmental damage that the meat &amp; dairy industry are doing.

That's down to price again - I'm not sure telling poor people that vegetarianism is great because they can't afford meat is going to fly too well. Again, we need a Quorn-style replacement so that this becomes moot.

&gt;Meat is a habit - habits can be broken.

Smoking is a habit. Meat is an instinctive preference.

&gt;It's not some ingrained law of humanity that people will always eat meat.

The numbers say otherwise. Veggies aside, people generally don't because they can't afford it or can't get it.",null,0,null,1424770956,null,0,false,0,covew54,null,t3_2wrvse,null,t1_covew54,null,t1_couzkpv,null,null,null,1424771729,null,1,true,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I was driving alone through a village and I saw a little girl aged about 3yrs old walking alone down the road. Just as I was driving past, she walked on to [someone's driveway](http://goo.gl/maps/DWkYH), pulled her pants down, and did the biggest shit I've ever seen! 

I thought, ""WTF?!"". I quickly pulled over up the road where I could find a parking spot and then ran back to see what had become of this girl. 

She had kept on walking, and then stopped near [a playground](http://goo.gl/maps/Ax0pA).

I tried to approach her and I asked her name, but she was really scared and shy, and she wouldn't talk to me. It's not unusual for young girls to be scared of men, as my daughters were the same at that age.  I must admit that I was kind of scared to hold her hand or start walking with her in fear of being branded an abductor/paedophile. For all I know, someone was watching her, and they saw me quickly stop the car and run over to her.

I kept her in sight and raced around to ask groups of people in the local park if they were her parents. I found a woman to come talk to her and keep her in the one place.  Eventually she was surrounded by a small group of other children and onlookers.

After a few minutes a very worried woman drove up the road, looking out her car window, and it was obviously her mother.

Turned out the girl had opened the side gate of the house and just wandered off.

2) What is your favorite food/dish from your country? 
&gt; My favourite English food would have to be a Pasty

3) What type of music is popular where you are from? Who is your favorite music artist? 
&gt; I live in Birmingham now, home of metal, and I'm a big fan of Punk/Rock/Metal et al. Currently listening to a lot of Papa Roach as I'm seeing them live next month. 

4) Are there any holidays that you celebrate in your country that we do not in the United States? 
&gt; Bonfire night/Guy Fawkes night whilst not technically a Holiday (People still work on Nov. 5th) but I have fond memories of fireworks, a big bonfire and sparklers.

5) Are there holidays that are celebrated in the U.S. that are celebrated a bit differently in your country? 
&gt; Christmas is much bigger here than in the USA. Almost everyone will take time off from work over this period. We don't have any holidays (i.e. Thanksgiving) in the run up to Christmas so to us it's the main event.

6) What is the most positive thing about being a member of your culture?
&gt; Our long and varied history which has given us strong ties and relationships with many other countries.

7) What are some things young people do for fun in your country? 
&gt;I would imagine it's very similar to an American child - Sports (though normally football [soccer], cricket &amp; rugby), cinema, video games. We have a much more relaxed attitude to alcohol here and from 15-16 onwards and you go to a house party you will probably consume alcohol. Even younger children often drink under adult supervision.

8) Are there any special customs involved with weddings/funerals/births where you are from? 
&gt;The only thing I have noticed is that our weddings tend to happen earlier in the day than yours. The wedding ceremony in the UK usually starts in the mid-morning.

9) Are there any stereotypes about your country that you feel are not true? What are they?
&gt;To echo others here - it's almost certainly the teeth thing.

10) If you had any advice to give to someone who is about to go to your country for the first time, what would it be?
&gt; Specifically for Americans I would say unless your parents are from a country, you are American first and fore most. You have a tendancy to tell me you're ""Part English, Scottish Welsh etc."" when in reality only one distant relative is from the UK.

I guess I'm not surprised that my neighbours voted for her in the first place, I have very ""fond"" memories of the former head of Thanet Council, Sandy Ezekiel, being banged up for being a corrupt wanker.

What *does* surprise me is:

&gt;Ms Duncan said she believed her prejudice might stem from the fact she rarely encountered people of other ethnicities in Thanet, Kent, where she lives.

&gt;“I hardly see any here, there are so few here. There’s no reason to have any contact with them,” she said.

&gt;“I can’t even think of anywhere in Thanet where there are any. It’s not that I choose to live here because of that, my parents brought me here when I was three and I’ve lived here ever since. I really wouldn’t want to live anywhere else, I love it.”

I wonder if she's talking about a different Thanet? There are tons of different ethnicities. I used to play cricket with tons of Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis down that way. There's a very healthy Polish community, and #gasp# even one or two Afro-Caribbeans.

While Thanet generally has a lower-than-average foreign-born population she's either blind, or stupid, or both if she honestly doesn't encounter *teh immigrunts.* No reason to have any contact.

First off you go on contributions based if you've made enough contributions, and then switch to income based after 6 months. 

Income based is calculated on the income of anyone supporting you. If you're on your own, they work it out that you have no income, so that can work in your favour, but if the person supporting you (say a family member, partner, whatever) earns over a specific amount then you'll get very little.

At best, you can get your NI contributions paid for by the DWP, so at least you don't have any missing contributions, and this is something that is covered in the first six months when you're on income based benefits too.

The problem with this, is that I think many British citizens actually *enjoy* the benefits of being members of the EU - it's just that very few parties are point blank willing to give an in/out vote on EU membership (which UKIP professes to want, then proclaims that one of its policies is to point blank *leave* the EU if they were to gain a majority seat win in parliament), and crucially, not willing to address a creeping concern of cultural immersion that on the whole has been more successful on the European mainland.

I think the second problem with UKIP is something that many people have been asking for - none of them appear to be career politicians with a few exceptions. I believe *somewhere* in the hearts of UKIP councillors, they *want* to do the right thing, and improve the lives of the constituents - the problem is that their attitudes towards wider community are comical, somewhat akin to the tubbs of league of gentlemen claim, which is in no way conducive to progress - they fail to realise and understand on the whole that we can no longer live with the mentality of the England of old that we are an Empire, and that we remain an island in our own right...Globalisation isn't just around the corner; it's *happening*, and the sooner many people *accept* that, I think the happier we'll all be.",null,0,null,1424773521,null,0,false,0,covfd7i,null,t3_2wyune,null,t1_covfd7i,null,t1_cove1is,null,null,null,1424775615,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

null,false,Eljero,null,null,null,"Personally, I don't see him as being a big part of the plan next season for us at all, and i'd be a bit worried if we were thinking of him as one. Yes I think he has talent and am a fan, no I'm not afraid he's too old at 22, but I simply don't think he's good enough yet. You mention both Suso and Matic; Suso firstly, by all rights tore it up and had some great highlights playing for one of the worst squads in La Liga last year, and was deemed not good enough for the side this year. By all right we should be improving and in my opinion Suso at the start of this season was better than Teixeira will be next, but only time will tell that. Matic was absolutely starring for a top European team in every game and competition against every opposition, both players were finding a success in a completely different league, both literally and level of play wise. 

I also vastly disagree with you that simply playing on a better team would increase the stats of Teixeira, for example here is the stat line of a young forward over a few seasons and 3 different teams

2010-11 Team A: 21 games played 4 goals

2010-11 Team B: 12 gp 8 g

2011-12 Team A: 43 gp 13g

2012-13: Team A: 12 gp 2g

2012-12: Team C: 16gp 11G

This player is none other than our very own current star striker Daniel Sturridge, Team A is then Chelsea, B Bolton and C of course us. Now while we do understand that a good percentage of his games for Chelsea he was on the wing he all in all he scored 19 in 76 games for the club. The same season he went a pedestrian 4 in 21 (not stellar for a winger either, Ibe's 5 in 13[6 starts]) and at Bolton, a much lower quality team, found form and banged in 8 in 12. Similar stats following when he joined a much weaker Liverpool team that finished well outside the top 4 after finding life hard at Chelsea again. I agree with the opinion i'm sure that you're already thinking, yes of course him being shifted up top and played in his preferred striker role was one of or perhaps the main factor(s) for him scoring more. However you can't look at his stats for the better team and reason that almost certainly yes he would have more goals/assists. The Sturridge example isn't perfect of course but it was the quickest I could think of, i'm sure if you look at Neymars last couple of seasons with Santos vs his First in Barcelona it would be similar. There are a lot more factors to stats then simply playing on a good team, look at Danny Ings with Burnley right now, Andy Carroll with Newcastle, and so on and so forth. There are loads of players who light it up for teams struggling in a division, make the jump to a higher team and don't find those same prolific performances. Another example is Joe Allen, who had a great year with Swansea before us, hardly lit the world on fire at a higher level. Adam Lallana is now starting to settle and appear to hit form but struggled to replicate the form from his old club as well. No example is perfect but they all are in some way relevant to my point that I think just playing on a better team does not automatically or even very likely give you better stats, I actually tend to think the opposite.

&gt;Around five per cent or 800,000 men in the country are victims of domestic violence in comparison to 1.2 million women.

&gt;Yet the UK only has 33 dedicated male refuge spaces compared to 4,000 available to women.

&gt;Stephen Potts, a fundraising consultant linked to the project, said: “There is a sever lack of bed space for male victims of domestic violence, not just in Cornwall but throughout the country.

They have to work but they also need to look after their kids, which means little chance of doing over time/working on weekends which gets you a head in the job market.

In addition they'll need to take days off when their kids are sick or during school holidays. This is also limiting because most jobs aren't that flexible - which leads to many single mothers taking up jobs that have flexible hours or are part time. These jobs generally by their nature are low paying and have limited career progression. The labour market is so competitive now if you can't commit 100%  to work you'll struggle. Obviously child care exists but in the UK childcare is one of the most expensive in europe so that's another pull on your income.

I'm not saying that this is an excuse for the women in the article to sit about and do nothing - but I also think that in general we way over value the importance of paid work and way undervalue the importance of 'caring' work - child rearing/house work. Raising kids properly has an undeniable benefit to society (hopefully helping to raise skilled people who can go off support the economy). It's not easy.

*'The spurs'

*'The Hotspurs'

*banging on about Yedlin like he is Messi would he isnt even currently good enough to make the bench

*saying how great the new stadium will be even though they havent been to the Lane

*upvote parties

*wishing each other happy thanks giving

*posting US tv ratings. are you trying to sell me advertising space or something?

*using american sporting terms like 'mvp or 'go ahead goal' rather than learning the correct lingo

*moaning about the cost of postage from the spurs official shop. its not that bad in comparison to NFL/MLB/NHL postage to the UK.

*one even said something along the lines of 'im glad i support a small team like tottenham rather than man united or chelsea.' mate, your not supporting leyton orient.

*telling people where to buy fake shirts. how do you even support the club? you dont go to games, you probably watch streams online. what actual good are you to the club for moving forward?

*the seemingly endless 'who should i get out my shirt' threads and pics of shirts you got in the mail. great well done mate but i know what one looks like. 

*FIFA posts. yes I play fifa but seriously post that in the fifa sub or something

I dont hate americans, infact im going to new york in September. I love the NFL and havent missed a game at wembley, but i think i have posted in my teams sub twice in the whole time i've been on reddit. I'm even going to attend an MLS game out there!

 I would argue that a core function of any bank is to manage risk appropriately. 

Banks were transferring or obfuscating risk through the use of highly complex, opaque derivatives. When those MBS derivatives went pear shaped in 2007 there was a *precipitous* decline in investor confidence, as you state, with massive consequences for the global economy.

In essence they reaped the rewards but left the wider economy to pick up the cost. Central banks have been forced into forbearance, ZIRP and QE which could ultimately shake confidence in currencies (to your point). 

The bottom line is **banks were simply not doing a core component of their job properly** because it was massively profitable for them to do so. And they have not adequately picked up the cost, because if they did they would be rendered insolvent and the entire global financial economy would seize up.  Their actions are simply too important for us to ignore. As I stated, salaries and bonuses account for a *massive, disproportionate* proportion of bank profits, are so are absolutely material here. If they are unable or unwilling to regulate how much ‘profit’ is paid out in this way, then we must force it on them.

Pay them a living wage (with London weighting if everyone agrees that's more reasonable) and then provide them with a flat or house in London close by parliament, transport between locations if needed, and so on.

In theory this is what MPs expenses provide but there's a reason why we don't (or at least haven't in the past) just given people their benefits as a lump sum. There are savings due to scale, and also people honestly can't be trusted to spend money or claim for expenses appropriately.

I would strongly favour a more socialised approach to MPs expenses. You can't just claim for any second home, you get one awarded to you and you don't get a choice. You don't get to hire your wife as a secretary, you get a secretary appointed to you. You don't hire a solicitor for government business, you have access to a public firm, etc etc.

I find it baffling that we just let MPs claim on stuff, and even more baffling that we're happy for them to pay for it out of pocket in the first place.

I also believe strongly that we should pay MPs a wage for ten years after they leave office, and ban them from private employment in that time.

null,false,WinterMay,null,null,null,"1) What country are you from and where in the country were you born? 

I'm from France and was born in Paris. 

2) What is your favorite food/dish from your country? 

I love any of our food involving tasty sauces, such as boeuf bourguignon or blanquette de veau. Crêpes are also delicious :)

3) What type of music is popular where you are from? Who is your favorite music artist? 

I think all kind of music are popular. We've got a couple of popular french singer/songwriters (such as Stromae, who is belgian, not french, BB Brunes or Fauve). Lots of french rappers are popular too but i'm not too familiar with those. 

I personally love pop rock, especially british bands. I'd say my favourites are Placebo and Bloc Party. 

4) Are there any holidays that you celebrate in your country that we do not in the United States? 

The dates differ for some like our national holiday (14 juillet, which is NOT called Bastille day in France) or labour day, but I think overall we don't differ too much. 

5) Are there holidays that are celebrated in the U.S. that are celebrated a bit differently in your country? 

Well, we don't do Thanksgiving at all ! Otherwise no, i don't think it differs too much (military parades, fireworks etc.)
For Easter the adults usually buy chocolate figures (could be eggs, or animals), and like to hide them in the house/garden for the youngest to look for. But maybe you do that in the US? 

We also have Mardi Gras (the date changes, it's between the 3rd of Feb. and 9th of March according to Wikipedia), where young people like to throw eggs and flour at each other. When I was younger it was a big thing, especially just outside of schools, but I think it was deemed a bit dangerous, not sure if people still do it.  

6) What is the most positive thing about being a member of your culture? 

French people are very proud of their heritage, and I think it's a positive thing. We have this whole concept of ""french cultural exception"". 

We also know how to appreciate good food and wine, and have an amazing dinner time with friends ! We also do the apéritif (called more familiarly apéro), it's usually a cocktail and some snacks eaten before dinner (dinner is usually at 8pm, and apéro at 7pm)

7) What are some things young people do for fun in your country? 

Depends where you live, big city or smaller town. It's not very original, sports, clubbing, loitering with friends while listening to music. Movies might be a bit too expensive for teenagers.

8) Are there any special customs involved with weddings/funerals/births where you are from? 

Nothing that comes to mind. Churches are probably less involved (i haven't been to many funerals, but those ceremonies I attended were never held in a church or religious environement). 

9) Are there any stereotypes about your country that you feel are not true? What are they? 

I've been told (by several american people on distinct occasions) that french people don't wash and that we wear perfume to mask our bad body odor. That's hilarious and ofc totally untrue.

We have a reputation of not being welcoming of non french speaking people. I've personally never noticed it and love to help out tourists in Paris, but i've been told hundred of stories of the contrary, which always makes me sad :( 

10) If you had any advice to give to someone who is about to go to your country for the first time, what would it be?

Eh, it's more advice i'd give to anyone travelling to any country really : don't be afraid of trying new stuff, enjoy the local food, learn some basic vocabulary of the language (hello / good bye / thank you / please / sorry), people will switch to english if they see you struggle but appreciate the effort, know how to be safe. 

If you do run into rude french people, just let it slide. It's not representative of the country, eventhough we do love to complain :)",null,0,null,1424774666,null,0,1424775045,0,covfkuf,null,t3_2wyfb8,null,t1_covfkuf,null,t3_2wyfb8,null,null,null,1424775713,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Those air -conditioned, bright canteens, 

Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans, 

Tinned minds, tinned breath.

Mess up the mess they call a town-

A house for ninety-seven down

And once a week a half a crown 

For twenty years.

Who'll always cheat and always win, 

Who washes his repulsive skin 

In women's tears:

And smash his desk of polished oak

And smash his hands so used to stroke

And stop his boring dirty joke

And make him yell.


But spare the bald young clerks who add

The profits of the stinking cad;

It's not their fault that they are mad, 

They've tasted Hell.

It's not their fault they do not know 


The birdsong from the radio, 

It's not their fault they often go 

To Maidenhead

And talk of sport and makes of cars

In various bogus-Tudor bars 

And daren't look up and see the stars

But belch instead.

In labour-saving homes, with care

Their wives frizz out peroxide hair

And dry it in synthetic air

And paint their nails.

Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough

To get it ready for the plough.

I see exactly why you should hold no love for people like these but by giving them no home to go to you're only proving that ISIS -is- the only place for them to go and they will fight all the harder for it. 

This is not a simple matter that can be solved with ""let them go"" we should not let them go and join a terrorist organization but try and sit them down and prove to them the horrors this will cause, bloodshed, at all costs must be prevented.  

What EliCaash is saying is that by making these people stateless you leave them open to the atrocities of war, why would you allow this? Are they lesser people because they believe something different than you? Do they deserve less rights? 

Active terrorists must be stopped and unfortunately our only way of doing so at the present moment is through the spilling of blood, on both sides, something I'd rather was not the case but we must be realistic. 

All in all, I believe what you say as your opinion and it's certainly a valid one, I just can't condone the act of ISIS making these people criminals and murderers, which will be all the easier should they no longer have a home to go to. 

That being said, making them stateless would help identify them as terrorists upon reentry into the UK, the list would be large but not as large as the general public and this would make it easier to ascertain who is dangerous and who is not.

I said it was hard to. It *is* hard to. These are people who make concious decisions to go and hurt people or help organisations that hurt people. Excuse me if my compassion is low for them.

&gt; but by giving them no home to go to you're only proving that ISIS -is- the only place for them to go and they will fight all the harder for it. 

Cause and effect are a bit mixed up there though, aren't they? If you *don't* go and join ISIS (or whoever) you're most welcome. If you do then you've made your decision and should understand you're giving up any other home you have. If you decide to drop out you can be charged as a war criminal or similar - it should be that clear cut. 

The idea - in my mind - is to make anyone think twice and make it absolutely clear to them the gravity of their choice. 

&gt; you leave them open to the atrocities of war, why would you allow this? Are they lesser people because they believe something different than you? Do they deserve less rights? 

Their beliefs don't make them lesser - their own acts of atrocity do. ISIS is not a good or kind group. They're not simply 'a bit different to us'. In joining them and becoming terrorists they themselves leave their victims open to the atrocities of war. 

&gt; I just can't condone the act of ISIS making these people criminals and murderers

I see your point and you do put it across well - but IMO these people should know what they're getting in to when they join ISIS. 

If we as a country are showing a kind and welcoming approach to anyone who thought they'd go and sign up then found they made a mistake well... how far does that go?

The thing that everyone sees is that you have games in ""High Skill"" for a majority, which suggests you're at least 1000 MMR lower than you say, which is a big jump in skill difference.

Not everyone cares so much about MMR, instead they care more about why someone would lie about such a thing. If someone believes they are much better than they are, they typically don't see their own mistakes and improve slower as a result ontop of generally being unreliable due to the lying.

A theme in my thinking recently has been how fucking idiotic markets are, and the UK oil industry is a wonderful case study.  During the mid 90's prices were near record lows, and so in order to cover opex oil companies pumped as much as they possibly could.  This essentially led to the UK producing, and exporting, most of our oil when its value was absolutely rock bottom, leading to [this situation](http://www.euanmearns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/uk_oil_production+value.png).  Perhaps a more sensible solution would have been to keep some oil in the ground for times when it wasn't so plentiful.

One of the key differences between our industry and that of Saudi Arabia is that Saudi Aramco generates revenue, not profit, and thus they're much more concerned with stable long term flows, as opposed to wringing all they can as fast as they can.  This has meant that Saudi's supergiant fields have been stewarded much better than ours in the north sea.  Indeed if we'd been on top of Ghawar I expect it would be depleted by now, and had the Brent field been well taken care of I imagine the EOR would be a fair bit higher.

Once these cat cafes have launched you’ll still have to pay to use them. I don’t get the impression there’s a year’s free access for backers or something like that? 

People launch cafés relatively frequently – they’re not a new thing – though the cats are. This new trend in people wanting funding to launch their café… well that makes me wonder why they can’t do it on their own. Is it not a good business model? Are they not confident? 

I know I’m being cynical but it does make it easy to get free money.

Really?? Then she shouldn't have had kids for fuck's sake! Why do so many people think that just because a woman has kids, that they're then entitled to *so much* money after the divorce? 

Assets should be split down the middle and shared out and then some child support should be paid until the kids hit 16 or 18. After that she shouldn't be entitled to any more money. The same goes for any man who stays at home looking after the kids whilst the woman works. He shouldn't be entitled to any more after the asset split. 

They were adults who entered into a marriage contract and then had children. If they didn't want this shit to happen, they should never have had any fucking kids!

So many entitled douchebags out there who think that just because they had kids, they're entitled to a disproportionate amount of cash for their 'sacrifice'. Pff.

Credit cards are fantastic tools **if you can manage them**. Otherwise they can be incredibly expensive.

Have you read the budgeting guide?

A great example of the issue with monthly-end budgeting is the ""need a tyre"" point. New tyres should not be an emergency. Every car will need consumables replacing every now and then. By treating this as an emergency, you haven't planned for it in advance, and you will find it very hard to get on top of your budget. However, if, in advance, you assume your ""car maintenance"" pot will need funding with, say, £50 per month, it will not be an emergency when you need £400 for a set of new tyres next year.

http://budgetbrain.moneysavingexpert.com is a great place to start to get a ""big picture"" idea of your outgoings. It includes categories for absolutely everything, including things you might never think of, and breaks them down into an overall monthly cost.

In direct response to your proposal, savings and bills shouldn't come from the same place.

Let's say you go through the budget brain as stated above, and it transpires that you have net income of £1,500 per month, of which your total bills cost is £800 per month. 

The pay yourself first methodology would be to, say, allow £200 for out of pocket and put £500 away on payday. You would only move any money back from that if you *needed to*. Psychologically, it's much easier to spend money in your current account, than move it from a savings pot back to be spent.

I would also mention that you should prioritise clearing your debt. There is very little point in having savings and debts at the same time.

Labour's supporters aren't like that. I generally found most Labour supporters came from Labour families that had always voted Labour.

I find most voters are stereotypical, especially in strongholds. Scotland until recently was such a stronghold, for Labour. True swing voters are few and far between, which is sad because I think we'd be in a better place if people read all the party manifestos and voted for the policy set they liked the most, rather than the tribal and image-based methods most use. I've yet to start reading them all myself but I'd like to think (or hope!) that I'll give them all a fair read and choose what appeals to me most. I'm sure I have a bias in me somewhere that'll draw me towards one party or another, but still I'd like to read everyone's and try to pick fairly.

What I was trying to say in my reply was Labour/Green supporters can generally (in my experience) be divided by being wanting to be seen as ""non-mainstream"" (for Greens, which is probably why they enjoy much higher support among students) and having loyalty and a trust that (for Labour) the party will always, on average, make the 'average person' better off if they're voted in.

I'm sure there's a stereotypical Tory voter to be found as well but being a Scot I can't really say I've met one. They're few and far between up here and the majority of people interested in centre-right policies vote for the SNP here, because their ideology produces many policies a Tory-leaning individual might find appealing.

Indeed, SNP voters I've found to be the most diverse (and I'm not one of them). On one hand you've got their old bread and butter voters who tended to be people that might've otherwise voted Conservative, while post-Referendum you've also got a huge influx of people who would've otherwise probably been Labour voters who have now this idea that the SNP's brand of ""civic nationalism"" and talk of (though in my opinion little demonstrable action of...) wealth redistribution and a ""Scandinavian"" model means they're taken over Labour's mantle as the champion of the common man.",null,0,null,1424779153,null,0,1424779374,0,covgi0d,null,t3_2wz3tv,null,t1_covgi0d,null,t1_covgaha,null,null,null,1424780491,null,1,true,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

than Mills and Boon!



&gt;Sir John - oh, what a sense of farce!
A poet of the teacup class
obsessed with railways, and stained glass
and twisted bough and thus impervious to the call of the post-war suburban sprawl
of Harlow, Basildon and all
and glorious Slough!

home of a thousand training schemes
and theme pubs, patronised by streams
Of tetchy men with blow-dried hair and blow-dried brain
diplomas in inflicting pain
and ne'er a thought for Larkin, Raine
and Betjeman!

&gt;A thousand jewellers' shops contend
The kitchen unit is your friend
Designer labels set the trend
with a blank stare
And now - the latest, brightest star -
a brand new ten screen cinema!
The folk will come from near and far
to worship there!

&gt;Oh self-made, independent town!
The jewel in Margaret's southern crown!
No more will poets put you down

This town is fit for heroes now -

Undoubtedly you are correct. However once you have renounced your citizenship you forfeit the right to do so.

Certainly the law regards those who are 17 or younger differently to those who are 18 or older, yes, and they should have the right to argue in court if they didn't understand what they were doing when they went to fight against their country for a terrorist state.

Why not? Inexperience is not an excuse for murder and whether younger than 18 or not any teenager without severe mental retardation will know this.

I can't blame them for wanting to be a part of something greater, I do not believe in their choice to harm others, I do believe there is something lacking for these people to join ISIS instead of trying a different method to give their lives worth. That is all that statement meant.

Your last statement """"because of having made this choice they are lesser."""" makes it seem like you think them lesser. They are not any greater or any less of a person than you are, simply misguided individuals. 

I am not excusing this behavior nor do I condone it in any fashion. Murder is possibly the vilest act I can think of, torture a close second. People are subject to the mistakes they have made but they deserve justice rather than hatred, understanding will only help prevent this type of thing happening again in the future, should we be able to open ourselves to these teenagers in a way that it is safe for them to speak about their thoughts we may be able to discourage them joining and ultimately stem the flow of blood that this conflict is causing and perhaps again in the future. 

By stating that these people are lesser you'll cause people to become reserved, to bottle these emotions instead of expressing them. It is hard to argue a point no-one is willing to speak about and if they do not speak about it, they'll be all the more likely to join up, in my opinion. 

You do make very good points, I understand what you're saying and indeed you put it forwards in a way that it is easy to understand albeit a little blunt but sometimes that is needed. (especially for me, I can be a bit of a blockhead at times).

It's hard to say what is the right and wrong action in this regard, perhaps you're right and I shouldn't be trying to be as understanding of their predicament, acting on what we know rather than emotion is certainly a viable way to achieve victory over those who would threaten and attack us but ultimately, I prefer the road not stained red and that is where I see them laying if they continue to join ISIS, they cannot achieve victory over Britain and her allies.",null,0,null,1424781124,null,0,false,0,covgz45,null,t3_2wz2zg,null,t1_covgz45,null,t1_covgmtl,null,null,null,1424782571,null,1,true,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

1)I'm from the UK, from a town between the cities of Liverpool and Manchester in the North West of England.

2)Favourite food is tricky. Maybe Kedgeree, (a smoked fish and spiced rice salad), Lancashire hotpot (A lamb or beef stew) with a suet pastry pie-crust, or syrup sponge pudding.

3)I'm really out of touch. Lots of rock bands are native to this region, from the Beatles to Oasis. Indie music is very popular, as is dance and house music. I like all that but I'm more into folk music, like the 60s revival artists such as Sandy Denny, I also like Garage, Dub, and Drum n Bass too. 

4)From what I think I know about USA: Pancake day, St. George's day, May Day, Harvest Festival (not sure if you have that, it's very minor here), Guy Fawkes Night, Boxing Day. That applies to England only, other parts of the UK have different days.

5)I think Christmas is a bigger deal, we seem to have a lot of different foods here that you don't have judging by films. Mince pies, Christmas Pudding, Mulled wine, etc. Hallowe'en in the UK is more popular in some parts than others. Some regions don't celebrate it at all and put more emphasis on Guy Fawkes which happens about a week later. And its strictly scary/supernatural costumes, I see Americans dress up as all kinds of things. 

6) Nice vein of cynicism runs through most spheres of life. No pressure to be too positive if you don't want, it's lovely.

7) Football probably the most popular for boys at least. The cliché thing is drinking cheap cider on the park, that's a rite of passage for most British kids, maybe 14-16yo or so? 

8)Not sure that they differ significantly from the US. It's hard to know what's uniqu about your own culture when it just feels normal to you. I *think* that maybe our wakes are a little more drunken than yours! Oh and for some reason all women wear hats at weddings.

9)English people seem to be stereotyped by the tiny minority that make up our upper classes. We *are* very class conscious, and have a cultural identity tied to our class. However, since most of us are descended from working or middle class stock, we are more prone to reverse snobbery, and try actively to appear down-to-earth. That's my theory anyway, I think it explain a lot of the rougher edges of English culture, like the binge drinking and the general distrust of high art.

10)If people are polite to you, you've done something wrong. If people are insulting you, chances are they like you. Don't be afraid to engage in cheeky jokes with people.

On the one hand, £67,000 really isn't much round there. Compared to other professionals living there, the MP does not do well, despite working similar hours and being under much more public pressure. 

On the other hand, Sir Malcolm's expectation of what a decent salary is may well be warped by the fact that he is surrounded by the very wealthiest people, not just in Britain, but the entire world. Should the public purse be expected to compete with inflated directors' and company officers' salaries? For people from deprived backgrounds, £67k is a perfectly decent wage to aspire to. For those already with lucrative jobs, it should be the lure of public service and an interesting career, not money, that attracts them. Many MPs have been happy to make the transition from more lucrative careers.

The solution I favour is to peg the MP's salary against the earnings of other community leaders (e.g. headteachers), with some London weighting to reflect the amount of working hours they spend in the capital. I think that might put them on more than they earn now, but not quite six figures.

Spending on new North Sea oil and gas projects is to plunge by a third this year, industry operators warned on Tuesday, with the basin draining cash at its fastest rate since the 1970s.

In a bleak assessment of Britain’s future as an energy producer, Oil &amp; Gas UK, which represents the offshore industry, says that rising costs, heavy taxes and a near-50 per cent slide in crude prices could lead to accelerated decommissioning of older fields.

“Without sustained investment in new and existing fields, critical infrastructure will disappear, taking with it important North Sea hubs, effectively sterilising areas of the basin and leaving oil and gas in the ground,” said Malcolm Webb, chief executive of the group. Another couple of years of low prices “could take a terrible toll on the North Sea”.

Its annual survey of operators, published on Tuesday, says that at $50 a barrel a fifth of oil production on the UK continental shelf — and a third of fields — is lossmaking on a cash basis. The industry suffered negative cash flow of £5.3bn last year as soaring running costs outweighed revenues.

Capital spending on new fields is forecast to fall sharply to between £9.5bn and £11.3bn this year, from 2014’s £14.8bn, while investment in projects that have already been given the go-ahead is at risk of “collapse”, to £2.5bn, by 2018.

The report’s findings echo warnings from senior industry figures, including Royal Dutch Shell’s Ben van Beurden and BP’s Bob Dudley, who have called for tax cuts in next month’s Budget to help reverse declining exploration and production.

Offshore UK oil and gas output fell 1.1 per cent in 2014 to 1.42m barrels of oil per day equivalent, extending a longer-term slide albeit at the slowest rate since 2000. Investments made before the oil price began to drop means that up to 15 fields could begin production this year and output could recover before resuming its decline in the next decade.

But the slump in exploration has worsened, with only 14 out of an expected 25 wells drilled last year, the lowest number since oil was first found in the 1960s, and as few as eight forecast for 2015. Mr Webb called the slide “exceptionally worrying”.

“The basin is not generating new projects and, as a result, there is very little fresh investment,” he said. “Unless things change, we can see sanctioned development spending beginning to tail off very seriously.”

The Treasury needed to cut supplementary corporation tax on oil revenues and deliver on a commitment to simplify field investment allowances, said Mr Webb.

The tumble in internationally traded Brent crude, from more than $115 a barrel last summer to less than $60, has had an acute impact on the economics of the North Sea’s smaller, ageing fields. These were already deemed a riskier bet because of a complex fiscal regime, recent tax hikes and difficulties in accessing infrastructure.

Big operators are scrambling to cut costs, announcing redundancies, slashing contractors’ pay rates, freezing development plans and demanding workers agree to new shift patterns that will require them to spend more time offshore. Oil &amp; Gas UK estimates that savings of 40 per cent are needed to give the basin a viable future.

Should prices stay at current levels, companies could bring forward decisions to cease production and begin to decommission more older fields, as Shell has started doing with the Brent field, once one of the UK’s biggest. Mr Webb said this would make it harder to tap reserves whose development depended on access to existing platforms and pipelines.

He expected a rise of 6 per cent in the number of fields slated to cease production over the next five years as high costs and lower revenues meant their economic value to operators diminished to less than their decommissioning liability. Total spending on decommissioning was revised upwards to £46bn by 2040.

Some 10bn barrels of oil equivalent have been reported as recoverable from the North Sea by oil and gas companies, of which 6.3bn are already in production or being developed. Those identified as possible investments have been cut from 4bn boe to 3.7bn and, of these, less than 2bn boe are now likely to be developed.

-------------------------------------------

Drilling down

Higher oil prices would usually lead to more North Sea drilling, but that ceased to be the case after the 2008-09 financial crisis.

The credit crunch left many companies unable to finance exploration even when crude prices were high, at over $100 a barrel. Then after a brief recovery, in 2011 the government raised the so-called supplementary charge on oil revenues, adding another 12 percentage points to the overall corporation tax burden. That killed the rebound in exploration on the UK continental shelf, which then fell to a record low.

Oil &amp; Gas UK says there is no shortage of promising geological prospects. The problem is simply that post-tax returns on exploratory drilling “are just not competitive” in the UK. In Norway, for example, oil companies benefit from a 78 per cent rebate on every dollar spent on exploration. There is no such refund in Britain.

Last year’s government-commissioned review by Sir Ian Wood, the Aberdeen-based oil billionaire, concluded that a more flexible licensing regime and improved access to seismic data were part of the answer to how to arrest the decline in North Sea exploration. But it said fiscal measures to boost the post-tax value of drilling would also be needed.

Hence the proposed basin-wide investment allowance, to be introduced in the Budget. Without such incentives, it is “very unlikely” even the lower end of estimated volumes yet to be found — some 2bn to 3bn barrels of oil equivalent — will be discovered, Tuesday’s report says.

The cost of drilling wells, competition for resources and difficulties accessing rigs have also constrained activity. Last year companies postponed 17 wells and cancelled a further four that were due to be drilled from 2014 to 2016. Big companies were busier than smaller competitors, suggesting the latter have been struggling to raise capital.

The number of semi-submersible drilling rigs in the UK has therefore fallen, to just 18 in January, while daily rig rates, or what it costs to hire them, has declined over the past year. Though rates for jackup rigs rose, they are expected to fall this year.",null,0,null,1424782776,null,0,false,0,covhfnb,null,t3_2wz1mi,null,t1_covhfnb,null,t3_2wz1mi,null,null,null,1424782786,null,1,true,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I have, therefore, agreed with them that High Court proceedings be taken against Mr Smart for the return of any documents and to restrain him from any further publication of council documents.”

To be an MP you have to sacrifice half your salary. This means that you will only attract people who want to be an MP so badly they are willing to sacrifice a large part of their potential income. That may include the odd very self-sacrificing individual, willing to pay the high price necessary to be an MP. But it will also include many more rich people who can very easily do without half of their salary (or even all of it), likely the kind of people who have entered politics to advance their own vested interests or those of their associates. We don't want any more of those people running the country than necessary.

3) I'm not very up-to-date on popular music but I used to be really into heavy metal and the UK has produced many famous heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motörhead and Whitesnake.

4) I think other people have already mentioned these: Burns Night, Guy Fawkes Night or Bonfire Night, Remembrance Sunday and National Patron Saints Days.

5) In Scotland, New Year's Eve is celebrated as ""Hogmanay"" which is similar to American celebrations (drinking, dancing, etc.) but also has a lot of other traditions associated with it, such as ""first-footing"" (being the first person to visit a house after New Year and bringing a traditional gift). The first and second of January are public holidays, which should give you an idea of how serious Scottish people take their New Year celebrations!

6) Hard to say. My Scottish culture? My British culture? My European culture?

7) Attend scientific lectures, take drugs, go to the cinema, have sex, visit art galleries, steal cars and go for a ""joyride"", attend sporting events, get drunk, play music, etc.

8) Of course! Though these are more likely to depend on the religion of the people involved rather than the country they are in. A Sikh wedding in the UK will be more like a Sikh wedding in the USA than it will a Catholic wedding in the UK.

&gt;2007. ""Missing Day"".
&gt;Jack in 2007.
&gt;Gwen narrates that working for Torchwood, it's a rather normal night on the job; instead of an alien as usual, she's chasing a mysterious stranger with her boss, Jack. However, Jack gets ahead of her in the chase, chasing the unknown figure behind some vents on a roof. However, once Gwen gets there, she discovers that Jack and the unknown target are missing, and all that's left is a mysterious green gas being sucked up by the fans. Gwen radios Tosh, informing her that Jack's been kidnapped.

She did discredit herself, but the degree to which she discredited herself is still bugger all compared to anything that comes out of Miliband or Cameron's mouths.

Again, they export a lot of their energy, and have recieved pieces of paper back in return for it, which I believe is a fantastic way of impoverishing yourself very rapidly, though they have done a better job of ensuring that their wealth is distributed equitably throughout the population, which is to be admired.  I'm less convinced than others about the value of their soveriegn wealth fund to be honest.  As far as I'm concerned it's basically a very good way for the norwegian government to pay large management fees to financial proefssionals without ever accomplishing anything meaningful.

They've also blown an absolutely stonking [private debt bubble](http://fractionalflow.com/2014/06/14/norways-petroleum-economy-struggles-with-declining-debt-productivity/) during the boom years since 2005 or so, which might see them in trouble if low prices persist.

Sorry to hear that, keep at it! Finding work up here is very hard, so the best thing you can do is maximise the opportunities available to you. Make sure you're CV is tight, on every jobsite and in the hand of every recruitment agent and every family member or friend who is lucky enough to be in work. Make speculative applications to every company in the area you want to work for, ideally turning up in person if you feel confident (With CV, cover letter and a bit of knowledge of the company). Searching keywords for your preferred industry in google maps can sometimes give you leads for nearby businesses you might not have heard of.
