In the last week I've read The Hobbit for the first time in... umm, 28 years and I'm now around a third through the Lord of The Rings. I don't think they really need descriptions, do they? 

After that I plan to finish Dracula's Guest, which is a set of short stories by Bram Stoker (I only have around 30 pages left, I just couldn't finish it last year as sometimes the stories take a while to grab me and I wasn't in the mood) and then I'm moving back to read some unread works by an Australian historical novelist called Thomas Keneally. He wrote Schindler's List so he should be quite well known; I've read two or three of his other novels and they are charming and very well written. 

WEEKLY.

null,false,ZombieWomble,null,null,null,"&gt; IF IF IF blood from gay men carries a higher risk of infection it should not be used for that reason and that reason only.

A couple of points:

1) If you extrapolate the worst-case increase in risk from the UK-wide study of moving MSM down to the lower risk category to NI's population, it works out as a little less than two additional HIV-infected units making it through screening for every hundred million units of blood processed. For perspective, that corresponds to about 1 additional infected unit being processed in Northern Ireland every thousand years, assuming our technology never improves from this moment. 

The baseline scenario indicates effectively no increase in risk (expected value of 0.5% increase in risk of an infected donation not being caught, which corresponds to fewer than 1 infected transfusion every 10,000 years), and there are scenarios were changing these rules actually reduces the risk of infected samples, due to better compliance. These are not significant population level risks by any stretch of the imagination. [Source](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216109/dh_129909.pdf)

2) The current policy places men who have sex with men in an absurdly strict risk category compared to other activities. Under the current system, having sex with any man is apparently a significantly higher risk factor than having sex with a woman *known to be infected with HIV*. If your argument is about risk management, then the current system is simply not rational, and I believe that was one of the key reasons why the ban was originally ruled against.",null,0,null,1420753949,null,0,false,0,cnisyvv,null,t3_2rr7ee,null,t1_cnisyvv,null,t1_cnio1ku,null,null,null,1424984996,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

null,false,chrisward125,,Newtownards,null,"My fiancee and I also went with co-ownership for our house which we bought back in 2012. It was a really straight forward process.

A couple of things that would be good to be aware of:

1. The system might have changed slightly since we went through it but we found the house we wanted to buy first so we knew the rough numbers for the co-ownership forms. The forms are quite simple and you'll need a copy of your credit report - one for yourself and your partner (£2 from Experian).

2. You can't have more than £5000 worth of collective debt excluding student loans. We had a car on finance which meant we had to pay off a certain amount to get it below that level.

3. Be careful with estate agents offering their services as financial advisors. Reed Rains tried to pull this one on us. They offered their services which amounted to filling in the co-owner forms and searching for a mortgage (they only use a few providers) which would have cost us £300. I told them to take a hike and arranged ours after having meetings with the Progressive, Northern and Ulster Banks. We eventually went with the Ulster Bank (My partner was in the add campaign) as it was the lowest rate with their co-ownership scheme and also meant we didn't have to add a deposit. (We did add a 5% deposit and I would recommend it if you can as it will save you in the long run.)


4. After you send your forms in if everything is fine you'll be invited to an interview beside RBAI in Belfast. It is just a brief chat and if they have accepted the forms with no problem then you will have no hassle.

5. The fee for co-ownership is about £250 - this includes your application fee and solicitor outlay. You will have another £200 ish to pay to your solicitor's expenses. Be wary of mortgage charges, some are worse than others - if you have a Northern Bank account they waive the charge.

&gt;Well the insane xenophobic policies are things like leaving the EU even though EU migrants bring more into the British than they take away

Leaving the EU is nowhere near xenophobic. The figures that say they are a net benefit doesn't include various expenses, which makes the figures quite irrelevant.

They said that about the IndyRef too, even when Scotland wants to be in the EU. The EU is basically a cheap labour store for big businesses in the UK.

Cutting it to countries like India, who are a very rapidly growing economy, who have a space program when we ourselves don't. It would only be essential aid to things like Ebola or a big natural disaster like the one in Haiti.

&gt;Also their bizarre complaint about PC language. 

Is there an issue with using non PC language? I personally don't think so.

&gt;The insane non-xenophobic policies are their complete denial of climate change, cutting of workers' rights and opening grammar schools to further increase inequality.

Which manifesto from the past year has explicitly denied the existence of climate change? They most certainly do not want to reduce workers' rights. Opening grammar schools would increase equality, since at the moment there is a huge shortage of them, so only the upper middle classes can get into them, which would drive house prices up in the area.

4-3-3:

Forwards: Markovic-Sturridge-Sterling. We have the striker we need in Sturridge.  Sterling is so much better on the right.Next season with Origi backing him up even if he is not prolific the movement and pressing will still be available so no more 3-4-3. (Sterling has also proven to be an option)

A midfield of Can-Hendo-Coutinho will be more than mobile enough to protect the defense in the absence of Gerrard. Lallana and Coutinho rotate based on form/opposition. Lucas will be a great backup option.

Defense: Moreno-Sakho-???-Flanagan.  I'm not writing off Lovren but Skrtel probably fills out the defense for me.

I didn't really like *Good Omens*, to be honest.  While I'm a massive Pratchett fan, Gaiman doesn't really do it for me.  Also, I've read almost all of Christopher Moore's output, and it turns out Pratchett + Gaiman = Moore, although Moore is American.  I highly recommend his books if you enjoyed *Good Omens* though.

Over the last week I've read two books.  One was *Of Mice and Men* though, which is only just over a hundred pages long.  I know a lot of you were probably assigned it for GCSE English, but I was in the higher class and we read *Lord of the Flies* instead.  *Of Mice and Men* was just perfect though, one of those books that makes you think '*this* is why I read', and in my case '*this* is why I love short fiction'.  There's nothing you could add or take away that would make that book better; perfect is the only word I can use to adequately describe it.

I also read *Dicken's Ghost Stories*, which includes, among others, *A Christmas Carol*, which is another example of a story that's exactly the right length.  If you made that into a full-length novel, it'd be horribly saccharine, but as a novella it works wonderfully.  The only story I can say I found even a little bit creepy was 'The Trial for Murder', and I even laughed out loud at an early part of 'The Haunted House' (' 'Ooded woman with a howl,' said Ikey, in a state of great freshness.  'Do you mean a cry?'  'I mean a bird, sir.').  Special mention too for the brilliantly crafted 'The Ghost in the Bride's Chamber'.  You may be noticing a pattern in that Dickens' later stories were the superior ones.  That's just the way.

Next up... I don't know.  I'm considering Kafka's Complete Short Stories, but I fear they'll make me dreadfully depressed if read in January.  *The Handmaid's Tale*, maybe?  Margaret Atwood was very lovely at her recent AMA and she answered my question about *The Penelopiad*, one of the best retellings of an existing story, IMO.  Perhaps *Captain Corelli's Mandolin*, I'm in the mood for something where the writing is the thing.  At any rate, I got Grimm's *Complete Fairy Tales* for Christmas, which is a doorstop of a book, so I'll probably start that soon and keep it going on the backburner for a month or two.",null,0,null,1420755269,null,0,false,0,cnitr1h,null,t3_2rs8tf,null,t1_cnitr1h,null,t3_2rs8tf,null,null,null,1424983376,null,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2,null

It was direct command from God. It was not a reflection of the actions of man. God specifically directed the Israelites to take the virgin girls as sex slaves and to kill the older women who were not virgins. 

Also, as you may have spotted in that thread, Biblical explicitly endorsed both the 7 year long indentured servitude (unless you get married in which case you get your ear pierced and you're a slave for life) and the literal chattel type of slavery (for non-Israelites). I don't know where you got the notion that Biblical law ultimately ended slavery, but I can assure that it's false. 

In Britain, Wilberforce and his friends were inspired by their faith to argue against slavery, but they did not argue from Biblical sources, or on point of Biblical law - they made moral arguments that they felt it was their Christian duty to do. Indeed, parts of the Bible were consistently used to defend slavery throughout the American south.

That being said, using Hillsborough as an example for how police portrayals can be inaccurate isn't wrong. But using it as an example to show how Evans's rape case could be wrong is so stupid. Let's hear the evidence in the Evans case, then?

[this one] (https://m.boots.com/h5/cat_hub) is a lot richer &amp; very nourishing as it's designed &amp; marketed for more mature skin which can be a lot drier. 

I haven't tried the Lift &amp; Luminate sheet mask so can't say whether it's worth the money but £18 is a hell of a lot of money for 1 mask (at least I think it only contains 1 mask). From looking on the website it has mixed reviews so I'm hesitant to suggest you give it a whirl.

Last year I read 26 books in total. A lot of those were literature from a course I was studying and included such classics as [The Cruicible](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucible-Play-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141182555/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420757399&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+crucible), [Maus](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-MAUS-Art-Spiegelman/dp/0141014083/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420757443&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=maus) and [Lolita](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lolita-Penguin-Classics-Craig-Raine/dp/0141182539/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420757468&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lolita) to name a few of my favorites. 

A large amount of my other reading was biology/physiology related books to do with my degree, which I will spare you all from here, save one honourable mention to a complete story of cancer research and treatment starting from it's inception to relatively present day. The book is called [The Emperor of all Maladies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/0007250924/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420757567&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+emperor+of+all+maladies) and it is a ""biography"" of cancer and it's treatment written by a very prolific caner researcher. It has loads of really heartwarming (and emotional) first hand stories and really gives you a up close and personal look at the world of cancer without you necessarily needing a scientific mind. 

This year I want to get a bit more casual with my reading, maybe lay off the science so much and read more for fun again. I have been meaning to go back to the [Artemis Fowl](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Artemis-Fowl-Eoin-Colfer/dp/0141339098/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420757694&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=artemis+fowl) series as I really enjoyed it as a kid.

**Major Parties (UK):** Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats

**Major Parties (England and Wales):** Con, Lab, Lib Dem plus Ukip

**Major Parties (Scotland):** Con, Lab, Lib Dem plus the SNP

**Major Parties (Wales):** Con, Lab, Lib Dem plus Plaid Cymru


(There is also a whole separate category for Northern Ireland, who have a different set of parties altogether.)

Their reasons for these categories also very clear cut, based on past performance and current polling. They're scrupulously fair, as shown in their refusal to rank Ukip as the equal of the 'Big Three' nationally while accepting that they are now a 'major party' in England and Wales.

In light of this, Cameron's insistence that the debates not go ahead without the Greens is totally bogus: They're *not* a major party.

*However*, it's also clear that Ukip aren't a major party *nationally*. If they are to be included in 'national' TV debates when they aren't a national party, there's a clear problem: There would have to be another set of TV debates in Scotland and Wales, taking into account the respective status of the various parties in those regions, while the 'Big 3 + Ukip' debate would have to be for England and Wales only and clearly labelled as such.

My opinion has always been that Wales and Scotland should get their own debates but the inclusion of Ukip in 'England and Wales' but not 'UK' makes the whole thing different, with either inconsistencies or a weird overlap between any possible debates (do you have 'Wales', 'England and Wales' and 'UK' debates?).

* Thorium fuels can breed fissile uranium-233 to be used in various kinds of nuclear reactors.
* Molten salt reactors are well suited to thorium fuel, as normal fuel fabrication is avoided.

What is not mentioned is that Thorium's radioactive half life is significantly smaller than that of Uranium so it takes less time to store till it's inert and safe to dispose of. (100s of years as opposed to 1000s of years)

For Oxbridge, they definitely look at your GCSEs and use them to differentiate ""maybe"" candidates (who are borderline for interviews). 

For other universities it depends on the course. For example for economics at some Russell Group universities, they ask for a minimum A at GCSE maths (if you're not taking it at A level). Pretty much every course at these universities will have an unwritten, but expected minimum of C in maths and English language (but you've got that so you're fine).

As much as you'll want to stick your fingers in your ears and ignore - I think you're over estimating Liverpool's pulling power as a club, regardless of money. You haven't been consistently competing for the PL / CL in ages and players know that. People constantly snub Liverpool for teams like United / Arsenal / Chelsea because they know they will have a chance at winning trophies and playing in the champions league. Not looking to start an argument, so don't reply with an angry rant, it's just the truth.

&gt; Proper planning would mean they you had a core of young players ready to take up the responsibility when their your stars got old

United actually have one of the youngest squads in the league, especially in defence. Several of United's first team regulars this season could stay at the club for 6-10 years, providing they work out:

Rojo

Jones

Smalling

Before I dive into it, CAKE DAY?! You beautiful bastard. Congrats! 

Financial outlay HAS been good. You're right, but we have to have good financial outlay because our stadium is much smaller than the top 4 clubs that we're looking to compete against. We don't have the type of revenue from our games that United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea do. That outlay helps offset that cost. 

That... helps my point? Yes we just built a training facility and we're about  build a stadium. We can't be at WHL for part of it, so we're renting. That's an additional cost on top of everything else. Renting isn't going to be cheap. There's also the problem if we don't get a facility our size we lose revenue, or we get one too big and the rental price is higher than our ability to pull in fans. 

Levy is no ignorant businessman, he sees all of this. 

That said, I agree we need a competent PL proven striker. I just don't think we're going to get one unless we can shift funds.

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"The two main paths into legal *practice* consist of the Graduate Diploma in Law (aka Law Conversion, aka CPE) followed by either the Legal Practice Course for solicitors or the BPTC for barristers (a total of two years at university post-grad), followed by a traineeship or pupillage of 2 years respectively, before you're an official practicing solicitor/barrister.

As for legal careers, there are paralegals, legal secretaries, legal executives (who are educated in law from experience in another field, but are not qualified lawyers) and notaries. Most of them require some training, and many large London law firms want their paralegals to be legally-trained as well. 

It sounds like the path of a [legal executive specialising in employment law](http://www.cilexlawschool.ac.uk/Prospective_Students/Qualify_as_a_legal_executive/What_is_a_legal_executive) might be for you. You effectively get a solicitor's training, but only in a very specific and narrow area of law. Many people do a few years as a paralegal then study their CILEX qualification to become a chartered legal executive in whatever field they have been working in, and many firms have partners who are legal executives rather than outright solicitors. 

The training for a legal executive consists of the Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice then the Level 6 Qualifications. They are done in modules, with no time limit, to be studied as you like as long as you pay the course fees. They're also taught by distance learning so you don't have to take time off work.

Here's the thing though. If we are a club with the ambition to fight for a Champions League spot there is no option but to sign a competent striker.

I understand the points you are making but sometimes needs must. A striker at the moment wouldn't be a luxury signing it would be a necessary signing and who knows maybe signing Ings would potentially be the difference between Champions League football or not? If that were the case it would be incredible business.

The main is that salaries are higher and/or cost of living is lower in other countries. For example, in Canada, salaries for doctors are roughly twice what the NHS pays, while cost of living is substantially lower.

In Australia, salaries are slightly lower than the NHS (about 80%) in government funded hospitals, but cost of living, especially cost of housing is dramatically lower (in most regions, not necessarily in prime Sydney which is ludicrously expensive). There is also a large private medical sector which pays significantly more. 

The rate of emigration from the UK has been increasing in recent years. This was actually predicted in a major government report in 2002 (the Wanless report 2002). It warned that increasing global mobility would mean that the NHS had to compete for staff with the rest of the world, and if it didn't it, risked being unable to recruit staff due to emigration.

In fact, the Wanless report predicted the current problem with crisis demand, and lack of staffing. It pointed out that rising age of the population, rising healthcare expectations, and rising cost of delivering healthcare, and pointed out that costs would increase dramatically. At the same time, it predicted a shortage of new staff, due to a lack of younger people, or loss of staff to other countries.

&gt; Taking the lowest paid out of income tax entirely was a policy brought uniquely to the table by the Liberal Democrats in 2010…or so the junior coalitionists would have the British public believe.

&gt; The truth is a little more nuanced. My own constituency election address as far back as 2005 asserted an aspiration that no one earning less than £10,000 a year should be caught in the income tax net. After all, £200 a week is scarcely a king’s ransom if you are working in central London. I know several other Tory candidates in the capital and beyond who made similar pledges.

&gt; I should confess that when I sought to repeat this pledge in my 2010 election address, I received a discreet call from CCHQ as we were about to go to press, asking me to rehash the wording. At that time we hoped to expose the Liberal Democrats for having this as an uncosted promise in their manifesto. Four weeks later the coalition had been formed and, hey presto, taking the low paid out of income tax was now firm Coalition Government policy!

The hard part is doing so A) undetected, and B) going in knowing which units you wan't to nick stuff from.

If you don't care about being seen then you simply rent a unit under an alias, use your code to get into the compound, then force open the units you're interested in and pinch the stuff out of them. At the majority of places the individual units aren't alarmed.

Hazard transfer happen, cumulatively this season Chelsea have freed up a significant amount from the wage books and got around £30 million to play with plus whatever money is still available above the FFP threshold which should probably be a fair amount since the team turned a profit this year. Who do you buy and what line up do you play after January using only players who seem immediately available or who have known release clauses (this means no Reus, no Pogba but means players like Koke and Cuadrado are potentially available)? By my estimation there are two positions that need filling to make this work. Either another winger needs to come in to replace Schurrle or another midfielder could be brought in and the team could transition to playing a 4-3-3 in most matches with Oscar moving to the wing. Not sure whether Mourinho would want to switch systems but he does tend to prefer a 4-3-3 in high pressure matches and he might want a defensive revamp after the Spurs fiasco.

It's a tough one and I'm interested in responses. I guess of the players who could be bought out immediately the one that sticks out most is Koke.

I think /u/Digital_Pigeon rather nicely expressed the main reasons for most who could be considered moderate or liberal right. Regarding your edit: it can be a little hard to plot a straight line from least to most right wing. It's sort of trying to quantify the qualitative. But we can more or less all agree what ideologies occupy the farthest reaches of the right. For fascists, national socialists, Ba'athists, ultranationalists, and what have you the idea of martial strength is tied in with their ideas of national character. They also have a tendency to covet their neighbours' countries (to which they of course have a ""historical claim"" or something similar), so a powerful military proves nice and handy for that.

That isn't to say everyone more than a pinch right wing is anything like them, but much of the right shares that attachment to an idealised past version of the nation (if not the crazy garbage about the volk). It is also worth noting that plenty of people buck the trend. The current American right-libertarian breed are all over the place. Compare *Reason*, with many anti-intervention and anti-police-militarisation articles and contributors, to some of the more traditional religious right. Both sides often buck the trend. Bush (43) for instance was hardly a small spender, and it is hard to imagine anyone not considering Ron Paul right wing though his comments on Western intervention sound like an older, creepier Glenn Greenwald. Who is the more right wing? Hard to say.

I agree there is basis for the trend, but it is going to be pretty hard to pin down why. To give it a shot, I'd say that moderate and liberal rightys are motivated by a desire to defend Western liberal values, and to see them spread. For instance they sincerely wanted Iraq to be rid of Hussein and his abominable party, and many of them thought it was the West's duty to do so when the chance came. But as you look toward the fringes that attachment to Western values is replaced in all but name by an attachment to the West generally and/or their nation (let's not even get into those whose attachment is to their race). They don't think the West needs to defend and proliferate it's values, they think the West has to defend *itself*.",null,0,null,1420766999,null,0,1420817552,0,cnj091z,null,t3_2rqv9v,null,t1_cnj091z,null,t3_2rqv9v,null,null,null,1424980331,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

&gt; Terrorism is not tactical thinking it is cowardice.

It actually does play a part in tactical thinking to be honest. Note: ***I am not condoning the tactic***. I read war theory quite a lot, and almost every war tactician has used it at least once, from Sun Tzu and Carl Von Clausewitz, Che Guevara to the current US and UK governments (obviously they sugarcoat it with 'tactical terms' like *Shock and Awe* to convince the public it isn't an abhorrent practice). It plays a part in winning hearts and minds, and it has an affect on economic structure (people are less willing to go out when there's bombs going off left right and centre) depending on the scale it can cripple society as it exists today. I don't think its cowardice either, takes balls to go out and commit a terrorist act - calling it cowardice is a misnomer, depending on the action taken it can range from being morally wrong to unforgivably morally wrong.

I'd be more inclined to say committing a terrorist act with your governments backing is more cowardly than actively fighting *against* the government using the same tactic.

...right...sure...

&gt;Peter Robinson never apologises for loyalist murders and he was totally in a loyalist paramilitary group.


He's a twat too. It's not mutually exclusive. If he had spoken out like this and with a history of actively defending Irish terrorism to the extent Adams has i'd be criticising him too.

&gt;I don't think its cowardice either, takes balls to go out and commit a terrorist act - calling it cowardice is a misnomer, depending on the action taken it can range from being morally wrong to unforgivably morally wrong.

I disagree, I think it is cowardice to plant bombs and shoot innocence to make people scared of you because you are incapable of inspiring or convincing them to join you. I think it is cowardice to threaten the lives of innocents because you are too scared to break into all out war. I think it is and always will be cowardice to kill a child rather than a man.

&gt;I'd be more inclined to say committing a terrorist act with your governments backing is more cowardly than actively fighting against the government using the same tactic.

Does he or does he not apologise though? Of course he will defend the IRA, as almost every republican in the island will, at least to some extent.

&gt; I disagree, I think it is cowardice to plant bombs and shoot innocence to make people scared of you because you are incapable of inspiring or convincing them to join you. I think it is cowardice to threaten the lives of innocents because you are too scared to break into all out war. I think it is and always will be cowardice to kill a child rather than a man.

I think you're misunderstanding the deployment of it, or at least the deployment of it in NI. The shooting of innocents by the IRA (which I find despicable) was done for the most part in response to Loyalist killings of Catholics. Both the Loyalists killings and the IRAs killings of innocents were dissuasion tactics (in the Loyalists case, it was for the most part to stop the IRAs campaign, but partly fueled by hatred of themmuns. In the IRAs case, it was 'revenge' and to dissuade Loyalists of further Catholic killings).

You're correct in saying that planting powerful bombs inspired some hard-line republicans to join the IRA, but that is not the main reason they bombed. Remember, they had a propaganda wing that was responsible for inspiring sympathisers.

I don't think the IRA were afraid of starting an 'all out war' (they were already referring to it as a war during the Troubles) - but in terms of international relations, the IRA was widely supported, while the British government was losing in that regard - so if anyone was afraid of full scale I think it would be them.

I can't think of any case in which a child was specifically targeted by the IRA - perhaps punishment beatings et cetera, but I suppose that was more anti-social teenagers and spides than innocent children. There are however cases in which children were specifically targeted and killed, but I can't think of any instances of the IRA being the perpetrators of such (I will agree with you in this case) cowardice.

As far as addressing goes, looking at the [Royal Mail's own guidelines](http://www.royalmail.com/personal/help-and-support/How-do-I-address-my-mail-correctly) it would normally be something like

It really isn't. And if politicians actually thought that this is some kind of positive thing, then they've really screwed up. It shows amazing incompetence. 

The corp tax rate had very little to do with Ireland's success. The corp residency rules and transfer pricing arrangements were FAR more important than the actual rate itself. Even these though, really were not very important for the bringing in of actual jobs and large scale facilities/factories.

Ireland's competitiveness is based on it's very low tax to GDP ratio, ease of doing business ratings, and it's image abroad. It's also benefiting from the fact that it already has most of the major companies in IT and pharmaceuticals in place.  

As far as i know, the Northern Ireland Government does not have the power to make substantial changes to fiscal areas. This puts it behind the Baltics and other countries which are attempting to become FDI hubs, let alone Ireland.

Why? Because winning is the point of sport? Um... not for real fans of lesser clubs it isn't. How much more rewarding (or ''feeling better'' as you put it) is it for QPR fans when they win a game against a top 4 club? Or win a trophy? Or just do well in general? Just look at how Arsenal/Liverpool fans react when they lose a game. They might ''feel better'' about winning matches (who doesn't) but are they really valuing this sensation? Is it a truly rewarding experience? No - for most of them it's something they take for granted, something they feel they are entitled to when they walk through the turnstiles. Take a look at any comment thread on football articles or listen to the masses that phone into Radio 5 live complaining that they didn't score enough goals in their 1-0 win over Leicester.

Being ""liberal"" on many issues doesn't preclude anyone from exhibiting this basic human trait. Understanding, tolerance, and empathy are difficult things for most people to actually employ in the face of fear. This requires a lot of time spent thinking about issues critically, which is not only time consuming, but difficult. Going with the flow and succumbing to the fear is often the easier alternative, simple as that.

Just a warning before you get too deep with The Troubles, *a lot* in terms of film-making with it has already been done. As such, the local community tends to just sigh at *another* being made - we've saw it all before and that. So it's hard to be original with it.

I think, going into a project like this, it is important to stress the moral ambiguity of The Troubles itself. There is *no* 'good' and 'bad' sides... it was a dirty, dirty conflict - a battle of ideologies (IE left wing vs right wing), between ethnicities (Irish vs British) and sects of Christianity (Catholic vs Protestant).

From the Irish Republican side, notable historical figures are:

* Gerry Adams

* Martin McGuinness

* Bobby Sands

From the British Unionist side, notable historical figures are:

* Ian Paisley

* Peter Robinson

* David Trimble

From a personal perspective, I have quite a speckled history. A family member of mine was an PIRA Volunteer, and was shot to death in a shoot to kill incident while unarmed and driving home. As such, there are a few hardline republicans amongst my closer family (but oddly enough they are not anti-anyone, but have rather transcended insular NI politics and bickering and now wants a fairer world). I also have another family member who was arrested and jailed for a few years for gun running for the PIRA, but he never brings it up so I'm clueless about him for the most part.

Now here's where it gets a bit mad. My uncle was in the *British* Navy (his uncle was the IRA gun runner). Both my uncle and his sister, my aunt are complete fuckin' wingnuts. She made up a story and went to the police, trying to get a prominent (and still very prominent) Republican jailed (my da had a gun put to his head at one point apparently, depending on who you ask (it could be complete bollocks)). She's now in witness protection in some different country with a different name after her attempt failed. 

I have personal memories of witnessing massive riots where guns were shot, memories of watching lorries being hijacked at gunpoint later to be set on fire on the train lines... memories of witnessing a *train* being hijacked and set on fire... memories of seeing balaclava-wearing men walking the streets carrying... oddly large rugs... I've been woken for school in the mornings with a car bomb going off (that killed a human rights lawyer) ...

The thing is... *a lot of people here* have mad families like mine, where near everyone was involved in it in some way.",null,0,null,1420780044,null,0,false,0,cnj74l2,null,t3_2rtdqe,null,t1_cnj74l2,null,t3_2rtdqe,null,null,null,1424977004,null,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5,null

It's better than the old series. We don't have to go back to some of that old formula. Yeah the show was alright back then, but with RTD the show got great. There was a strong mythology and great series arcs with fantastic rewatchability (finding all those hints you missed the first time through, etc). Moffat started great with season 5, but ever since he's been drifting into a more nostalgiac mindset, forgetting so much about what made season 5 and everything before it so great. The first indication of this was when he said he wasn't going to do any more two-parters, which thankfully they changed this season with the finale, but he still seems to be wanting to make the show more procedural overall. Season 8 was better than 7, but he still needs to work harder at getting the show back to its Season 1-5 (and 6 to a lesser extent) glory.

I imagine there's still anti jewish humour out there, it's just not to the same extent in the West as at least in Europe and the US, they're not blowing shit up or cutting heads off as much.

Quite happy to be corrected however, I admit I'm fairly ignorant of Judaism and the jewish conflicts in general.  AFAIK they don't really affect life in the UK that much tho?

The only issue i have is with the ""as long as it doesn't incite hatred"" part. The only reason these pictures have been posted everywhere and so much pressure is being put on the media all of a sudden is because of the recent terrorist attacks. A few terrorists committed horrible atrocities, and instead of targeting insults at them, people retaliated by targeting insults at over a billion people who had nothing to do with it, directly and wrongly associating them with the events and terrorism that happened. In my opinion this is serious enough to consider as inciting hatred, because it's not just the actual insult (yeh it's a picture of Muhammed so what), it's the context of when and how it is delivered.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"Net spend in and of itself is not really indicative of anything as it relates to how much the owners themselves have spent.

Say for example we spent £10M on a player and sold one for £5M.  Does that mean the owners spent £5M of 'their' money?  Not really.

First the sale of a player at £5M doesn't generate £5M in revenue but the £5M minus their current book value minus other fees (like the 5% minimum loyalty bonus, as an example, assuming they didn't put in a transfer request).  So, actual revenue from that £5M player could in fact be negative (if they were sold for less than book value).

For the incoming players, you don't pay £10M, but £10M plus a lot of fees, for example the 5% FA levy on all incoming transfer, probably Agent's Fees, VAT, VAT on Agent's fees, signing on bonuses, relocation assistance, etc, etc.

All of that said, it's irrelevant anyways as those are simply costs or income to the club.  From the club's perspective, there is no difference in paying a player wages or buying BR a new pencil sharpener.  Both are simply expenses against revenue.

What we do know is:

A) FSG bought the club for £300M (most of which was used to cover the £237M debt H&amp;G ran up with RBS).

B) As of the last released fiscal report (for FY 12/13 ending 31 May 2013, which was released March of 2014), Liverpool Football Club owes UKSV (the holding company for FSG) £68.9M.  These funds were provided to the club as non-interest bearing loans and, at least as of back then, the loans had not been converted into shares.

So, at least as of 31 May 2013, FSG has spent £368.9M on Liverpool FC, although again £300M of that is the original purchase price.

Edit:  All of that said, if you're really just interested in club net spend, here's the quick version below (from [here](http://transferleague.co.uk/league-tables/transfer-league-table-last-five-seasons.html)).  At one point a long time back, I had verified that these numbers looked pretty close to accurate, so they should give you an idea.  Basically we spent near as much as United over the past five years gross and net we're behind City, Chelsea, and United but had spent more net and gross than Arsenal.

&gt; Dont reply with an angry rant. It's just the truth.

Absolutely horrid? Finishing 7th? By United's standards, yeah that is horrid. But it's nice to see you admit your rightful place in the table is horrid by United's standards lol. I'd attribute it more to Moyes being shit though. The same team that beat you 3-0 this season were all players available to Moyes last season.

Being successful for 20 years straight affords you luxury of spending your hard earned money. It's funny though. Liverpool have spent roughly the same as United and PL era, and have won fuck all. 13 PL titles built on poor planning lol

&gt; Also, Rojo, Blind, and Shaw were big money buys this summer. Doesn't count as the youth core ready to take over when whiskey nose left. 

You said ""a core of young players ready to take over."" Whether or not they are big signings is irrelevant. Maybe Fergie didn't plan as well for the future as he could have, but LVG certainly is right now. 

&gt; Of the rest of that list, only De Gea is really worth mentioning and he will be gone soon enough. Dont worry.

I'd say Rafael and Jones are worth mentioning. Played a big part in us winning the league in 2013. 

Signs are all positive coming out of the DDG contract situation. Even if he does leave, we'll still have the greatest keeper in Barca's history ready to step in :) Our bloody 3rd choice keeper is now better than your first choice keeper ffs lol

Do you actually owe them the money? If not, you can get the judgment set aside - I believe there's a form to fill and and you basically get the whole thing rerun. Not sure if this requires you never received the judgment, which may be true in your case.

If the judgment stands, the council can now apply for a warrant and send the bailiffs. You should stay in touch with the council and settle how you intend to pay. Having the bailiffs knock sounds unpleasant.

If you feel the judgment is valid enough, but there were other circumstances that make the issue more understandable you can always ask the credit reference agencies to attach a  note to your credit file (it's a legal right you have). Very few loan providers will read it (for smaller loans you are likely to get automatically rejected with a note or CCJ and for large loans, like a mortgage, the big players are likely to do the same - in essence, you a good financial advisor when applying for credit).

null,false,TheJediJew,lfc12,,null,"I think our squad is still suffering from Hicks and Gillett's ownership. We lost a generation of players because of those idiots.

Rafa wasn't allowed to sign the players he wanted in his last two seasons at the club. He regularly bought two distinct player categories - short term buys for now and long term buys for both now and the future. Aquilani, Keane, Jovanovic, Dossena, Benayoun et al fall in the former category while Johnson, Torres, Alonso, Reina, Skrtel, Agger, Lucas, Sterling, et al fall in the latter. Clearly his best signings were those that could play now but still had a long career in front of them.

When his funding got strangled he was forced to pick one of the two. He went for the first - a gamble that went very wrong in retrospect. In the process we lost two years worth of future footballers. 

He was then replaced by Hodgson and the youngest player he bought was Raul Meireles at 27 (and the only good one of the lot). That's another year of future footballer lost.

Kenny, sadly, didn't do much better. FSG were now in charge but definitely still learning the rules of the game. Carroll, Coates and Henderson were his only buys younger than 24.

That's four *years* where we bought a grand total of *one* potential player that turned into a success in Hendo. 

In Brendan's very first competitive squad only 6 of the 16 matchday players (excluding the two he bought himself) were bought in that four year void and only one of them is still here now (Hendo).

Fast forward to now and Rafa's future buys are all in their 30s and over their peak. That 4 year void is hitting us hard right now. We've lost Reina, Agger, Carra, and will lose Johnson and Stevie in the Summer. Lucas is the sole exception at 27 but injuries have crippled the poor lad and robbed him of so much growth.

FSG are now focussed primarily on buying for the future, and that is a good strategy (after all it's exactly what Rafa's success was built on). We will never again be in the situation we are now so long as this methodology continues. The problem is that we *are* in that situation now. We have 8 players who are 27 or older - 3 of them are leaving at the end of the season, one of them is an average reserve goalkeeper. 

That leaves us with Skrtel, Enrique, Lucas and Lambert as our current 27+ players. Two of them are squad players at best and one of them may yet leave as well.

The generation gap is hitting us now, and we need to address it urgently. Lallana (EDIT: and arguably Lovren) is the first purchase we've made in a long time who goes straight into addressing this problem. We need more purchases like him or it will take a good couple of seasons to right our problems.

Having said all of that, we have an extremely talented group of young players who will take us to great heights once they mature. Hendo, Markovic, Can, Sakho, Moreno, Sturridge, Coutinho and Sterling will be a formidable group of players in 5 seasons time when they all approach their peaks (that gives an idea of the time frame we're talking about here).

null,false,the_jacksown,null,null,null,"Final year law student here so hopefully I can be of some help. So you've got a first in Politics, that's definitely a very good start. You have a lot of options in terms of legal careers: paralegal, legal executive, barrister or solicitor. As I only know about the last two options those are the ones I'll tell you about it.

If you want to be a barrister or solicitor in England and Wales you'll have to complete the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) first. This is a short course, it can be up to a year but usually around 9 months, commonly known as the 'conversion course' and it is fairly rigorous. 

Following successful completion of the GDL you'll need to complete the year-long Legal Practice Course (LPC) if you want to become a solicitor. After the LPC comes a two year training contract with a law firm where you work as trainee solicitor before becoming fully qualified. Now, the GDL and the LPC combined get very expensive very quickly, with course fees upwards of £10k for each. The great news is, if you get a training contract before you start the GDL some law firms will pay for your GDL and your LPC. Getting a training contract is, as you might imagine, pretty damn competitive at the big firms, but if you can get one you're set. Otherwise, financing it will be tricky and will probably involve a loan. 

If you want to become a barrister the route is slightly different. You still do the GDL but then you do the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) for one year, followed by one year of pupillage. The BPTC is just as expensive as the LPC and there are about as many pupillages on offer each year in England and Wales as there are training contracts at just the top 5 law firms - so it's unbelievably competitive. Whilst doing the BPTC you must join an Inn of Court, one of the four historic institutions which have the power to officially make people barrister. The four Inns - Grey's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, Middle Temple, and the Inner Temple - each offer between £1m-£1.5m in BPTC and GDL scholarships each year, with applications closing the first Friday in November each year. 

If you then manage to secure a pupillage it's broken into two six month periods or 'sixes'. After your first six you are 'called to the bar', at which point you're officially a barrister. But wait, there's more! At the end of your second six you'll have to apply for tenancy, which is like applying for pupillage all over again. If you get tenancy you finally have a secure job as a barrister. 

Now as you say you think you might be interested in employment law you'd want to target law firms/barristers' chambers where they practise mainly in that area. I'd recommend the search functions on [Chambers](http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk) and [Law Careers](http://www.lawcareers.net) to find out more about firms/chambers. 

Okay I'm rambling now, but if you have any questions just let me know, and feel free to come by and check out the FAQ or post on /r/LLB the sub I mod for law students.

There was a post today in r/soccer about the 10 La Masia products to watch from 2010 and from what I remember almost all were considered potential Barcelona players. Out of the 10, only Thiago and Bartra are Barcelona quality players. Gerry D maybe depending on if he can succeed on his loan at Sevilla. There were hugely hyped players like Jonathan dos Santos, Gai Assulin and Andreu Fontas that might have a place in the mid table side but not for a Champions League quality team. Even for Liverpool, many of us would have thought Suso would have locked a place in the team by now or Robinson would have at least been a back up quality left back for the team. 

We have some talented youngsters in our academy and hopefully they will all turn out to become first team players.

&gt;Mordred readies to kill.
&gt;Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, now retired from teaching (TV: *Mawdryn Undead*) as well as UNIT, is enjoying retirement with his wife Doris. UNIT may still need the gallant old soldier, though; new Brigadier Winifred Bambera and her soldiers, in a nuclear missile convoy near rural Carbury, are faced with inexplicable equipment failure and peculiar sightings of armour-clad knights. In the excitement, the UNIT convoy ignores a pair of hitchhikers nearby: the Seventh Doctor and Ace, lured to Carbury by a distress signal so powerful that it even crosses universes.

Those images didn't make Charlie Hebdo a target, it's just convenient for the likes of the Guardian to pretend that they did.

&gt;defending the right of someone to say whatever they like does not oblige you to repeat their words

Except that is exactly what everyone thinks should be done in response to attacks like this. At the end of Spartacus, you didn't get a field full of people standing up saying, ""I'm Claudius, you shouldn't kill that guy Spartacus who is stood just over there."" If Charlie Hebdo had been attacked by a group of capitalists, offended at Hebdo's stance on corruption, would the Guardian demur from reprinting those cartoons?

&gt;the best response is not to be forced to speak in a different voice

No one's asking them to 'speak' in any voice, just to reprint some drawings. They were happy to show the murder of a police officer on their website, but not the images that they claim caused his death.

&gt;the crudest, most scatological examples

I wonder why they referred to those? Are they arguing from taste and decency now? Some of the Muhamad cartoons are totally benign, a grinning middle eastern charicature with a big smile on its face.

&gt;terrorists’ chief goal is to make us change our behaviour

And by cowtowing to their murderous censorship, you've done exactly that. I guarantee you that if you were to go through copies of the Guardian from pre2000, you will find depictions of Muhamad in some form or other. The only reason they're not even willing to print a stick figure with the caption of 'Muhamad standing still doing nothing offensive' is because they're cowards, scared of their own shadow, scared of offending people eager to be offended, scared of standing up for their own rights and principles.

In international discussions of economic policy, the British government likes to boast of the flexibility of its economy. In some areas, notably the labour market, the UK does have a relatively unregulated economy. But every country has its sacred cows, and Britain’s is housing. In planning, the UK persists with an approach that might be described as Stalinist. The difference is that, whereas Stalin wanted to make things happen, the UK’s land-use system is designed to do the opposite. It is spectacularly successful. If it had been in effect in the 19th century, none of the great British cities would now exist.


Here are two simple indicators. First, the number of houses constructed in the UK in the financial year 2012-13 was the lowest since the second world war, at just 136,000. Even in 2013-14, just 141,000 houses were built. In 1969-70, the corresponding figure was 378,000. This is a stunning collapse.

Second, this decline in output has not been due to any diminution of demand. This is demonstrated by prices. According to Nationwide Building Society, the ratio of house prices to average full-time earnings rose from a trough of 2.1 in 1995 to an all-time peak of 5.4 in 2007. It fell to 4.1 in the first quarter of 2009, still high by historical standards, before rising to 5.0 in 2014.


Collapsing supply and soaring prices: nothing could better indicate severe constraints on supply. Those who do not know better will say that supply is constrained because building land is limited in a small and densely populated island. This is true, but not for physical reasons. Only 11 per cent of England’s surface area is urbanised. The urban-dwelling majority do not recognise this because they travel so much more slowly inside towns than between them. The restrictions on land availability are man-made. They are due to a control system of baroque complexity that has not only constrained supply, but, far worse, has created a set of powerful vested interests in its continuation. Among those interests are local residents, homeowners in general and the banks that finance them. In a genteel British way, this is a corrupt arrangement whose result is to benefit the haves at the expense of have-nots. It is supported by pressure groups, such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, which I think of rather as the Campaign to Contain Urban England.


One of the ironies is that the inability to build houses probably prevented a far worse economic crisis in the UK, since it prevented an expansion of supply and subsequent collapse in prices like those seen in Ireland, Spain or the US. But the long-run social and economic consequences are dire. These include massive transfers of resources across generations — and, within generations, to people whose parents own properties — which is arguably more important. They also undermine the ability of young people to afford housing and to form families.
Defenders of the system tend to refer to housing wealth as the product of savings. It is not

Moreover, the wealth accumulated by property owners is fundamentally unproductive. Defenders of the system tend to refer to this wealth as the product of savings. It is not. I understand this myself, since I own a house whose nominal value is perhaps 25 times as great as it was when I bought it 30 years ago, almost nine times higher after adjusting for inflation. This vast increase in wealth is not due to my endeavours. It is overwhelmingly the product of a rise in the value of land, which is the fruit of other people’s efforts, not mine.


Change will come only once people recognise how unjust this situation has become. This is not just about obstacles to becoming an owner occupier. High house prices will also raise rents. They will ultimately force people to live in more cramped conditions than would occur without limits on supply.


What is to be done? If a solution were politically easy, it would already have happened. It is not. I cannot think of a better example of the way in which controls tend to create a vested interest in their perpetuation.


The obstacles to moving to a more supply-friendly set of policies are huge. But the long-run consequences of continued population growth alongside such low rates of new building are likely to prove explosive.


The long-term aim should be to reform the incentives facing local authorities, the role of prices in land-use planning, property taxation and housing finance. Here is a set of challenges worthy of a reforming government. In the short run, given extremely low long-term interest rates and the high value of houses, government could either build more or subsidise building. In 1969-70, local authorities built 185,000 dwellings. Without going that far, governments could do far more.

I'm a big fan of Gaiman having picked up his books this year after reading [Ocean At The End of The Lane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane).

Books I read this year.

[Game of Thrones - George RR Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones)
Everyone knows GOT by now, I really enjoyed the books, I had already watched the TV Series so this flashed that out a bit.

[The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets - Simon Singh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17287021-the-simpsons-and-their-mathematical-secrets) - A popular maths book, great and fun introduction to some mathematical concepts with how they have been sneaked into The Simpsons by those smarty writers.

[The Ocean at The End of The Lane - Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane) - My first Gaimann book, a lovely and warming story that he actually started writing as a short story for his wife, but it became a full blown novel. 

[Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship and Betrayal - Nick Bilton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656827-hatching-twitter) - Interesting story about the start of twitter and the politics, I don't know how true all the story actually is, but he does defintely portray goodies and badies in the story. Worth a read if you're interested in business start ups.

[A Clash of Kings - George RR Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10572.A_Clash_of_Kings)

[Twelve Yards - Ben Lyttleton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18395011-twelve-yards) - Just before the World Cup I got this book for my birthday, all about penalties. Does give a good insight into penalty taking and give an idea of some techniques. I do now find myself, with great accuracy guessing when someone is going to miss a penalty. Interesting in the book that one of the academics picks out a few players from the Dutch side that he wouldn't want to see take a penalty. Both missed in the WC.

[American Gods - Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4407.American_Gods) - A dark tale of the fight to survive amongst old gods and new. Steeped in hidden mythology. But basically a good story. Many think it is Gaimanns best work.

[The Rosie Project - Graeme Simsion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16181775-the-rosie-project) - A great story, not the height of liteary quality. But simply a lovely story about a Professor who has a routine to everything, devises a questionnaire in order to find his perfect wife. Gets mixed up with a woman who doesn't meet any of the criteria but she turns his world upside down. Great characters and a lovely story, one of the books I just couldn't put down. 

Currently Reading[ A History of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything). 

8 books read in one year is a big achievement for me, I have only just got into book reading. I believe I never had the patience to sit around and read. But short blocks on the train journeys help. Before now I was always just a short article reader. I am aiming for 10 books this year.

When people cry, oh boo hoo, you're offended, what a shame, it's usually in response to someone calling them out on being an out and out nasty racist fuck.

In regards to the cartoons, I would say that there isn't an issue in printing them, many Muslims here on reddit have said that of course they are offended by having their religious figure depicted in such a way, but it's the right of the person who drew it to do so, so they just ignore it and move on.  However I completely understand the argument that allows the curtailment of anything that is deliberately meant to undermine any demographic, whether it be race, sexual, gender, faith etc because it can lead to, or aid in the complete marginalisation and dehumanisation of that demographic. Which is why I believe, laws exist that prevent racial abuse for example. If you allow people to to throw racist abuse around and they go unchallenged, it's not long before that escalates to direct harassment, maybe online, then in person, and soon it becomes physical.

In any case, I don't think him choosing a low quality, but factually correct, analogy, is a reason to force him to apologise.

Also: The essence of the Ched Evans case isn't about the definition of rape, but whether he raped or not.  This is one court case involving one individual defendant, not a case of writing or rewriting the law.  Both the crown and ched Evans are working on the basis of the law as it is.  The crown says he raped according to the current law.  He says he didn't, according to the current law.  It's unhelpful in terms of discussing this particular case to wrongly claim it's about what the law should be, or what the definition of rape is, as neither of these are at issue in the court case.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf

From the awards and recognition section:

Wolf was joint winner of the Wincott Foundation senior prize for excellence in financial journalism in both 1989 and 1997. He won the RTZ David Watt memorial prize in 1994. In 2000. Wolf was awarded the CBE (Commander of the British Empire). He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, by the University of Nottingham in 2006, and was made Doctor of Science (Economics) of University of London, honoris causa, by the London School of Economics in the same year.

Wolf is a regular participant in the annual Bilderberg meetings of politicians and bankers. He is visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, a Special Professor at the University of Nottingham and an honorary fellow of the Oxford Institute for Economic Policy. He has been a forum fellow at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos since 1999.[5] Wolf has been named in the top 100 lists of global thinkers by Prospect[6] and by Foreign Policy magazine.[7]

Wolf is regarded as ""staggeringly well connected"" within elite financial circles.[1] His friends include leading financiers such as Mohamed A. El-Erian; politicians such as Manmohan Singh, Timothy Geithner and Ed Balls; many leading economists; central bankers such as Mervyn King: according to Wolf, he knows all significant central bankers.[1] Despite Wolf's close connections with the powerful, he is trusted for his independence and is known to criticise initiatives promoted by his friends when he considers it to be in the public's interests.[1] Wolf is widely regarded as one of the most influential economics journalists in the world. Lawrence H. Summers has called him ""the world's preeminent financial journalist""[8] Mohamed A.

null,false,pesty91,null,null,null,"Ok so basically, I have now done a fair bit of research now, and in case you're interested: The data protection act states that everybody has a right to request all  information which is held about them. This also applies to police records. A subject access request can be performed, at a cost of £10 which commands the police to give you every bit of info they hold on you, this can be convictions that you know about, warnings etc. but also includes notes that officers have made about you, which you may not already know about. I have already done a subject access request but it does little to tell me whether or not my warning will appear on an enhanced DBS, unfortunately.    

It's pretty clear from the official .gov website that a person can't do DBS checks on themselves, enhanced or otherwise. Only an organisation can perform a DBS check. The organisation must either be registered with the DBS, which costs £300 or go through an umbrella organisation, who will have their own fees attached. A DBS check can only be performed for a particular position if it meets certain criteria, i.e. included in either the ROA 1974 for a standard DBS, or the ROA and Police Act 1997 for an enhanced, [source](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/349126/DBS_guide_to_eligibility_v6.pdf). The person who is being checked must also be offered the job on condition only of the results from the DBS. 

The reason I bothered to look all of this up is because my old man is a small business owner, so I was wondering if he can do the DBS on me. Pretty sure any position that he could potentially offer wouldn't fit into either of the bits of legislation, however, I think that this only becomes an issue when the candidate being checked raises it, so i may still get away with it. In any case it would certainly look rather fishy with the DBS if a father is carrying out an enhanced DBS on his son...

You won't be able to speak the truth to power if we accept carve outs for whatever isn't politically correct, unless you assume that what is offensive at one point in time can never be the truth.

What is offensive to the mainstream has historically *often* been the truth. E.g. the idea that black people deserved equal treatment was long seen as offensive.

And criticising various uses of religion to oppress has many places throughout history been seen as blasphemy.

And many things we see as harmless, others see, or have seen as deeply offensive and ""misuse of free speech"".

To give an example of what your line of thinking can lead to: In Norway, when Monthy Python's Life of Brian was released, it was seen as a misuse of free speech on the basis of similar arguments to the one you are putting forth: It wasn't ""worthy"" of free speech protections, because it didn't serve a political purpose, so it was ok to ban it under anti-blasphemy legislation because it was considered a misuse of free speech to offend christians (it was the last ever use of that law).

Clearly what is offensive is fluid. But a lot of that fluidity is contingent on people being able to say unpopular things so that unpopular viewpoints can also get heard, and possibly gain popularity (Yes, that means vile viewpoints may also gain popularity; but what you and I find vile may very well be in conflict)

Protecting even *just* (and I would argue this is just a small part of what freedom of speech is about) the ability to ""speak the truth to power"" thus requires being vigilant about protecting speech that we find offensive *first and foremost* for the simple reason that speech that those in power don't find offensive is much less at risk of getting attacked by the state in the first place.

Because:
We did a loan deal where Milan paid his whole salary of 175k/week for two years. If we did not release Torres Milan would be stuck with a failed Torres and 175k/week for 18 months. 
Now we transfered Torres to Milan so they could loan him to Atletico. They still got to pay his 175k salary but instead they get Cerci (or whatever he's called) who is a proven Serie A player. Same cost but a potentially better player, which would make it worth for Milan to pay a million or two.

&gt; The closer a game is, the more injury time is played. That's understandable - how many times have we seen referees ending thrashings just a second or two early, perhaps to protect the dignity of the losing team, or simply because everyone's lost interest. But there appears to be a significant bias towards big clubs when the game is still in the balance. If you're playing at one of the big clubs and you're two goals down, you get an average of 3 minutes and 45 seconds to claw back the deficit. If you're two goals up, the big club gets more than five minutes to try and break you down.

He doesn't even consider the idea that when a 'smaller' team is winning they will be far more likely to burn game time at every tumble and dead ball, thus creating more extra time. The concept that the 'small' clubs might have anything to do with the statistical discrepancies is conveniently absent. Confirmation bias at its best.

TV romanticises LFC; passionate working-class fans, a team steeped in history and tradition, etc. We have a great fanbase abroad who unfortunately only ever see LFC through this idealistic and narrow vision being screened on their TV's. Some visit the city and the stadium, but even more can't and some never will. What it misses out is what it's like to live in Liverpool itself. Like many on here, I'm a native of the Merseyside area and can safely say I'd rather live in London than here. I could tolerate Manchester for £200k a week. 

Liverpool is neither a big or a particularly 'great' city, and like the club it's heyday was in the past. It was brought to its knees in the 70s/80s by the government and, around the outskirts of the city, still bears the scars of numerous failed regeneration projects. Toxteth, which is 3.7 miles away from Anfield, looks like something out of a war zone rather than part of a city you'd want to live in.

That doesn't give me a right to say I'm more informed or better in some way, but it does mean I can understand where our failed and prospective transfer targets are coming from.  I feel like a large part of the circlejerks (Reus, Sanchez, Benezema, Isco, Valdes, etc) that take place on here are a result of fans who, because they don't have this first-hand experience, can't put 2 + 2 together. In their minds we're a big club, so why can't we sign big players? It's perfectly reasonable to them to use the Suarez cash to go out and just buy Karim Benzema from Real Madrid.

On 10 August 1991 a 33 year-old shopkeeper was shot dead in his shop on the Falls Road, Belfast. This was followed by the shooting dead of a 66 year-old shopkeeper on James's Road, Belfast in October. Both were targeted for selling An Phoblacht in their newsagents.[7][8] On 12 December 1992 AP/RN worker Malachy Carey was shot dead by loyalist gunmen in Ballymoney. In January 1991 the RUC also raided the offices of An Phoblacht in Belfast seizing computer equipment and disks.[9] Letter bombs were also frequently sent to An Phoblacht by loyalist paramilitaries in the 1990s. In one incident on 4 January 1994 a bomb disguised as a book was carried outside of the offices by AP/RN book reviewer Aengus Ó Snodaigh where it exploded a short time later, injuring two members of the Irish Defence Forces bomb disposal unit as they attempted to defuse it.[10]^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Phoblacht#Attacks_by_loyalist_paramilitaries)",null,0,null,1420802670,null,0,false,0,cnjdlji,null,t3_2rsow8,null,t1_cnjdlji,null,t1_cnjcmm5,null,null,null,1424973947,null,7,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,7,null

You'd be amazed at what some of the catering industry does and gets away with if you've not worked in it. 

I have worked for a 'restaurant' where the boss once asked me to clock out while it was quite and he'd call me back in when it picked up. He knew damn well it would take me close to 2 hours to get home that day and that he'd need help again in the evening. Luckily I was in a position where I neither gave a shit about keeping that job nor did I really need the money. So I told him that he either keeps me on and pays me until the end of the shit as we agreed 2 weeks before, or I go home and he wont be able to call me back in. Like I said, I was in a position where the job wasn't of great importance, but I can imagine how difficult that situation would be for someone who needed the hours to get by and I can't see much of an option other than sitting around until the boss wanted you back.

Like I said, I didn't need the job and I was more than willing to lose the job standing up for my self. The man I worked for was by far the worst person I've ever come across, he once called me a stupid cunt in front of customers because I made him a latte when he wanted a cup of tea, despite giving me a written order with latte on it. The chef in the place had no option but to put up with the managers bullshit because he had to provide for his young lad, the boss would often come in drunk and verbally (once or twice physically) abuse the chef, and he never dared to speak up. Absolutely horrible situation. 

Another place I have worked would occasionally close early because it wasn't busy and the boss of that place was an absolutely brilliant bloke. He'd ask all of the stuff quietly and individually if they minded leaving early.

This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYCFC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone.

I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible.

The outgoing Chancellor leaving a note on the desk for Osborne saying ""Sorry, the money's all gone - best of luck"" would be funny if it weren't true.

I know small business owners who were forced out of business as a direct result of Labour policies, and lets not forget the heavy erosion in civil liberties that was ushered in under the ""something must be done"" mantra of Anti-Terror Laws, etc.

Anyone who was in a Blair/Brown Cabinet already has my contempt, and I simply can't afford Milliband the credibility he would need for me to vote for his party. That's not to say I will never vote Labour, but not in their current incarnation.

UKIP no, Lib Dems no. Maybe a few years back, but not this time.

That really leaves the Conservatives. And they have their shortcomings, as do all the parties, but I honestly do see them as the least-bad option in terms of economy, business, etc, etc.

And also, perhaps most importantly, I trust my Tory MP to represent me. He replies to emails, occasionally rebels when there's a vote on a topic that would adversely affect our constituency. He stand sup for his constituents.

A far cry from the vapid Labour MP he replaced (one of ""Blair's Babes"") who never rebelled against the party. I once tried to have a discussion with her on something and all she contributed was ""well, I completely agree with the government's line on this"".

Every single fucking point - ""Oh, well I agree with the PM/Party/Cabinet.""

Great, then *what are you for* if you just blindly do whatever the party who tells you to? You may be a Labour MP, but you are also entitled to an opinion of your own. You're supposed to be representing your constituents - who almost certainly have different views to those of Blair and Brown's constituents.

Sounds like you may have the papulopustular subtype? Have you previously been prescribed any topicals such as 15% azelaic acid? I find it excellent for the papules and pustules - confined to my nose - tho it is too drying for my cheeks. I just started using 4% niacinamide for the cheeks (I have previously used 2% and 4% in cosmetic products). Both AzA and niacinamide should also be useful in the sun damage aspect of anti ageing.

As you research ask your GP for what you want. Niacinamide is licensed for acne vulgaris not rosacea but I pointed out there are a couple of studies in rosacea and he (somewhat reluctantly!) wrote a script. If your rosacea does not respond to anything your GP prescribes ask to be referred to a hospital dermatologist. If your GP is really rubbish you have the right to ask for another doctor in the same practice or switch practices entirely.

You don't mention a broad spectrum sunscreen, that is considered a key part of self care in rosacea and also important in anti ageing. Be sure you are eating enough oily fish for bioavailable vitamin D and anti inflammatory long chain omega-3s: this is especially important in winter and when using sunscreen.

Corporations and liquidation massively abused to get out of things like fines, taxes and debts.

One of the biggest scams is the strike of scam. 

Essentially you go Ltd submit your first annual year return and corporation tax and accounts. Then you simply do not respond to anything HMRC or companies house send to you.

As a result companies house strikes off your company. From that moment the Ltd company ceases to exist. All debts, fines taxes and penalties cannot be held against an entity which no longer exists. The previous directors then open up a new Ltd company which is a completely different entity to the old one in the eyes of companies house. It may do the same job it may have the same directors the same location and the same business area.

But in the eyes of the law it is a completely new entity.

A few of my clients were scammed like that. They did some work / supplied goods to a ltd company. They always paid on time. Then one time they ask for a few days credit. They take the goods then hollow out the company of assets. Then liquidate.

They then open up a new company with those goods.

I don't know.

I guess the thing I'm thinking is why arn't there more planning applications? - I'd hazard a guess that increasing land prices are to blame - there is no incentive to invest, build and sell it on if the land will just continue to increase in value without doing anything.

That's what all private companies do. They hand it over to receivers who sell the assets and property at face value (or probably less). To expect anything else from a private company isn't realistic.

However, the NHS might be able to buy it back at a massively reduced price now, with the investments they made (which were significant) and get it back on form under ""normal NHS management"".

Also at least we have a stark comparison to draw against public and private run healthcare now as well.

Edit: technically they could have sold a turd to a private company with a budget with promised investment, capitalised on the investment, then squeezed the budget until the holding company goes red, then buy it back at a reduced price. So technically the NHS may have profited from this and retain the capacity and assets.

I don't care like Jose what Frank says, does, scores, shits whatever. He is now a Manchester City player. Regardless of how he got there, he is there and that is that.

Being a Chelsea fan, I want us to win the league. Being a Manchester City player Frank wants Man City to win the league.

Its that simple, otherwise he wouldn't have played or scored against us.

Its really a sense now of rivalry. Legend or not, he is now the enemy. He is playing in direct competition with our aims and ambitions. He could have easily gone back to MLS or frankly signed for another MLS team. 

He chose that team knowing he'd be back in the Premier League. 

And honestly I really don't give a shit and am sick of people bringing this up. We have one of the best midfielders in the world in Fabregas, and with his history with Lamps, there was no way they were going to be in the same squad.

Now the absolute joke would be Frank to be there NEXT season, making this post of his complete horseshit too.

I'm happy with my club letting him go, and bringing him Fabregas. He can score all he wants and take it up the arse from Toure for all I care. Even if they finish top with him helping, I don't care. I support Chelsea and thats that. No remorse, no ""he should have stayed"" as Fabregas in his prime beats an old aged Lampard, even if he is scoring. Plus he wasn't so good for us last season anyway.

Which in some ways answers your second question there aren't that many planning applications because costs are very high which makes the risks very high.

The answer to me is to de-regulate and reduce the costs of the planning process. And re-imburse those who's applications fail.

We recently had to go through the approval process to build a solar farm and it is ridiculous the hoops you jump through. Note I work for a hedge fund and an arbitrage of doing an application and then selling the application exists because of how tight regulations are. Building a small solar park is not even close to the amount of regulation you'd need to jump through to build a house. If anyone from the surrounding area had complained to council about the park (it was tiny, a couple of acres on a rural farm) then it would have held the entire process up by about 6 months.

Dear Nick Raynsford,

I hope you agreed with Nick Clegg when he said that ""People have to be
free to offend each other"" and with that in mind I hope you can push to
change Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Section 4A inserted
into the Public Order Act 1986 which states

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person
harassment, alarm or distress, he— (a) uses threatening, abusive or
insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays
any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening,
abusive or insulting, thereby causing that or another person
harassment, alarm or distress.

In accordance with this statue a Glasgow man was arrested for making
off colour jokes on twitter
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-30585301  and many others
have been investigated for similar comments made in bad taste.

I certainly agree that it should be a crime to threaten or harass but I
draw the line at simple insults and probably abuse too.

They are hypocrites. Most are of the elite political class with millions in the bank and have never held a real job. At least the Conservatives don't pretend they're normal people. 

I remember seeing Ed Milliband making a ""speech"" in the centre of town on a scruffy wooden pallet. Of course he was surrounded by advisers and guards and personal army I reporters and cameras to show everybody how working class Ed is! 

Do you remember that Emily Thornburry twitter incident? I think that brings home my point more than anything. An experienced MP representing the working class baffled as to why anybody would fly the Saint George's flag. Just completely disconnected from real people.

null,false,70_S_Dancer,knight,Dragon Knight,null,"I used to play support alch quite a bit, this is a few patches ago but still relevant:

Play pos 4, this makes use of his greevils greed to allow fast support items and transformation late game.
Get tangos, clarity, and either wards and iron branches or all iron branches at the start. No salve. This will give you a headstart on stats and speed up wand building.
You shouldnt take enough damage to need a salve.

Depending on what your carry needs get stun or acid first. The acid can be used to phase out an offlaner early game as it does quite alot vs low levels or low hp heroes. Stun obviously can be used when your carry wants to be aggressive and kill, but i generally prefer acid then stun. 

Level 3 should always be greed unless you are going ham on the enemy heroes. This allows you to farm and tbh you should try to stack every opportunity. Use your acid to help farm easy and hard camp on dire or easy and mid camp radiant. 

Level 4&amp;5 i usually get lvl 2 greed and 2 in acid.

After your inv has a tp/ brown boots/wand go for i would say arcanes, but if you are having no trouble with mana then build for mek.

By that time you should have 6 and you can just use your ult to regen mana slowly. Arcanes are still good to increase mana pool and for the rest of the team though. Generally i ask 5 to buy wards but it is always more important to have good vision, so i sacrifice early items for this. You should have mek before the other team though, otherwise you have not used greevils greed well. 

Generally i then build for drums. Bracer helps with tank and damage, then drums helping my poor attack speed and move speed. You should activate drums when you channel your stun to prevent self stunning because your target gets away. You should try to divert enemy dps your way instead of your carry's.

Level 7 to 11 i get as many points in stun as i can and get to 3 in greevils. This makes sure i keep up in farm as i can now jungle with ulty which i also pick up at 11. You should be buying wards as much as your 5 now as your mid game items are online.

At this point you have three options imo. Build blink for positioning problems, if your team is snowballing this can keep the pace up and catch the more cautious out. Pipe if your team is suffering magical damage as it is good hp regen and magic resist for you. If its dps then get a crimson guard. Your ult combined with pipe or crimson guard or just the vanguard will allow you to absorb alot of damage. To be honest building all three would be uhh okay if you wanted to go super util. Blademail is also okay but unless you are the preferred target/tank it may be money wasted.

However once my drums become obselete i usually think about AC. This starts your transitition to carry while still giving bonuses to your weaknesses and your team.

You can leave acid spray till late game if you wish in terms of levels after level 2. Its minus armour will help you more but mid game the stun and tank ability from ignoring acid spray levels is super good.

1) MPP is quite a novelty in the UK and Europe still, I understand it is far more established in the US. The Blatvonik School is so new, that it is for now operating on the prestige assumption that 'it's at Oxford, so it must be good'. Tuition is pricey, and I have heard faculty staff be exceptionally critical as to the academic/career-worth of the programme. I have heard it referred to as 'the mother of all cash-cows'.

2) Check out the major US scholarships, the Oxford website has a good funding tool [you should check out.](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search) Although the short answer is 'not very likely' especially as you are competing some of the most stellar applicants the world has to offer.

3) I've loved my experience so far in general, but I'm not at that department!

4) By schools I am assuming you mean colleges (which aren't just 'dorms' ala houses in Yale). Depends what you want, if you want an old and mixed college (mixed meaning they also teach undegrads) then they are quite competitive, but worth it. If you are aiming for St. John's, Magdalen, Balliol, Christchurch and the like I suggest you readjust your sights as by this late stage in the application process (for 2015 entry) you will end up disappointed.  Postgraduate-only colleges are a mixed bag, but I've been to Green Templeton College plenty of times and it is very nice indeed, so would say that is probably the best of that bunch.

Players in London will experience the same, unless you think London is paved with gold in every part? Many Liverpool players IIRC have homes in the Cheshire countryside, which is one of the most beautiful parts of the country, and commuting into Liverpool from the surrounding countryside is a lot easier than in London. 

Tbh the argument holds water when you're talking about what London has to offer in terms of culture, entertainment, cuisine, and almost every other aspect of lifestyle indulgence. Not that Liverpool doesn't offer this stuff, but it can't hold a candle to the sheer breadth and depth of London. This may be important to some people, not so much to others. It also depends on the player's wives and families as to whether this is an important consideration, as was reportedly the case with Sanchez.

MD From UK Gaming Computers here. One of our past customers saw this and kindly pointed in our direction. 

I cant see any specifics on your order as it will be impossible to pin point with only a order value but we would have absolutely no reason to lie about finding a fault or not. If there is a hardware fault with a PC then we simply replace said component(s) - after all we are covered by a manufacturers warranty on the component so it doesn't cost us anything. If we concluded that there was no fault then there would be no hardware fault. Ravuz has commented on how he/she sees our returns service. 

Crashes and blue screens are nearly all of the time due to a software issue and I suspect this was probably what you were told at the time of your return, and that software issues are not supported by us. 

Did you contact us after you got the PC back form return? Did you investigate to see if the issue was software related?

I would also be very interested in to know how you were threatened? PM me if reddit has the feature. This is something I do not condone at my company so would like to find out specifics about this whole issue.

My advise would be to take it to a local computer shop - let them repeat the diagnosis. I strongly suspect it will be software related, £50 later and they would have solved your problem and you would be able to sell the system working for 4 times that price or use it. Hell, I would give you twice your price now and send a courier to collect it! 

Apologies if this message seems a little forward but someone suggesting that UKGC could be potentially lying about a return is something I take seriously especially if its because a PC has a software fault.

Chelsea tried to sign him in 2003 for even more than we paid 4 years later! The only reason he hadn't ""done it before at a top team"" was because he wasn't at a top team; he stuck around at Atletico past the point at which most players would because it was his boyhood team, and unfortunately at the time the rest of their squad wasn't good enough to offer him top-drawer club football in the CL and the like. You could make parallels with Rooney, Everton and United I guess.

Personal experience, yo. Type 2 describes a guy who punched me in the face when I was 10 and is now in prison on terrorist offences.

Of course, when the troubles started you had people who in any other circumstances would have gone on to live crime-free, blameless lives but were pushed into terrorism through the action or inaction of a state prejudiced against them. But as it went on, and especially after the peace process, those who are still fighting fit the descriptions above. 

They weren't born assholes or idiots, and if they'd had better parenting or more effective interventions from school, extended family or social services they wouldn't have ended up wanting to or being manipulated into murdering for 'the cause'.

As for how it felt day-to-day (and how it still feels when I go home to ye olde Murder Triangle), there is no comparison.

Soldiers used to walk about town all day every day with huge rifles. You'd be driving home down an old country lane and see hazard lights ahead not knowing if it was an army checkpoint, if it was the 'RA, if it was the UVF or god knows who else. You had to go through security checkpoints driving into the airport and then scan all your luggage as soon as you got in the door. There were barriers up to shut off many major town centres after 7 o'clock at night. There's still no public lockers for luggage in bus or train depots because bombs would be left in them. You had to learn that if you saw an unattended bag to get the hell out of there as soon as possible. You didn't go out for anything but milk and teabags after a bombing/shooting in case there was a retaliatory attack on your community. Whenever we went to Belfast to shop we had to agree a safe place to find each other in case there was a security alert. You couldn't split off in different directions. In the 70s when my Mum was studying in Belfast, you got a taxi from the train station to student halls, as walking the mile between them could get you shot. You went to Uni, the SU bar, halls and nowhere else.

Oh, and you don't call the police (if you're on the Nationalist side of the community) for anything, or ever be seen contacting the police lest you get a knock on your door one night.

If you put water soluble paint on someone's window that washes off in the rain, the police wont get you in trouble for criminal damage, because it costs nothing for the ""victim"" to clean it up, just as with bacon on a door handle. 

If someone put a pocket full of sand (shout-out to /r/pocketsand ) through your car window, then there should be maybe a verbal warning for anti-social behaviour, because there's no damage done apart from maybe 45 seconds of your time to hoover it up. If someone *filled* your car with sand, then that would probably be criminal damage for which more than a verbal caution should be handed out because it's actually costly to you.

I agree there should be some retribution for the bacon folk, at *very* least a verbal caution. But the fact that it was done particularly to target Muslims, knowing that they would be particularly offended should mean they get at least a little more than a verbal caution, because it's effectively discrimination or a ""hate crime"" - targeted harassment almost.

Everything these gunmen did in Paris was sanctioned by Islam. Not by fringe Islam. Or some extremist interpretation of Islam. But by the core tenets of the faith. The tenets taught to every man, woman and child in the Islamic world.

And unlike Christianity - where stoning people to death can be ignored as archaic - Islam specifically prohibits reinterpretations of the faith. It is the last word of God, not the first. There will be no change.

We need to start talking about Islam honestly. And while it is true to say not all Muslims are radical maniacs, it's not accurate to say that Islam is just as varied and diverse as other religions, especially Christianity. It's far worse and more at odds with modern society.

null,false,technicalthrowaway,null,null,null,"&gt; Is the fact it wasn't causing physical harm really relevant?

Yes. Because if we start sending people to prison simply because they ""hurt someone's feelings once"" then pretty much everyone on Reddit should be in prison.

I don't think putting bacon on a door handle is threatening or intimidating.

Had they said something, or left a note, or a threat, then that would be intimidation and threatening, or if they'd done it over and over again, that would be harassment, or if they were trying to get others to attack them, that would be inciting violence etc. But none of those things happened.

&gt; Surely it doesn't seem OK to put a sign with a swastika outside a synagogue or a burning cross outside the house of a black family?

No it's not, because they are both threatening symbol associated with violence and hatred towards a certain group of people. Bacon is bacon - not a symbol of hatred or violence. One Muslim redditor once described how Muslims view pigs as how anyone else might view a sewer rat: a dirty horrible little creature. Not a sign of death or violence like a burning cross or swastika.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending the people who put the bacon there - they're clearly unpleasant and hate-filled individuals - but I think a prison sentence was far too harsh in that case. Even just from the pragmatic point of view: as tax payers, we're now all paying for them to be in prison, and they're not going to be able to provide back to the community, whereas had they been given a community order, it'd be the opposite way round. Also, chances are they'll be even more bitter and hate filled when they come out, whereas had they been made to work in or alongside the Muslim community, they might actually change their views on Muslims.

There's a really good reason why nobody does it this way. You literally don't skill stun until 7, that's really bad, you're still a support. Just because you can farm constantly doesn't mean you should, stuns and CC are very important for supports.

The committee is absolute wank right now and they're completely fucked up 3 consecutive and very important transfer windows.  People like to scream about BR getting it all wrong, but it's not entirely up to him.  He's clearly had some players forced on him and he's not happy with that.  He's not gotten the players he feels he needs in to play the football he wants to play, so he's trying to cram what we do have into a system that doesn't suit most of them.  He's being stubborn about that rather than looking to adapt himself and his system to the resources at his disposal, but IMO the problem starts before he even begins to set the team up.

When there are too many moving parts, too many opinions, things are spread out and can become very disjointed.  I think the transfer committee is a prime example of over-complicating a task that's much better left to a more consolidated team/person.  If a transfer comes down to BR and the DoF discussing a player (with the DoF having the final say) it's far easier for Rodgers to get the right players than if there are 5 people (including Rodgers) voting on a player.  If the DoF is the proper personality then he'll also have much better access to the proper players and their people, so we can adjust our targets a fair bit and probably stand a better chance to get in top players (marginally better I bet, but it's something).",null,0,null,1420811132,null,0,false,0,cnjftt8,null,t3_2rt94v,null,t1_cnjftt8,null,t1_cnjdmcx,null,null,null,1424972836,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

So I would give Man City a choice: 1) they are awarded a 0-3 loss for every game that Lampard played in (includes FA Cup so Sheffield Wednesday reinstatated) or 2) they have to pay a fine of a year’s worth of Lampard’s £190,000 per week salary. This would almost certainly make them fall foul of FFP again, and since they illegally tried to circumvent their FFP imposed wage freeze, this only seems fair. I imagine the repeat offender FFP punishment from UEFA would be crazy huge, given that the first time offence punishment was a €60m fine, squad restrictions and a wage freeze.

So City pick their poison: either they get deducted a huge amount of points (all the points they won with Lampard playing) or they have to pay unbelievably huge fines and probably get chucked out of the Champions League. Alternatively, if they pick the second option, they could theoretically sell some of their highest earners in January (Aguero, Kompany etc) so that they don’t fall foul of their wage restrictions.

Whatever they choose, they’d be screwed.""

&gt;Sands died on 5 May 1981 in Maze prison hospital after 66 days of hunger-striking, aged 27.[29] The original pathologist's report recorded the hunger strikers' causes of death as ""self-imposed starvation"", later amended to simply ""starvation"" after protests from the dead strikers' families.[30] The coroner recorded verdicts of ""starvation, self-imposed"".[30]

- no not all Irish / Muslim people were / are terrorists
- there is an uneasy question about what proportion of the population are sympathetic to their cause / the values of extremists / the values on non-western, deeply religious societies - it was felt that many Irish people supported the IRA and it feels like that too many Muslims support some of the aims of terrorists

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_towards_terrorism#Polls

Seems to show that relatively small proportions of the muslims in western countries support it (but no comparative data to measure against)

""John Esposito, using poll data from Gallup, wrote in 2008 that Muslims and Americans were equally likely to reject violence against civilians. He also found that those Muslims who support violence against civilians are no more religious than Muslims who do not.[28]""

But there is some extremely alarming statistics on the attitudes of young muslims:

""According to a 2007 poll conducted by the PolicyExchange think tank in Britain, nearly 60% said they would prefer to live under British law, while 37% of 16 to 24-year-olds said they would prefer sharia law, against 17% of those over 55. Also, nearly a third of 16 to 24-year-olds believed that those converting to another religion should be executed.""

Obviously, but reporting about them without showing what you are reporting is hardly presenting the news in an unbiased way.

Yet the Guardian can control the narrative associated with the images.

They came and came their job the same

In relays N'er they stopped.

'Just sign the line!' They shrieked each time

And beat me 'till I dropped.

They tortured me quite viciously

They threw me through the air.

It got so bad it seemed I had

Been beat beyond repair.

The days expired and no one tired,

Except of course the prey,

And knew they well that time would tell

Each dirty trick they laid on thick

For no one heard or saw,

Who dares to say in Castlereagh

Generally speaking, most Christian countries are either world powers, or are so poor that they are insignificant. Islamic countries have the rare situation of being in unstable regions that have classically been prime strategic targets for global powers (and hence the reason why these countries are unstable)....

Islamic terrorists aren't committing these atrocities because they are genuinely offended by a few cartoons, they commit these atrocities because they want to turn the global powers against muslims. That way they can say ""look, the west hates you, join our cause and stand against them"". They want to start an anti-west uprising in the middle east, they want Europe to condemn Islamic countries, they want the middle east to be more unstable. Why? Because when a country is unstable, radical sects are able to overthrow the government. ISIS took power from the rubble of the Iraq war. And by convincing Muslims that the west hates them, they can convince others to join ISIS.

The fact is, ISIS hates the fact that we are tolerant of Islam. Because if we're tolerant of Islam, why on earth would any Muslim be convinced to join their ""destroy the west"" cause? It's only by manufacturing a conflict between Islam and the West that they are able to recruit members.


If there was any chance of a significant Christian country destabilising enough to allow an extremist Christian sect to rise to power, you would see more Christian terrorists.

The good:

- Their ISA pays about 1.5% I think, and the interest is paid monthly with no limits on paying in beyond the usual ISA restrictions, and no withdrawal penalties

Also, and I'd need to check on this, they MIGHT still be running an offer whereby if you leave within twelve months stating you're dissatisfied, they'll give you another £100 for leaving. At this point it would be easy to state you're unhappy with the online service which is pretty poor. Usable, and no reason not to switch to them, but it's not a patch on the really nicely put together websites like Lloyds.

What if this is simply what it appears to be, an act of iconoclasm and murder of iconographers? What if their statement that ""We have avenged the Prophet"" can be read simply, at face value? 

This notion that terrorism comes from poverty and instability has a great deal of truth to it. But I'm not entirely convinced that it's as simple as ""if Christian countries were unstable, they'd have Christian terrorists"". Some Christian countries are unstable and poor, such as in Latin America, and they don't really have Christian terrorists.

&gt;s she told a startled press conference at the Commonwealth summit in Vancouver, in 1987: “A considerable number of the ANC leaders are Communists… When the ANC says that they will target British companies, this shows what a typical terrorist organisation it is. I fought terrorism all my life… I will have nothing to do with any organisation that practises violence. I have never seen anyone from ANC or the PLO or the IRA and would not do so.”

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatcher-branded-ancterrorist-while-urging-nelson-mandelas-release-8994191.html

&gt;They were not entirely alone. Margaret Thatcher denounced the ANC as a “typical terrorist organization,” and one of her strongest supporters, Teddy Taylor, said Nelson Mandela  “should be shot.”

&gt;It wasn’t until David Cameron took over as Conservative leader that the mistake was owned: “The mistakes my party made in the past with respect to relations with the ANC and sanctions on South Africa make it all the more important to listen now.

&gt;“The fact that there is so much to celebrate in the new South Africa is not in spite of Mandela and the ANC, it is because of them – and we Conservatives should say so clearly today,” he said in 2006.

&gt;It’s easy with the passage of time to forget how the Conservative Right in Britain got it so badly wrong on South Africa, and today how long it has been since the British Left got it so right.

Freedom of speech aside, there are context-dependent lines you just shouldn't cross. Context-dependent, because if it's a stand-up show or otherwise overtly 'supposed to be comedy' setting, I think the lines are/should be relaxed. Just randomly portraying Muhammad as a stereotypical curtain wearer getting arse raped... I think it goes beyond the realm of 'begging for trouble' and back out the other side.

Trouble doesn't mean machine guns and bombs though. That's just the worst possible response to such a thing. A decently-sized 'fuck you' would cover it, seriously.

Imagine how it would go down if I went round putting Hitler 'taches on all pictures of David Cameron, or drew a comic strip portraying Nigel Farage as a male prostitute. People would be offended, and those guys aren't even religious figures.

A few thoughts come to mind:

1. The obvious insurance, illegal blah blah stuff you mentioned.

2. Will it play on your mind at all and take away from the pleasure of riding? It's different from going 90 on the motorway for a few miles on a deserted stretch, in that you are always riding at risk of being in trouble and you can't easily change that.

3. If you do get caught can you deal with the consequences (fine, points on licence, court, job, family etc.)?

4. How do the police check? Other than asking you as another poster said. Take you to a rolling road and check there most likely rather than pull the carb apart (or however yours is restricted).

5. Some bikes are going to attract more attention than others (R6 vs, say my DRZ which isn't much more than the restricted HP anyway).

For me points 2 and 3 would be the persuasive ones.

I think you've got that backwards. Our politics inevitably trends towards the 'centre' because our voting system only allows for a few parties to gain any meaningful representation in Parliament. It's similar to what happens in America with their seemingly unshakeable two-party system.

I'm glad to see you are keen, let me summarise the entire project to you.
The idea is fairly basic, but leads into a potentially great product with possibilities for loads of future projects and developments.
I'll summarise it for you: I'm sure you're familiar with Trackir, and my project falls into a very similar product with a few great improvements and changes. It combines infrared tracking capabilities and a conventional Web Cam, plus microphone, into a single product thanks to a sliding lens and filter array on the front. Their is also potential to integrate oculus rift point tracking as well, to help future-proof the product.
With regards to software, we would probably need to create custom point tracking software, which we could Base off of Freetrack or Open track.
I would like to develop and start selling a complete head tracking kit with camera, 3 point infrared tracking device (clip or cap, battery or usb etc.) and the custom software within a year, or however fast the project can move.
The whole idea at the moment is very very new, but the camera is patented so it is safe for the most part.
I'm looking for software engineers and hardware designers to join me, initially as we explore the idea as a reality then start the real work of establishing a company and brand once we have some capital to start seriously dedicating our time.
Until then, the whole idea is just speculative.
Let me know what you think of all this.

Mine expired on the 19th of December and I've left it in so far. Explanation below
I was always glad I had a restrictor since it forced me to plan ahead a bit more than if I had full power. Also, it made me concentrate more on getting faster through the corners than just flooring it on the straights and walking it round corners. I started feeling like I wanted more power towards the middle of June last year but left it in just incase of insurance(heard too many stories of them tryna wiggle their way out on a technicality that probably didn't affect the accident). Ended up breaking my leg on a 450 dirtbike(which had more power than my bike and a lot less weight) - part of the cause of the accident was me not “respecting” the bike(too much throttle). I’m planning on getting back on for the end of this month/middle of next and I’m gonna leave the restrictors in for a month or until I feel like I need more power.

If we do then Markovic is in an awkward spot regardless of if we have shaqiri or not because he's best on the flank and there aren't really wide attacking positions with the diamond.  I think we're much better in the diamond, but Rodgers has already shown us this season that he's very stubborn about it as we've had the players available to play it (Sterling and Balotelli as strikers with Lallana/Coutinho as CAM and one of the runners) for most of the season and he's avoided it completely.

If you add Balotelli back into the mix it's 6 players for 3 positions in the diamond as well:  one midfield runner in Coutinho/Lallana, one CAM for Sterling/Coutinho/Lallana/Markovic/Shaqiri, and then one striker for Sterling/Shaqiri/Markovic/Balotelli.

I think it's ideal to have 2 players for each spot.  Lallana/Coutinho/Sterling/Shaqiri/Markovic are all really versatile too, which is added benefit.

If Markovic isn't at the level where he can win us a game yet then we shouldn't be putting that kind of responsibility on him, regardless of money spent.  I think he was bought for the future anyway rather than instant impact.  It'll probably take him a solid 2 seasons to really catch fire.  He'll be much better next season and then amazing the season after next as he grows into things more.

Everything is permitted in this context is extremely similar to everything is possible, except that we know some things are not possible. It is almost saying that everything that is possible is permitted by nature. There are no other restrictions. Whilst humans may try and intervene with this, they cannot affect nature itself. No human law (such as a restriction on free speech) has any meaning on nature.

The concept of ""having rights"" is also subject to the fact of reality that is outlined with ""Everything is Permitted"". As much as nature allows us the ""right"" or ability to express ideas, it also allows others the ability to attempt to stop us. Nature expresses no preference. As such, the view that we have some sort of absolute right to anything that cannot be infringed is purely an agreed upon human construct. I quite like that it is, but to view it as anything more is silly.

As I said - would love it to happen, but its unlikely, very unlikely.

Edit - I don't know what the answer to this is, but it seems to me that the issue is we simply have too many cars. While I don't expect banning people from parking outside, or close to their home will work, I do expect the government to encourage the idea of other means of transport so in time, we can do away with out reliance on the car.

null,false,70_S_Dancer,knight,Dragon Knight,null,"I think you are being pretty unfair on this. I made it clear the use for acid spray to help phase out the enemy hero, if you throw it behind the enemy creep wave then you can effectively force your opponent into melee range of your carry or the other side of the AoE. This only works early but i believe that is the most crucial part of the game, hence why after getting 2 points, you wait till late game for the rest. Assuming your carry is not in need of direct support, acid is really good for helping you pull and farm so if you are not playing aggressively i see no need for higher stun level until 4 or 7.

If you read what i said correctly then i said getting the stun is good for when you are being aggressive and for going ham on enemies. Of course this means the build would change but i dont have time to write multiple im afraid.

I understand the comment about drums, but essentially it works as an item which atleast partially allows alch to take a direct part in fights earlier by addressing his areas of weakness almost wholesale as well as providing the active bonuses for the team.

If you have played support alch before and have your own style then i can see why you wouldnt like this build, but remember differences in mmr and playstyle and this works for me. My teammates often struggle to maintain strength throughout the game so util alch helps them focus on specific items. This build essentially makes alch very versatile but not effective alone, able to constantly be a supporting presence and keeping up with farm.",null,0,null,1420818335,null,0,false,0,cnjj3dg,null,t3_2rub3m,null,t1_cnjj3dg,null,t1_cnjfpnc,null,null,null,1424971312,null,1,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,1,null

In my opinion, there is sufficient research to suggest that we should ensure that GM Crops production is controlled, and that we do further research to find safer methods of it's mass production prior to deploying it nationally.

&gt; FA711 Many environmental problems have been associated with genetically modified (GM) crops:
&gt; 
&gt; (a) GM crops may cross-breed with wild varieties or wild species and transfer genes to other plants, posing a long-term threat to wildlife and biodiversity.
&gt; 
&gt; (b) Herbicide-resistant genes have been transferred to other plants, creating ‘super weeds’.
&gt; 
&gt; (c) Herbicides used with GM crops have been shown to harm both wildlife and human health.
&gt; 
&gt; (d) GM crops producing bio-pesticide toxins may be toxic to wildlife and encourage resistance in the target species.
&gt; 
&gt; (e) GM crops undermine organic and conventional farming through cross-contamination and by creation of resistant pests. 
&gt; 
&gt; FA712 The use of GM crops in poor countries has proved disastrous to farming communities. Not only have the crops failed in many cases, but they undermine the diversity of local seed varieties with monoculture GM crops designed to secure profits for multinational biotechnology companies. There is no evidence that GM crops will ‘solve’ the problem of world food shortages through increased productivity: there are many social and economic issues that need to be addressed to prevent food shortages in poorer countries. (See also ST362, ST370)

I can't believe I'm saying this, but Hibbert has performed better in that respect this season than Distin has.  He's not gonna blow by you, but he always knew where to be and has blocked a lot of crosses by positioning correctly.  Our other defenders push really far up but if the ball is lost in mid-field, they have almost no hope of reacting correctly - Jags is the only one I've seen who's been able to do it somewhat, and even then it's been a bit sketchy.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"The problem is far deeper than just the current Prime Minister.

In 2002, Gordon Brown commissioned a report into the future of the NHS, known as the Wanless report. 

This stated that a tipping point would be reached in about 10-20 years. This was due to an ageing population (due to demographic changes), increasing healthcare expectations, changes in social care (a progressive move away from multi-generation families, and the expectation that the state should provide social care), longer life expectancy for people with long-term illnesses, a greater range of healthcare technologies available and a progressive increase in the cost of healthcare as more treatment options become available.

It also pointed out that demand would increase faster than ability to staff the service, eventually leading to a point where service could not be sustained: fewer younger people would mean fewer available people to recruit for training as nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals. It also pointed out that increasing social mobility (including internationally) meant that the best staff may be lost forever due to emigration, if working conditions and achievable living standards were not competitive on the world stage.

We're now at the stage where nearly half of newly trained doctors leave the UK. It is nearly impossible to recruit new started GP trainees, because of huge cuts in salary, a media which encourages ""GP bashing"", declining working conditions, etc.

The current problem with funding has also been exaccerbated by the types of funding given in the past. In the mid 2000s, the government made a considerable amount of ""new initiatives"" funding available. These were capital grants for the purchase of new facilities, e.g. a new £2 million MRI scanner facility. However, the funding stream, did not provide for the running costs, which ended up being paid from the general budget. Most importantly, however, there was limited planning of budgets for replacement of the equipment at end of life. A lot of hospitals are really feeling the squeeze because they have a lot of 10 year old equipment (which is now regarded as absolutely essential) which the manufacturers can no longer support and is becoming unreliable and needs replacement - but the funding to replace it may not be there.

**Price of product:** £9 for 150ml, free shipping

**Where did you purchase:** eBay seller cosmeticmarket2012 (highly recommended)

**Product claims:** *""Is for all types of skin including sensitive. Instead of water the product uses snail secretion filtrate and Camellia sinensis leaf water, bee venom and EGF to cleanse your rough and damaged skin from various stresses and pollution. In addition to the skin soothing, moisture supply and skin tone improvement functions, niacinamide and adenosine contents of the product help you whitening your skin and remove wrinkles.""*

Note that in Asian skincare 'whitening' means brightening or reducing hyperpigmentation.

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased partly thanks to [this rosacean blogger] (https://pheomelaninsufficient.wordpress.com/) and because the ingredients are impressive.

**Your opinion:** Unfortunately my first bottle of this toner got lost by Royal Mail, but eBay seller cosmeticmarket2012 communicated well and refunded promptly. Their images of full sized products and packaging also include ingredients lists where they are available.

The brown packaging is unisex and the whole Benton line is unfragranced so has potential for gifting to males or anyone with sensitive skin (except those allergic to bee stings). Given how watery toner is I would have preferred a spray to a pump dispenser. Not a luxurious or exciting product to use, but a functional one.

**Ingredients:** *""Snail secretion filtrate, green tea leaf hydrosol, glycerin, niacinamide (2%), human oligopeptide-1 (EGF), bee venom, persimmon leaf extract, willow bark extract, Plantago asiatica extract, brown algae extract, elm extract, Japanese pepper extract, Pulsatilla koreana extract, lichen extract, hollyhock root extract, aloe leaf extract, betaine, bacillus ferment, panthenol, beta glucan, allantoin, azelaic acid, adenosine.""*

* [Turn It Up (high-yerrrrrrrrr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PPJ9Fw580A) (re-do of one of his older tracks under his old name, Stan SB)
* [Simple Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNCfWEMhAhs)
* [All In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqfQnD_MMe4)

Of those I'd be tempted to say Simple Life because we've being waiting for it to be released since aruond 2011 when Stan first released some previews of it. All This Time is just amazing though, the intro is perfection and it just gets better from there. Out There is great fun too.

Songs by other artists include

* [Simga Ft. Paloma Faith - Changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAeotgCHL3E) A very good DnB artist teaming up with one of my favourite non-DnB artists! I listened to this on repeat for almost two weeks after I first heard it.

* [Thomas Bergersen - Our Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHMspRL5HP8) Something a little different. One of the guys from Two Steps From Hell, I love the long intro and then the superhero-movie-esque fanfare. I love [Empire of Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udem7fvZiHc) from the same album too, although it's maybe a little repetitive for a song of the year.

* [Matrix &amp; Futurebound Ft. Tanya Lacey - Don't Look Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGB4lB9VVBI) more DnB I'm afraid.. This was my summer.

* [Raise Spirit - When You're Ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIF9N5LbL0). Dat guitar solo doe.

This is the lack of nuance that causes Islamofacism and its opposames. Humans do not think all the same. Christians do not all believe the same thing. Popes say things about homsexuality that have changed. During enlightened Islamic caliphates jews, christians and moors lived in more cultured peaceful enclaves than anywhere else in europe. You can use belief in christianity to convince yourself that every christian believes in an eye for an eye or that every christian believes in turn the other cheek.  The real threat to civilisation is fascism and its refusal to countenance nuance. That's true of ISIS who worship the same god as Hitler or Mao or Stalin. Which is that of the 'one true god' and his appointed messengers, that anyone who does not bow before it can be killed to bring about a more enlightened age. However the death of nuance only ever brings about an age of fascism whether the priest caste are capitalists (germany), communists (russia/china), or muslims is irrevelant.

The logic that collapses a farmer in bangladesh with a french-algerian student who shoots a cartoonist is bogus and bankrupt.

The acid spray or stun is situational depending on the game, but if you make the correct choice it can make winning the lane a doddle. I feel with the acid spray this build is strong at level 1 but weakest between level 2 and 6; I find it very successful at making sure your carry gets a good early lead. This enables you to focus on pulling, giving you and your carry more room to get farm, or if your carry needs more support then you have the stun to use defensively at level 2 and the acid spray to continue to phase out the opposition. Obviously this wouldn't work for aggression but that's the distinction between the decision between acid spray and stun in the first place.

In terms of whether my team is useless, I feel that this build wouldn't work in the mid game if that were the case. Early and late you can easily hold your own 1v1 but mid game you lack damage and maneuverability and so rely on others. Essentially you are there to be as useful to your team as possible as both a tank and a util hero. If you pick up mek and pipe then pos 5 has gold to spend on euls or aghs or other items.

Hollande is currently their most disliked president ever. Raising taxes does not work.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Does he or does he not apologise though? 

An apology means nothing when you say you think the action your apologising for was necessary.

&gt; The shooting of innocents by the IRA (which I find despicable) was done for the most part in response to Loyalist killings of Catholics.

I. Do. Not. Care. They still killed innocent people. The Loyalist killings were also wrong (and notably fewer). However, no Loyalist leader stood up recently and declared terrorism wrong. Therefore i'm not addressing their hypocrisy.

&gt;You're correct in saying that planting powerful bombs inspired some hard-line republicans to join the IRA, but that is not the main reason they bombed

No the main reason was to inspire terror in the public who disagreed with them and force their way of life and politics on an unwanting population. Therefore terrorism.

&gt;I don't think the IRA were afraid of starting an 'all out war' (they were already referring to it as a war during the Troubles) 

If that were true we would have had a war. An actual war. Them pretending they fought a war doesn't make it so.

&gt;I can't think of any case in which a child was specifically targeted by the IRA - perhaps punishment beatings et cetera, but I suppose that was more anti-social teenagers and spides than innocent children. 

Firstly, fuck you for even trying to insinuate that being anti-social or a spide means it's acceptable to be killed as a child. Secondly, there were several instances of bombs outside schools (including mine when I was 13, at my busstop).

null,false,DogBotherer,null,null,null,"I think Marx himself, were he alive today, would be the first to admit that his analysis was of a c19th economic system and not a c21st one, so whatever his key insights were at the time, in their original form they are mostly of historical rather than directly applicable significance.  However, obviously Marxian economists and neo-Marxists haven't been idle in the interim, and there is a whole modern tradition of critical theory which owes its broad form if not its detail to insights within his seminal work.

I recommend reading (at least the first volume of) Capital if you never have.  There are a few difficult chapters, but it's often pretty readable - even funny at times.  David Harvey's series of lectures is a good option to have your hand held through it, with many years of study to provide a lot of unique and perspicacious insights.  

I don't mean to sound cultish, but because it's a totally different perspective on economics, I'd be very reluctant to offer my take on his key insights given I'm an outsider at best - really an antagonist, you're better off hearing from Marx himself (or at least having a Marxist summarise them), but just as a ""for instance"" of something which was very effective as a critique of what came before and has stood the test of time despite some pretty aggressive and some plainly misconceived Austrian assaults, his demolition job on Say's law is telling, making the distinction of use and exchange values and, I suppose, more broadly his [crisis theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=BhZGOWPcMAU#t=617) (it's all interesting, but about 30 minutes in is the most relevant), which has proved much more useful - not least for the global business community - during and following the current economic woes than the vast majority of traditional neoclassical economics.",null,0,null,1420820906,null,0,false,0,cnjkkpb,null,t3_2rudtl,null,t1_cnjkkpb,null,t1_cnjg6wm,null,null,null,1424970622,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null
