I just had a google around for the statistics, an [FOI request](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/number-of-schools-teachers-and-students-in-england/number-of-schools-teachers-and-students-in-england) from 2013 states that there were around 438,000 teachers then. Making the assumption that the net total is roughly the same now as then, this marks about an 11% turnover in staff in a year.

If you look at [this](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223563/SFR15_2013_tables_17072013.xlsx) you can see the information about numbers of teachers in salary band by age, but from this you can also look in the column just before the end at the number of staff in each age range in each type of school. I can't be bothered to go through the maths, but it looks like around 8-9% of the staff are in the age range 50 - 60+ in secondary schools. When you consider that that puts many within the grasp of retirement or early retirement, and also add on the other types of things that lead to people leaving their jobs, such as illness, death, etc, there's probably still a statistically significant number leaving due to the profession, but much lower.

He was excellent last season playing that role, at least in an attacking sense.

One of the great things about being completely by yourself in the wilderness is the sense of solitude and self-reflection. That can be completely broken by a burned patch on the ground, a candy bar wrapper, or a discarded bottle--this is the main difference between your town bonfire and a bonfire in the backcountry. Plus, though it may be OK in your individual situation, imagine if *everybody* lit a fire in a relatively popular back country camping area.  This is all leaving aside the risk issue, which is very real. I don't know statistics here, but in California there were several major forest fires started by careless campers. Obviously it's not as much of a risk in the UK, but peat and roots can catch fire underground and not be immediately obvious. This is my philosophy, at least. As I said earlier, I try to adhere to leave-no-trace pretty stringently (though I don't pack out poo unless I'm mountaineering). 

Camp stoves are far more practical and lightweight. Mine fits into the palm of my hand and weighs a hair over 100g. Anyone going into the wilderness for an extended period of time will always be carrying a stove. Even though I hope you would reconsider, if you do end up lighting a fire, see if you can find an established fire pit in the area first. Build it on rock if possible to avoid peat danger.

[The charity Allergy UK report that 50% of lactose intolerant people are 'self diagnosed'](http://www.allergyuk.org/downloads/Corporate%20/Dairy-Intolerance-Report---Feb-2013-V3.pdf)

Researchers also believe that types of carbohydrates known as Fodmaps are the likely cause of chronic gut pain and other symptoms often attributed to gluten intolerance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; According to Dr Miranda Lomer, Senior Consultant Dietitian at King’s College London, the low-Fodmap diet has been “extremely successful” in treating the symptoms of IBS and other gut conditions by identifying, through a process of elimination, particular problem foods. Treatment involves placing patients on a strict low-Fodmap diet for 4–8 weeks, after which foods are gradually reintroduced and monitored over 2–3 months to identify those that trigger symptoms. Sufferers can then remove these foods from their diets long-term.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr Lomer said in recent years there had been an increase in the number of people self-diagnosing gluten intolerance and needlessly placing themselves on gluten-free diets without proper medical advice. She said only people with coeliac disease – an autoimmune condition that causes gut inflammation when gluten is ingested and affects 1 per centof the population – needed to go gluten-free.",null,0,null,1422953468,null,0,false,0,co9nw2t,null,t3_2ul137,null,t1_co9nw2t,null,t1_co9nqav,null,null,null,1424239845,null,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10,null

[Here is a part of a transcript from a debate on this exact issue on 16th October 2012. Speaking is Jenny Chapman, Labour's Shadow Minister for Justice:](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2012-10-16a.32.1)

&gt; Of course, that is true. If something positive can come out of this debate, it might be a sense that in raising issues concerning women we are not solely concerned about women offenders. What is true, however, is that we could have much more success with that group of offenders if they were dealt with slightly differently. Given that we have such a problem with reoffending, it makes perfect sense to break offenders down into groups to be dealt with and with whom we could first have some success.

&gt; The Labour Government accepted almost all of Corston’s 43 recommendations, and a lot of good progress was made. Five years on, some of the achievements that we should be most proud of are the end to mandatory strip searching and the targeted investment in community and diversion services for women. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend Maria Eagle who, according to my right hon. Friend Mr Straw, argued ferociously for change and did not stop until she got her way—a fine example of the effectiveness of a women’s justice champion, a role that has, sadly, been conspicuous by its absence in the first two years of this Government.

&gt; Progress, I am disappointed to report, has stalled. I have already noted that the current Secretary of State for Justice did not find time to make women a priority in his conference speech, although, to be fair to him, he is simply following the example set by a Government who did not include a single mention of female offenders in a Bill with the size and scope of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. The Secretary of State has made much of his desire to be tough on crime and, even more perhaps, of his fractious relationship with community sentencing. This is not about being hard or soft, however, but about what works, and smart community interventions are the most effective way to sentence and rehabilitate the majority of women who enter the criminal justice system. Such reform is tough on crime, as it reduces it. When I asked staff and service users at the Pankhurst women’s centre in Manchester
what needed to change, they answered that politicians needed to grow a backbone—they were actually a lot less polite, but I think we know what they meant.

&gt; In opposition, Labour has continued our commitment to such reform—this month my right hon. Friend Sadiq Khan announced plans to set up a women’s justice board. Reducing the number of the women in prison, he argued, should be a priority for any Government. The Secretary of State for Justice is not known for his desire to reduce the prison population, but if our criminal justice system is to be sensible and effective and provide value for money, it may be time for the Government to think outside the gates.",null,0,null,1422954755,null,0,false,0,co9o6fu,null,t3_2uj56b,null,t1_co9o6fu,null,t1_co97xwy,null,null,null,1424239711,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

You ever given anyone a birthday present? Why does that thing become theirs? Because you will it? The next time you give your partner a present, do I get to kick in the front door and say, 'You apparently don't believe in the concept of private property passing from one private citizen to another, therefore to save you from your own hypocrisy and moment of weakness, I'm seizing this in the name of the Greater Good^TM and putting in the treasury""? 

Why not? Because you will otherwise? Because you have the freedom to make choices about what happens to your things and who they pass to. Oh. Right. I see. So you're either full of sit or living a lie. What it must be like to be you.

&gt;A world in which ancestry has no effect on prosperity.

Yeah because that's possible, mate. Really. Your utopian dream is only ever one general election away. You keep telling yourself that.

&gt;The dead are incapable of possession

Yeah but that's why it's called a last will and testament. It is your final recorded choice. Your last act as a member of a free society. You get to say what happens to your things. If you don't have one your things are taken and your partner would have to go through probate to get them.

&gt;and the distribution of wealth is the opposite of selfishness

No it's not. The distribution of YOUR OWN wealth is the opposite of selfishness, but a peaceful mob creating political mandates and passing laws wherein the State gives itself power to dip its hands into other people's pockets isn't the opposite of selfishness. The opposite of selfishness is, by definition, selflessness. There is NOTHING less selfless that a State can do than seize assets from it's own people under the threat of taking away their freedoms. If I don't pay my taxes bailiffs come round and take my things BY FORCE. Force. They force their way into my home, and they start taking valuable things, and if I resist they call the police and the police manhandle me and throw me in a cell where I lose my freedoms. And you consider his to be the opposite of selfish? You consider this a sacrifice made by individuals?

Have you ever made serious sacrifices for people you don't know? Just the other week I was at a local Youth Club playing 5-a-side with some lads. I wasn't paid, and I paid for my own DBS check which cost me £26. I get one every year so I'm clear to volunteer in my local community as I'm able. Maybe you can make an argument that I'm taking the place of one of the lads (I wasn't) or that I'm doing it as a means of staying healthy. I have a three month old son and I'd like to spend time with him, but I volunteer once a week at the local Youth Club because it gives troubled kids something to do with their evenings. Maybe they don't want to be at home to hear their parents shouting. Maybe it's to stop them running with the wrong crowd.

What do you do? Do you volunteer in any local community initiatives off your own back? Are you selfless? Or do you sit online and delude yourself into thinking that because you have left wing sensibilities and get angry when you read inflammatory Guardian articles or nod when you hear a Labour politician talking that you're a good, selfless person?

How in the name of sound reason can you convince yourself that barging into a family's most private moments of grief and saying, 'Tke everything, lads. TV, DVD player, the photos on the wall, that leather chair looks valuable. Who's got the login details for his online banking? You? Good. All right. Is that everything? OK, let's go,'  isn't selfish? Simply mindblowing. I'm staggered.

&gt;You don't know what that was, do you?

It was a moment in human history when the concept of private possession fell through the floor and the fallout from that idea created ripples which oppressed a nation for the better part of a century.

Errr ... no, not really. 

The proper way to do it is;

""The Islamic form of slaughtering animals or poultry, dhabiha, involves killing through a cut to the jugular vein, carotid artery and windpipe."" - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27324224

Remember way back, saw a documentary on a slaughter house. 

The regular industrial way (note, this was a fair few years back, so things could of changed by now) was;

1) Grab a sheep. 

2) Stun shock it. 

3) Bolt through the head. 

4) Repeat with next sheep. 

**Edit ; My bad, found the show and it was Kosher slaughter they did.**

http://youtu.be/I41IYWb_Mus?t=27m1s

End of edit. 

In the show, they also showed a Halal meat job. It was fecking surreal to watch. Mostly for the casualness of the guy doing it. 

1) Bring in animal (was a cow in this case). 

2) Put down paper and mug of tea. 

3) Read off a little tasmiya or shahada.

4) Cut the whole neck bit. 

5) Sit down with paper, tea, and wait for animal to drain out. 

I'm not saying it was the niceness thing. Seemed a damn sight nicer than shocking and bolt through the brain, polite nice. 

Think the slowness of the act, and the call for more meat (mass production and mass consumption) is forcing more ""get it in, get it done, ship it out"" workings in the industry. Because who cares what happens behind a closed door on an industrial estate, long as food got the right labels on it.

If you like eye products, I would also recommend Kiko as someone else has done. Their prices are on par with Drugstore brands, and the eye-products are really quality. I can recommend their chubby eye shadow sticks (a bit hard to blend, but they don't budge once they set!), the slightly thinner eye shadow sticks (creamy, but also super long lasting) or the ""water"" individual eyeshadow (don't own any but they've got good reviews and my own swatches in shops showed they're really pigmented).

One of my favourite (and first ever) go-to lip products is Revlon Matte Balm in Sultry, it's one of those colours that looks a bit different on everyone but if you like matte colours it's worth checking out! I like the Bourjois chubby stick balms too, for just a bit of tint with moisture. If you're interested in something a bit stronger, the Bourjois Velvet Edition matte liquid lipsticks are really great (and comfy to wear), though I don't own any of the nude-ish colours. I love the Sleek Matte Me liquid lipsticks, they have a great nude called Birthday Suit! I'd also recommend the Rimmel lip liners, they're much better than the Maybelline ones I own.

If you want pencil eye-liners, you probably know about Rimmel Scandaleyes! A lot of people really like the Soap &amp; Glory liquid liner but I really don't like it :( I prefer a L'Oreal one. I would warn you against getting any MUA/MUR palette without swatching it first, because in my experience they can have some really disappointing shadows... Which is fine, but just check so you know what you're getting. I think the quality of Sleek is a little bit better but I'm not entirely sure.

Halal slaughter is (probably) crueler than modern slaughter methods, but nothing really outrageous in this investigation is a result of the halal slaughter method (in fact, the workers clearly breach Islamic law about halal slaughter multiple times) - it is a result of the callous disregard for the well-being of the animal to be slaughtered. If you don't think *exactly* the same thing happens in western abattoirs, you are kidding yourself. If you want to campaign to end cruel practices to animals, halal slaughter presents itself as an easy, compelling and ultimately pointless target; if you care about the well-being of animals you need to campaign for animal welfare to be genuinely enshrined in law.

Let me give an example which I think people have overlooked completely; these practices weren't exposed by an employee blowing the whistle on the practices. They weren't exposed by the company's own internal audit processes catching the cruel treatment of animals. They weren't even exposed by government regulators doing their jobs. They were exposed by some charity going undercover with a camera and giving the story to the press (something which is actually illegal in most of America, thanks to restrictive ag-gag laws). And then the press appear to have sat on the footage until now, because they can use the story to inflame religious hatred at this particular point (the charity has been doing this since 2009, the paper chooses to report it in 2015).

If you want to do something to help animals, you should *demand* better personal accountability, internal audit and government oversight of the meat industry, not call for some poxy ban on one particular slaughter method.",null,0,null,1422957978,null,0,1422978034,0,co9otxz,null,t3_2um5ej,null,t1_co9otxz,null,t3_2um5ej,null,null,null,1424239406,null,169,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,169,null

Interesting. I don't really have a problem with the idea of doing this kind of matching, but (besides the legal difficulties) I think it's daft to make ""100% accurate"" claims for things that either clearly aren't or that stand a good chance of not being. It's not only unprovable it also makes a poor case for a good idea, viz: Get a computer to do some of the matching and make better use of someone's time.
  
&gt; Now what the actual problem is, is its this actually legal.  
  
I agree that's where the source of the difficulty lies. I can't see the judiciary having a problem with the act of searching for suspects, or even automating that process as long as there's a human making the final decision to bring people in for questioning, &amp;c. The problem has to do with the data set the automatic matching tool is running against. The law is quite clear that as a data processor you can't just hang onto people's data for as long as you like - you can only retain it for as long as is absolutely necessary to do the job you originally and legitimately obtained that data for. Which means that if the police originally took your photo because you were a suspect, and then it turned out that it wasn't you (either because you were tried and freed, or it never got to trial) then they're not entitled to hold onto that data after that point. This is a point that's been quite clearly established in Law through various judgements. Which means that in all likelihood most of the photos on this DB are in breach of the Data Protection Act and the police stand a good chance of getting themselves sued. Which, as they're a public body and could easily avoid this kind of situation by the simple exercise of thinking, means they're pretty much deliberately wasting public money (and police time).

I think it's more about how those images are stores, how long for, and who has access.

My local town runs its own CCTV network and team to combat crime in the town. They have weekly meetings where they discuss crimes and what's being done. During these meetings they pass around mugshots of offenders. But it's not allowed to keep images of suspected offenders taken from their own CCTV network. Any still images they get has to be of arrested individuals **and** given to them by the police.

That bolded part is important. They can't use CCTV images of known offenders from their own network by themselves. Any images they have have to be given to them by the police, even if those images were taken from their own CCTV.

This is also why I'm not worried when people talk about a ""big brother"" society. Most people talk about it like they can follow you around all day and store everything you do. They can't. CCTV aren't allowed to follow you around unless there is reasonable suspicion. The police in my town had to go to court and specifically get an order to be able to follow a known sex offender because using the CCTV to keep an eye on him would have been a breach of his rights without this order and reasonable belief that he was likely to offend.

Computer performance for facial recognition surpassed humans some time ago. It's pretty robust and can use characteristics human observers won't see. There are a couple of papers by an author named AJ O'Toole, including one in the last few months in IVC. There's also [this overview](http://www.cs.msu.edu/~stockman/Book/projects.html/F09Docs/Readings/humanFaceID.pdf) that shows some of the capabilities of computer recognition over human.

&gt; And humans are the people programming the system?

The humans programming the system probably won't know what the system does. Take the kinect for example, it uses an algorithm called random forests - one of many common machine learning techniques. At each branch of each tree that makes up this forest a basic classification decision is made. The number and complexity of branches is often more than human researchers can fully comprehend. All they know is that there's some criteria, some features and some operators. How they actually go together can be a bit of a mystery.

This doesn't make them unreliable, but I can see how this would make people wary, even before the privacy issues this topic brings.

There's a great story on machine learning in computer vision on page 24 of this [book](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BrnHR7esWmkC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=Ux0v_obAMM&amp;dq=pattern%20recognition%20tank%20cloudy&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=pattern%20recognition%20tank%20cloudy&amp;f=false) or here: https://neil.fraser.name/writing/tank/",null,0,null,1422959521,null,0,false,0,co9p4kj,null,t3_2ulyru,null,t1_co9p4kj,null,t1_co9mu4n,null,null,null,1424239268,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

If you want a new car, that's fine. Lots of people want new cars. Don't try and make a value argument for it though, because it's a total illusion. The cheapest car is *always* the one you own. A car is not an ""investment"", it is a depreciating asset. You will not only pay interest on the finance, but depreciation will eat into the value from day one.

£700 a month income is not really sufficient to support any sort of borrowing.

A brand new car is a luxury for anybody. I can't justify the costs; my preference is to buy cars that are a year or two old, where the steepest hit of appreciation has been had. It's still a massive luxury compared to alternative options, but then I earn significantly more than £700 per month.

Against AC Milan in the Quarter Final of the Champions League he setup Crouchy for our only goal in typical pacey fashion.

People love to criticise Azza, but there's a reason why he's stayed around the first 11 under 5 managers. He works incredibly hard for the team. He isn't particularly flashy, but when he had a run of games and got some confidence he could become un-playable. Together with Bale they were arguably the best wing-duo in the league under Redknapp. Plus, we shouldn't forget how much effort he puts in every week. Very few wingers provide as much defensive cover as he has, whilst still posing problems for his full-back. And his attitude has been pretty decent, too, from what I've seen.

So yeah, he's not World Class, but he has been such a good servant for the club, and we shouldn't forget the role he has played in some of our best seasons in recent history.

Some Parents Who Work for Elite Silicon Valley Firms Send Their Children to School with No Computers

&gt; The chief technology officer of eBay sends his children to a nine-classroom school here. So do employees of Silicon Valley giants like Google, Apple, Yahoo and HP. But the school’s chief teaching tools are anything but high-tech: pens and paper, knitting needles and, occasionally, mud. Not a computer to be found. No screens at all.

Yes he provided great cover for the full back, but that is all anyone has really said about him for the last three or four years.... Id rather an attacking winger than full back cover.

He came with so much promise and so much speed but obviously never worked hard enough on his final ball or his crossing and never used his speed full to his advantage. I remember him terrorsing Evra on more than a few occasions, really running him ragged and yet he didnt do anything with that.

26 goals in ten years and not many more assists to boast is nowhere near where he should be.

Granted, the Teslas are the top end electric car models, but they're already showing that motorway travel is viable on electric cars, as most aren't going to be doing that kind of distance regularly.

On the other end, the new Nissan Leaf has a range of 120 miles, which is more than enough for someone to pop down the motorway from Sheffield to Manchester and back, or, driving from London to Manchester, and charging on the way while having lunch. 

Tesla's supercharging stations can (so they claim) do 170miles of charge in 30minutes, which makes long motorway travel definitely viable, charging while you get some lunch or something at a service station.

Once the rest of the market catches up with this, electric travel will definitely become more viable for all driving ranges.

edit: No need to downvote the guy for being mistaken.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"It isn't unusual in the UK for people in high offices to receive knighthoods based on their role especially if there is a charitable element to it, so the media portrayal here is fairly subdued. It's part of the institution of monarchy. Most articles about it have mentioned it only because its caused a stir. Chances are it wouldn't have been mentioned otherwise. 

Prince Philip's antics are usually regarded in the UK with casual amusement. It's well worth reading a biography of his life, as although he tends to be well known for his xenophobic gaffs in later life (which I suspect is actually just a very British sense of humor that responds to offending people) he has actually had a fairly remarkable life. He saw extensive action in the Royal Navy during the second world war and was mentioned in dispatches several times. He was born a minor royal and his family were exhiled from Greece while he was a baby, and so although he had a good upbringing by the standard of the time, he wasn't the doted-on-Royal people might imagine. 

It strikes me the situation in Australia has less to do with Prince Philip or the Knighthood itself, and more to do with Australia's own perception of itself and it's place in the world. I've noticed that Australians increasingly seem to be torn between the western world they come from and the more pacific-oriented nation they *think* they ought to be. The irony is, there are widely accepted views (particularly about immigration) in Australia that would be abhorred in the UK. From my own experience, UK public perception is that Australians are actually relatively more racist by comparison to people in the UK.

I think most of us in the UK are of the belief that it's only a matter of time before Australia becomes a republic, probably under a populist movement at some point in the next 20-30 years and most likely following Queen Elizabeth II's death. To what extent that really matters I don't know. Monarchy works well for us and provides us with stability. I don't think many of us really care what you lot do.

&gt;

&gt;A notorious [practical joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke), Parrish is known to have carried out various pranks.

&gt;


&gt;* He is permanently banned from the Chinese administrative region of [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau) after blowing a [brothel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothel) up with a home-made bomb made out of firecrackers, when several of his fellow riders were being 'serviced' inside.

&gt;


&gt;* He burnt down a toilet block in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland). 

&gt;


&gt;* He once posed as a medical doctor to allow [John Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopkins_(motorcycle_racer\)) to fly from Japan to the Australian GP. 

&gt;


&gt;* He upset his fellow village residents by registering PEN 15 as his car number plate.

&gt;


&gt;* He once sabotaged a [Mini Moke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Moke) belonging to Team Bike, (a group of benefactors, mechanics, racers, journalists and helpers) by undoing every single wheel-nut to the last thread, in a revenge prank. The prank was discovered shortly before the vehicle was going to be driven off. 

&gt;


&gt;* He once posed as Barry Sheene in a qualifying session when the two were team-mates, as Sheene had turned up to the session with a hangover. Parrish put on Sheene's helmet/overalls and qualified on his behalf, then put his own clothing back on and qualified further down the grid as himself. 

&gt;


&gt;* Parrish owns an ambulance and has been seen using the ambulance to park on double yellow lines with the doors open in visits to his local bank. 

&gt;


&gt;* He also owns a fire engine and once hosed down the inside of a friend's packed pub on a Sunday afternoon.

The irony is your cynicism about politicians is more representative of his facile worldview than anyone's decision not to vote. Democracy isn't about choosing the shiniest of two turds - if someone feels that no party represents them, and they believe that the system is fundamentally undemocratic, then they have every right not to vote. I respect that person more than someone who votes tactically or just throws a cross in a random box for the hell of it. Just because you vote doesn't mean you're actually helping democracy.

The reason a low turnout would bother them - which is obvious to everyone and, I suspect, to you as well - is that it would mean they'd have no mandate. It would cause a political crisis. If a government got in on an election where only 10% turned out there'd be a fucking riot in Westminster.

The higher the turnout, the more they're satisfied that things are working the way they are. There's no option to say ""I have spoiled my ballot because I oppose the system"" or ""I've voted for UKIP but actually it's just a protest vote and I think they're a bunch of nutters"".

You'd probably be better off asking your waiter if the animal was stun-slaughtered than halal, because some halal meat is stun-slaughtered and not all non-halal meat is stun slaughtered (kosher meat, for example). I tell you this because I think you would rather know than not, so you avoid eating non-stun meat by mistake, not because I'm trying to trap you with a 'gotcha' or anything.

But with regard to your wider point I'm not entirely convinced... Let me tell you what I think your position is, and you can tell me whether I'm right or not. So I think you think:

&gt; ""I should boycott (as far as possible) all animal products which come from animals not slaughtered in the most humane way possible, since cruelty to animals is inevitable during food production but should be avoided during slaughter. Since non-stun slaughter is avoidable and crueler than the alternative, I will boycott all meat which is not stun-killed""

Is that roughly what you think? Because the reason I am unconvinced if that *is* what you think is that there are many other practices which occur during slaughter which are both cruel and avoidable which you should also boycott to be consistent. Just to pick one example out of many, many abattoirs in the UK will have the slaughter line set up such that animals still to be killed can see other animals ahead dying, which distresses them and is (reasonably) easily avoidable. Should you not ensure that you avoid meat made in this way too? I put it to you that seeing your friends die and knowing you are next is considerably crueler than non-stun slaughter, so if anything it is the priority to boycott.

Nothing to do with being a knight though. 

It's hardly been mentioned here. My Australian friends on Facebook went apoplectic over it. I can't recall my British friends on Facebook mentioning it - and they're shouty ""outraged"" liberal types who hate the monarchy and Murdoch, etc. 

Personally, I thought it was pretty humorous and utterly meaningless. Abbott is a such non-leader and is seen as a National and International embarrassment. 

You have to look at it from a technical and lawful point of view. [A knighthood is given in recognition of achievements](http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Knighthoods.aspx). 

Prince Philip did found the [Duke of Edinburgh Award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh's_Award). He does do stuff, and he uses his position as a Prince to achieve things that most other people can't achieve. 

He also says a lot of things which are controversial. Does that have anything to do with his *achievements*? I guess Abbott didn't think so, so he made the decision to give him a knighthood.

From my reading of knighthoods, I think it was lawful for Abbott to grant a knighthood if he thought Prince Philip was deserving, but I think it might have been political suicide for Abbott.

Did Prince Philip want, or care, about the knighthood? I guess that's a point for another discussion.

However, the figures charged are absolute nonsense and make a mockery of any genuine claim for breaching a contract. As outlined [here](http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/faq/private-parking-penalties/): 

&gt; *AppealNow.com is now recommending motorists to appeal to POPLA. The reason is that the Lead Adjudicator of POPLA has now published a key case in which it was decided that the parking company must demonstrate that the amounts they are demanding are genuine pre-estimates of their loss. In other words the amount demanded must be only for costs or expenses incurred as a result of the motorists alleged breach of contract. So they cannot charge for the salaries and other overheads of running or maintaining the car park. Nor can they claim for back office staff. In Barrie's view they can claim for posting you the demand but not much else. Motorists  should as part of the initial appeal ask theparking company to  demonstrate that the amount demanded is a genuine pre-estimate of loss*


As I have said up there ^ I used this exact argument with the company who tried to fine me, to ask them to explain how their demand for payment equated to genuine losses, and subsequently had the fine waived. An £80-plus fine (which as most people know, is roughly the minimum these people charge) for parking in a free carpark is not a fair estimate of losses under a breach of terms, and you'd be nuts to think it is.

That said I can't imagine the intent of halal is to be intently cruel when I'm not sure I can really think of a better way of slaughtering animals before we could properly stun them.
 
This I think is why it can be permissible to stun the animal so long as it's not killed and doing this, rather than using the bolt to both stun and kill, is where the the ""cruelty"" comes in. This is because it's unquestionably less effectively at knocking animals like cows out meaning some are aware when their throat is cut. From that point of view I tend to be unsympathetic to people who object to that but still otherwise eat meat but I'm a vegetarian for these kind of ethical reasons so I have an obvious bias.

It is probably a principle that most would agree to that once you have discharged your societal obligation by paying any due tax, the remainder should be at your lawful disposal to do with as you please, including bequeathing to your own kin.

However our sense of meritocracy and fairness of opportunity for all in society rubs against the result of this study.  Without challenging the freedom of disposal of property after taxation, we are then drawn as you say to look at tax itself and question whether it is reflecting the principles and values of the society we want.  

Currently the tax burden in general falls much higher on income (Reward for merit in the present) than on wealth (Reward for merit in the past).  Inheritance tax is not necessarily the only approach to tax wealth and although could be considered the most just of all taxes (""You can't take it with you when you die!"") it is also the most avoidable through making gifts through ones life.  My own view is that a more consistent approach to taxing wealth throughout ones life is a fairer way.

You want a car that's done average mileage so something that has done around 9000-12000 a year for every year of its age so something 10 years old you want to be looking around 90-120,000 miles. But make sure at that mileage cambelts have been done or use the cost of changing one (£150-£300) to haggle down the price.

You also want to avoid cars reaching multiples of 70,000 miles. 70,000 miles seems to be around when expensive things need replacing like clutches.

I completely disagree with you here Halk. Academics have been telling us for years that the largest macroeconomic risk is a liquidity trap. Not a day goes by where there isn't some macroeconomic professor lecturing us on the dangers of the Zero Lower Bound and the risks of austerity politicking in such an environment. 

And on the contrary there was never any chance that the market would start believing the UK would default, because we have our own central bank. So what is the macroeconomic risk? Under what circumstances will the UK government ever not be able to guarantee sustainability of debt?

It is sad because there are real debates to be had and we are not having them. We could talk more about the ideal size of the state or the 'productivity puzzle', for example. Instead the narrative is firmly fixed on government budget deficit (ok, not always, but generally speaking).

Slaughter without prior stunning is not allowed in any other place, even for personal consumption. Only cattle, sheep, goats, turkeys, chickens, hens, guinea fowl, ducks, geese and quail may be slaughtered in accordance with the rules of Islam.

The law now permits Qurbani/Udhia to be made:

by a licensed Muslim slaughterman
by the Islamic method, and
in a licensed slaughterhouse which is under official veterinary supervision.
Qurbani / Udhia is not permitted in fields, farm buildings, domestic or other premises.

Muslims who wish to make Qurbani / Udhia are encouraged to make arrangements with suppliers in good time before Eid-ul-Adha.

Nor was it an invoice. It's a notice. That's all. A notice from the company to state that they believe you have broken their terms of contract - ""contract"" being your apparent agreement to enter under their terms by parking in the first place. 

&gt; Just because the parking is free doesn't mean there's no losses. You could be taking up a parking space that someone who would be spending money in the retail park you're over-parking in could be using. You are then depriving businesses of that money. If they can demonstrate that the average customer spend is £50 and parking space turnover is 1 car per hour and you overpark for 2hrs they can demonstrate £100 loss. Therefore a £100 charge for a 2hr overstay in a free car park would be deemed to be reasonable.


Yeah, so it turns out I wasn't taking up a space for someone spending money. I was spending money in said retail park, and not depriving the businesses of income. I also didn't park in a bay I wasn't supposed to - i.e. a disabled space (there's a special kind of hell reserved for dickheads who deprive blue badge holders of somewhere to park, but that's a different debate). Likewise, I didn't overstay my welcome. I parked for about 20 minutes, all told, in a 2-hour stay carpark. 

But carry on with your assumptions.

        No: Cycle wherever I please, it doesn't matter.
        Yes: Can they overtake safely?

            No: Cycle in the middle of the lane.

I try to be kind where possible and will dip into spaces between parked cars to let drivers overtake if they're being patient (drivers revving their engines impatiently do not recieve this courtesy), but if there isn't enough room then I'm going to make damn sure the ""maybe I can just squeeze past him"" thought never crosses their mind, because that's when I have a high chance of being squished.

It's self preservation. Like other road users, you need to assert your presence when cycling. If you let people push you about then you're more likely to get flattened.

Being able to see the last ten years of movement for someone you don't like is extremely useful. Say you have this with mobile phones instead; not only can you see where your target went you can compile lists of everyone they were near. Write some clever algorithms and you can produce relationship maps of who meets who &amp; how often. This is incredibly powerful &amp; dangerous stuff. Has some legit uses, for example with this dataset you could figure out an entire drug distribution network, being able to track the flow of the goods. Or you can use it to monitor political campaigners who stand in the way of your policy. Many would dismiss this as a ""slippery slope"" fallacy but the reality is that we are already at the bottom of that one, with a government that has for decades routinely infiltrated political movements. Giving them such tools is deeply worrisome. 

The records associated with this sort of thing are tiny, a big site like YouTube probably uploads more data in a single second than ANPR would generate in it's entire life! It's often more work to develop an archive process; remember not all ""historic"" data is deleted, some will be retained because it relates to serious crime. It's far easier just to keep it all.

Personally I'm not that bothered that the club hasn't spent any money. After so many windows of throwing around stupid money, often for very little effect, it's refreshing. I think it force their hand into deploying the (in many cases very expensive) assets that they already have on the books and trying to make it work. There are four strikers. Three wingers (if we include Traoré). A variety of midfielders available for attacking and defensive purposes. They're a bit light at the back, and injuries could cause serious problems, but as it stands they can fill every spot with someone suitable. All the ingredients to give it a go are there, although I think there's a definite lack of pure talent for this level of football.

While I'm pleasantly surprised Fernandes kept to his word and kept the purse shut, I was a little surprised that the money from Mutch didn't find a use, and ditto the cash that was up for Borini and Diarra on the summer deadline day. Hopefully that's a sign of financial prudence, but I suppose it could also be unrealistic price tags being shoved the club's faces.

On the negative side, the Zarate situation is just embarassing. Let's hope he isn't the type to hold grudges. It's also a little bit ridiculous that we were chasing Adebayor at the tail end of deadline day, when it's a position that has required strengthening since JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN.

Since the biggest gain for animal welfare would be to stop farming them on an industrial scale in the first place, I accept that what is realistic is targeting the biggest gains for animal welfare which are also cheap and easy for agribusiness to do.

So I wouldn't say you shouldn't make a complaint, but I would say you are ethically obliged to complain longest and loudest about the most inhumane things about the industrial farming protest, rather than limiting your complaining to this one particular issue which (I'm sure coincidentally) happens to impact disproportionately on Muslims.

To use your analogy (which I think is a good one), you would be well advised to pay off debt with the highest rate of interest first, whether that debt is large or small. In the same way we should address the many absolutely unquestionable improvements to animal welfare which are cheaper, will affect more animals and to which there is no possible stigma attached that you might just be using it as a Trojan Horse to attack Muslims. For example, you might want to [support making CCTV mandatory](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/64997) in slaughterhouses to prevent this kind of abuse happening again. If we only have a limited amount of political energy for this sort of animal rights project, I would hate to see it wasted on a completely marginal issue like halal slaughter.

There are plenty of practices which harm animals which are probably less harmful than non-stun halal slaughter (such as not giving pigs - who are very clever - enough to do during the day), so when we address the issues which are much *more* harmful I will be first in line to campaign against halal slaughter.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"Yes, but as I say, it's subjective. Does the judiciary consider that the biometrics of someone who ""assisted Police with their enquiries"" but was found to be *utterly innocent and uninvolved* are an appropriate piece of data to retain - is it in the interest of crime prevention to retain the data of a person has been neither convicted nor even charged with any crime?

This is in stark contrast to someone who has been convicted of a crime and is at risk of re-offending, where the retention of biometric data may be of genuine use further down the line.

Also, one can argue as to how long data should be retained for convicted criminals. Retaining the photo of someone who was convicted of shoplifting at 20 but who went on to live a law-abiding life is not actually helpful after about 15 years since their appearance will probably have changed. Fingerprints and DNA don't change much, but faces can.

**The key point**

The key point is whether the Police are trying to assemble a database that - if they asked for it directly - they would be denied the authority to assemble.

If the Police said to the government:

&gt; ""We want a mandatory ID card scheme. All individuals born or living in Britain will have DNA, Iris and fingerprint samples collected at birth or point of entry, with a lawful requirement to submit a current photograph every 10 years"".

They would be laughed out, they would be told to *get lost* in the strongest possible terms.

But that's basically what they're trying to assemble - scrape all the data - even if a person is not guilty or even charged with something, we'll hang onto it.

That's very much more iffy. It's trying to record the biometrics of everyone who has ever had contact with the Police ever, for anything - however minor. Even if they were mistakenly arrested and de-arrested 5 hours later, they're in the system for life. Is that right? Not convinced.

It's not collecting data on someone who is un-convicted, but *suspected* of planning a crime or act of terrorism. It's not part of an *ongoing investigation*. It's retaining data on *entirely innocent* individuals who happen to own a building that a murder victim lived in, or happened to be passing through the area at the time.

**Police abuse powers. Shock horror.**

It's subjective, there are lots of reasons people can be in the system - convictions, subject of genuine investigations, or involved in an investigation but not with any criminal involvement. Some of those might genuinely involve the collection of data, which the average man on the street would not consider ethical to *retain* if that person is excluded from the investigation. It's judging the point - on a case by case basis - where s29 ceases to apply.

I don't honestly think that ""we keep everything because it might potentially be useful somewhere down the line"" is a valid response to s29. In fact it renders the checks and balances of the Act fairly worthless - it gives the Police carte blanche to do what they like if they play the ""prevention of crime"" card, and the Police should **NEVER** have carte blanche over anything.

The Police must **ALWAYS** be subject to checks, balances and oversight. Because we allow them to walk the streets with offensive weapons and section 5 firearms. We allow them to deprive individuals of their liberty and even use lethal force if necessary. In the name of law and order yes. But they are not the law, they merely enforce it. Checks and balances are always necessary to ensure they do not overstep some laws in their enthusiasm to enforce others.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"I think you're really making three points here. The first is a completely unnessecary personal attack on my vegetarian beliefs, which I hope we can chalk up to raised tempers on both sides. I *would* rather everyone were a vegetarian, but I'm not going to try and force my beliefs down anyone's throat. However I *will* force my belief that animals should be treated with dignity down the throat of anyone who disagrees, loudly and repeatedly if nescessary. I don't think you disagree that animals should be treated with dignity, so I think the attack on my vegetarianism was unfounded and unkind.

The second is that your concerns about food hygene are separate from your concerns about animal welfare. I can see how that could be possible, but I don't understand how your comment follows from mine earlier; I'm saying that asking whether meat is halal because of concerns about animal welfare is not a good strategy for avoiding meat which has been treated badly, or acquiring meat which has been treated well. But you seem to be saying that halal meat is bad *per se* because someone has said a prayer over the animal before killing it, which constitutes 'mucking about' with your food. Which I guess is a coherant position, but I don't see how the one is related to the other.

The third is that you worked in a slaughterhouse and never saw anything like this. Which is excellent, obviously. However activist groups like Animal Aid are *constantly* uncovering evidence of this sort of behaviour, suggesting that at least some slaughterhouses currently operating in the UK are getting away with it. I hope you'd agree with me that it isn't right that slaughterhouses which abuse animals like this be allowed to operate, even if we also accept slaughterhouses generally need to do unpleasant things to animals in order to turn them from living creatures into food - what occured in this slaughterhouse is beyond the pale, and it is beyond the pale because of the welfare abuse of animals, not because the slaughterhouse itself is nominally halal.",null,0,null,1422972624,null,0,false,0,co9sji3,null,t3_2um5ej,null,t1_co9sji3,null,t1_co9s9du,null,null,null,1424237675,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

That's why it's controversial, because a pro monarchist PM has acted against all advice, ignored his cabinet and reintroduced something no one asked for and then has used it to increase his standing with the monarchy.

The risk of false positives is just too great: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/may/25/dna-database-false-positive) and then there's the fact that people misunderstand DNA evidence and the fact that it's not just a black and white issue (you have to take into account lab errors, similarities in siblings, etc): http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun07/problem.aspx

""If you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear"" is just bullshit. I don't trust the police to administer this 100% effectively.

It also creates two tiers of innocent people - those who have been arrested and released without charge, and those who have never been arrested. The first have to live with the possibility of being matched by a false positive. Granted - the error may be caught before they spend 20 years in prison, but perhaps not before they are arrested again and spend another night in a cell. The latter don't have to worry about that. The fact is that *nobody* should have to worry about that if they are innocent, which is why it's an incredibly bad idea to keep *any* details of innocents on file - photos, DNA, fingerprints, whatever.

&gt;It's trying to record the biometrics of everyone who has ever had contact with the Police ever, for anything - however minor.

No, just those who've been arrested for a recordable offence (so reasonable grounds exist to suspect their involvement in the commission of an offence). That's a long way from photographing anyone who comes anywhere near a police station.

&gt;It's subjective, there are lots of reasons people can be in the system - convictions, subject of genuine investigations, or involved in an investigation but not with any criminal involvement.

It's not really subjective at all. The photographs are taken after arrest, so S24 and code G of PACE apply.


&gt;The Police must ALWAYS be subject to checks, balances and oversight.

Nobody's saying they shouldn't. But the Government has granted the police an exemption to the DPA, and they're using that exemption. How is that a surprise? Nothing has changed - the only difference is that they're now using the data pro-actively rather than reactively.

Nobody minded the retention of mugshots until they actually became useful.

If you place the police under the same restrictions as any other company, you hobble their ability to actually do their job because (believe it or not) criminals have a tendency to not operate in plain sight and so the ability to do things like comparing CCTV images or fingerprints with those on file from people who've been arrested is essential to actually catching those criminals.

null,false,BorisBoris88,null,null,null,"I'm afraid you're going to have to do a little leg work, as there will be differences between what individual firms offer.

Start by going to Rightmove.com and putting in the postcode of the property that is to be sold, with a search radius of 3 miles.  This will show you what else is for sale nearby, and homes that have been recently sold.  Have a look through the list of properties and see if there are any particular firms that appear time and again.  In an ideal world try to find three firms that are dealing with similar properties to the one you hope to sell.  

Telephone each of them and ask them to meet with you at the property to provide a valuation.  Valuing a property is far more art than science, so expect a bit of a range of prices, but ask them to demonstrate how they came up with their figure, ideally by showing you details of similar homes that they have recently sold.  Then you want to find out what they will charge you for selling, which in most cases will be as a % of the eventual sale price, and this will almost certainly have VAT on top.  Finding an agent to give you the lowest possible fee % isn't necessarily the best idea, as you'll want a decent negotiator to act on your behalf when it comes to agreeing a sale.  As with so many thinks in life, cheapest isn't always the best.  Not easy when it comes to estate agents, but think about which one you'd like to work with, as the chances are the whole process will take a few months, and it'll be easier if it's someone you trust to act on your behalf.

It isn't always the best strategy to go for the highest valuation, as some agents will 'bribe' you into instructing them by giving an unrealistically high valuation, and the property may not sell. That's why it's a good idea to get three valuations, and make sure the agents know you're having three, which should keep them on their toes.

The vast majority of estate agents work on a 'no-sale, no-fee' basis, which means that if they don't find you a buyer at a level you're happy with you don't pay them anything.  Don't pay any money upfront, and make sure things like brochures, floorplans, EPCs and advertisements are included in their fee.

Hope that helps.

Depending on your pension provider, you can manage the funds yourself, or sit back and let them make the choice for you.

It *might* be worth paying more than the matched amount in, but I'm guessing you want to save for a car, house deposit, or similar?

I do. I found it interesting to learn exactly what a knighthood is and how it works within the constitution.

In 1981 the same award was given to Prince Charles. They had to [amend the constitution](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010Q00036) to achieve it. I can't remember back that far to know if that was also controversial.

Abbott had the right to appoint Philip as a knight, whether he *should* have is another matter. Give him enough rope and he'll see himself out fairly quickly.

There are &gt;6600 Police Officers (~5%) authorised to carry Glock 17s in public, along with HK MP5s, G36s and a variety of other rifles and sub-machine guns depending on their force area. Talking about all Police as an entity, not just regular beat bobbies. As an entity, ""the Police"" do indeed go about with S.5 firearms. Just take a stroll around Westminster or any UK airport.

And any regular joe carrying a CS can, ASP baton or taser in public would be in under offensive weapon charges. Mere possession of CS and tasers is illegal. Batons or blunt instruments, not without reasonable excuse.

&gt; It's not really subjective at all. The photographs are taken after arrest, so S24 and code G of PACE apply.

Their collection is not subjective. The length of time for which such data should be retained is. At what point should someone drop out the system?

I'm not arguing that the Police have the right to collect this data, but your references to PACE are utterly irrelevant to the argument I was making. I'm not talking *collection*, I'm talking *retention*. S.24, Code G of PACE - they're about how an arrest is conducted and a prisoner processed. Not the conditions under which data collected during that arrest should be retained.

Yes, someone is arrested, they are processed, that data is collected.

For someone like Christopher Jeffries, the record of his arrest and interviews will of course remain as part of the case file, but few would consider there to be any serious reason to retain biometrics beyond the woolliest ""Well, they're in now, might as well keep them in case it *is* him the next time one of his tenants is murdered"".

Which is clearly bollocks.


The courts (who have a reasonable view of how policing is conducted, when evidence is admissible/inadmissible, etc) have ruled that indefinite retention goes beyond the powers that DPA grants the Police.

THE COURTS have said that indiscriminately keeping all data indefinitely is indefensible, and have agreed with certain complainants that their data should be deleted. But the Police have fought, and dragged their heels in the face of court orders. I find that worrying that elements of the Police consider themselves above the court system.

It may be that they are able to make an ongoing justification for holding onto data for convicted criminals or individuals of interest under investigation, but that *does not* mean they can make such a claim for *all* the data they hold.

&gt; Nobody's saying they shouldn't.

Well there's the problem - the Biometrics Commissioner has oversight of DNA and Fingerprints. Right now, facial recognition tech does not come under that remit. So clearly if the Police are now moving into using these systems, then the checks and balances need to be updated to ensure that the people who are supposed to have oversight of it actually have to power to hold the Police to account if they overstep their authority. Which they regularly do. GCHQ aren't supposed to indiscriminately collect everybody's data but it's become apparent that they have done so, or got the NSA to do it and in return collected data on Americans to trade with them in order to circumvent the checks and balances regarding spying on their own citizens.


&gt; But the Government has granted the police an exemption to the DPA, and they're using that exemption.

Using? or ABusing?

The government said the Police could refuse various DPA requests where a DPA release may prejudice an investigation. The Police DO NOT have a carte-blanche exemption. They are still required to abide by the DPA principles such as not retaining data for any longer than necessary.

In the case of a murderer or prolific burglar who reoffends every time they are released, the case for retaining their data for prevention/detection is very easy to make.

For people like Chris Jeffries it is very difficult to make. PACE is not relevant to that discussion, and does not make the case for the indiscriminate and indefinite retention of all data collected ever.",null,0,null,1422975905,null,0,1422979563,0,co9tz1c,null,t3_2ulyru,null,t1_co9tz1c,null,t1_co9t8id,null,null,null,1424236947,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Balotelli was signed as a last-minute attempt at getting a marquee signing. We knew it was a gamble. He never had a 'role' to fulfil at the club and we all knew he would take time to adapt to the team or, otherwise, the team would need to adapt to him. The latter hasn't happened at all and the former hasn't happened *yet*. 

Lovren was scouted extensively and hand-picked to fill a specific Carragher-sized hole in our (then) back four. He was signed as our commanding centre back, as someone who should hit the ground running and who shouldn't have any problems adapting. 

In other words, the level of expectations was justifiably different. 

I think many of us can agree that when he played him, Rodgers tried to crowbar Balotelli into a role he has never played before. I personally think he did well, all things considered. Lovren was meant to be a natural and that is why his transfer fee was what it was. If Lovren cost 10 million pounds, the criticism would have been substantially less harsh. 

Therefore, I don't think one can argue that Balotelli as a player cost us games: if you buy a lion, call it 'Mittens' and try to make it purr by stroking it, you can't criticise it for biting your arm off - that's what lions do when you stroke them and they have always done so. However, if you go to a cat store, buy what looks like and has always behaved like a cat and it starts barking and eats three of your children, then I think you're within your rights to feel some animosity towards this 'cat'. 

Having said all that, Lovren is what he is and that is not what we were buying. He can still become a good centre back. He just hasn't been and I believe that criticism of him is far more justified than that of Balotelli.

It never fucking is about fucking Brendan Rodgers. The eternally faultless manager. How difficult is it to grasp that he is a vital cog in this transfer fuckwittery. I am not placing the blame squarely on him, but you seem adamant that he can do no wrong.

&gt; not 'ready made' at all

No sure, Suarez was cleaning plates at Salto the year before joining us. Daniel was mowing lawns in south London and Coutinho was playing 5-a-side on the Copacabana. Discredit Damien Commolli all we may, but the fucker was single handedly better than any of the current circus of a committee combined. 

&gt;  Sometimes these clubs pull it off, but they never can stay strong for long, because they don't have the money to sustain quality

Yeah well, you see, they just about have their transfer business organized. You can be sure they will pick up excellent to very good players regularly and have that conveyer belt on which if not Torres, then Aguero, if not Aguero then Diego, if not Diego then Mandzukic etc. You see what I'm saying? Probably not. 

Now, let me tell you about Dotmund. Dortmund, you say picked up 'young' 'non readymade' players. They developed at the club. They also, like, you know, won some silverware along the way. Then they left. All the best players one by one. And then Dortmund collapsed. You see where this is going? Dortmund have become a selling feeder club to Hollywood FC, and they suffer now. However amid all this chaos, they pick up players like Aubemyang. We? 

We sell our best players. We Take that money to the market and buy? Ricky Lambert. Mario Ballotelli. Dejan fucking Lovren. Jesus wept. 120 million, a once in a decade chance at LFC and what do we do? 

Yes, Ricky Lambert. I think it's not Lambert on his own, but he is symptomatic of everything wrong with this clubs transfer clusterfuckery.

I still kind of held on to him as a ""good player"" in my mind from my first year as a Spurs fan.

But with all that I've seen this season, I have no reason to doubt Poch and his plan and his direction for the team. If he thinks Lennon wasn't in his plans, then I guess we'll have to do without it.

You will find on all comparison sites that if you select you have had a claim there is an entry for ""Windscreen, NCB not affected"" which covers things like stone chip repairs. 99.9999% of the time this will not make any difference whatsoever to a renewal quote.

Your renewal quotes of £700 aren't because you had two stone chip claims, they're because you've had a policy cancelled by the insurer.

&gt;Lovren was scouted extensively and hand-picked to fill a specific Carragher-sized hole

Yes I agree with that and it's correct. But has Lovren actually had a chance in the team with a proper defensive midfielder infront of him? The only time Lovrens played has been with Gerrard sat infront, that means he gets less protection and as a result his performances are going to be worse. Look at Skrtel now, this month he has looked absolutely brilliant but at the start of the season he was very average. I put this down to having more protection from the midfield and the team playing with a better formation.

&gt;therefore, I don't think one can argue that Balotelli as a player cost us games

Disagree, what about the Everton game when he missed that sitter? They then went on to score and we dropped two points. Plus there have been many results when he has come on or started and looked very poor. Also Lovren being a CB is going to highlight his mistakes more, Balotelli has made as much mistakes but they aren't as costly because he is a striker.

&gt; He never had a 'role' to fulfil at the club and we all knew he would take time to adapt to the team or, otherwise, the team would need to adapt to him. The latter hasn't happened at all and the former hasn't happened ye

This is another thing I don't get. Why is Balotelli allowed to 'adapt' to the team but Lovren has to come in and start playing perfectly straight away? Markovic didn't start brilliantly but he was scouted extensively like you mentioned about Lovren. Now Markovic is playing great and is a big part of the team.

&gt;Rodgers tried to crowbar Balotelli into a role he has never played before. I personally think he did well, all things considered

What role was that? Rodgers tried many different formations to fit Balotelli in. We played with Sterling next to him, Mario on his own, Mario in the 3-4-3 formation. None of the formations he has looked brilliant.

His 1974 book Cruthin, garnered controversy for its claims that the ancient Cruthin were a pre-Gaelic people who were driven from Ireland to Scotland and that their modern descendants are the Ulster Scots Protestants who merely returned to their old homeland during the 17th-century Plantation of Ulster. Few historians accept his interpretations, with some accusing him of creating a sectarian narrative in which northern Protestants have a prior to claim to Ireland.

At the point it becomes clear the government will be unable to pay it back (But long before then, the cost of borrowing will become utterly crippling and the government ends up spending more on debt servicing than anything else).

&gt; What would a shortage of pounds look it?

Its not about a shortage of pounds, its about a devaluation of the currency. You cant just make yourself richer by printing out loads of bank notes. Ask Robert Mugabe. That's why government borrowing has to be underpinned by the promise of repayment with interest.

Borrowing money is effectively mortgaging your future. You get the money today but your labour is indentured to the value of the loan and its interest until its paid off.

The next 4 months are going to be huge for QPR. 

It's a shame because Harry will only be remembered for the record breaking away run now, and I can't see him managing anywhere else. I think he's fixed 75% of the issues Hughes left us with, the next manager will have an easier time.

&gt;“We played Southampton [in November 2012] and lost [leaving the club with four points from 12 games]. Reluctantly we decided to let Mark [Hughes] go. It was a very painful decision. I called Harry up on his mobile. He was not surprised. He was expecting my call.”

Inevitably, he bleeds the club with ridiculous big name signings generating a team with no plan or identity:
[QPR debt rises to £177m after reporting £65.4m loss last season](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/06/qpr-debt-177m-report-premier-league-relegation)

Redknapp:
&gt; [""I don't really want to see the owners have their pants taken down like they have in the past.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20828024)

But without batting an eyelid:
&gt; ['If you are cut adrift at Christmas, you don't want to be going and getting yourself into trouble, but if we are still in there with a chance, which I think we will be, then the chairman will go out and let us get one or two players who could make the difference for us.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2840953/QPR-looking-sign-one-two-players-January-admits-Harry-Redknapp.html)

This worthless scrote has abused so many kind-hearted chairmen, most of all Fernandes. He's like a little child, Fernandes. He clearly loves the game and wants to give everything he can to someone who he trusts blindly to make it work. And now, looking on the fucking ruinous mess he has made of the club, he walks away feigning a fucking limp. There is absolutely no fucking way that what is almost certainly going to turn out to be an elective knee operation for arthritis stops someone from managing a fucking football club (use a wheelchair if you have to, which you don't), and certainly not at such ridiculously short notice, AFTER the fucking January window where his successor might have had a fucking chance to buy and sell their way to a workable squad. It's a shame he hasn't apologised for leaving the club in a fucking hole, but it's more of a shame that a few short months from now, he'll be sticking the knife in anyone else he can at that club to blame them and wash his hands of what he's done. Taarabt, maybe. He's a good option.

Redknapp destroyed West Ham (silver linings I guess), he destroyed Portsmouth, he destroyed Southampton, then he went back and made sure Portsmouth were definitely dead. He was going to do the same to Spurs in the end as he has to QPR. And he will walk away to his fucking mansion on the beach and lie in his bed of cash, wanking himself to sleep over how Spurs would have won the league if Levy had bought Huntelaar for £150m while the media stick their tongue up his arse and tell him it tastes like sugar.

1. Yes, but with the numbers involved and the fact they can just create new accounts and do the same, it's pointless. Twitter support are notoriously useless, and only posts than gain a serious amount of media attention/reports are actually dealt with.

1. Again with blocking, new accounts just pop up.

1. Police don't really do anything with stuff like this unless there's been physical harms or media attention etc, because it's seriously time consuming and other serious investigations take priority. New laws have been proposed (not sure if they affect NI) to put more effort/resources behind investigating online trolls, but currently the laws that cover it are not often enforced due to the nature of the crime (lots of people doing 1 or 2 trolls as opposed to one person doing lots if trolling)

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"&gt; But has Lovren actually had a chance in the team with a proper defensive midfielder infront of him? The only time Lovrens played has been with Gerrard sat infront, that means he gets less protection and as a result his performances are going to be worse. 

We played with Gerrard as DM last season and did not experience as many problems. But that is besides the point: I do not think Lovren's mistakes stem from a lack of protection. A lack of protection gives you numerical disadvantages, players running past you etc. Lovren's mistakes are basic defensive errors: poor marking, lack of anticipation, wrong placement of the defensive line. Poor set pieces is another one: how is that dependent on where your DM is? 

&gt; Look at Skrtel now, this month he has looked absolutely brilliant but at the start of the season he was very average. I put this down to having more protection from the midfield and the team playing with a better formation.

Devil's advocate argument: or could it also be because there is more confidence and faith in our defensive game, stemming from the greatest liability being taken out? Leaving the devil aside, a change in formation and the addition of Lucas have been beneficial, but, as above, Lovren's mistakes tend to be down to individual errors, not faulty tactics. I'm not convinced this would have changed in a back three with Lucas in front of them - perhaps only by others covering for him, but that does not excuse errors. 

&gt; Disagree, what about the Everton game when he missed that sitter? They then went on to score and we dropped two points. Plus there have been many results when he has come on or started and looked very poor.

Right, and now imagine if I went back through all our games from August to December and picked out individual Lovren errors that have led to goals. Missed Balotelli sitters versus Lovren errors: which one would come out on top? 

Not even going into a debate about why comparing missed sitters and defensive errors is a nonsensical path to take. 

&gt; This is another thing I don't get. Why is Balotelli allowed to 'adapt' to the team but Lovren has to come in and start playing perfectly straight away? 

Because that is specifically why Lovren was signed - that is how his transfer fee was justified by the club at the time. From day one, Rodgers said Balotelli would need to adapt. Lovren was sold to us as a 'plug and play' solution. 

&gt; What role was that? Rodgers tried many different formations to fit Balotelli in. We played with Sterling next to him, Mario on his own, Mario in the 3-4-3 formation. None of the formations he has looked brilliant. The only game where he has looked decent was against Spurs, but that was his debut and he got replaced after 60 mins.

That's slightly disingenuous, I feel. He generally was asked to play up front by himself and make runs into the box, replicating Sturridge, and adopt a high pressing game, neither of which are his strong points. But even then, his work rate has been very good every time I have seen him play live. It was his decision-making in this role that let him down. A handful of games with a makeshift winger-cum-striker also isn't a solid argument against Balotelli's ability to play in a strike partnership. 

I am much more willing to forgive mistakes in a player who is asked to play in a new role and is showing desire than in one who is making basic mistakes in a role and a style he has played most of his career in. 

Having said that, as I said, Lovren is not what we bought him as, that much is clear. But that does not mean he cannot become a good centre back for us. Still, I do not think it is accurate to portray the Balotelli and Lovren situations as similar: expectations, transfer fees and the utilisations of these two are very different.

I haven't lived incredibly frugally, and I've never once felt like I didn't have enough money to get by, and I never got a penny off my parents to pay for anything. 

My dad is the one whose income the loan is based off, and while he doesn't earn vast amounts of money, his income is above average. As such, I got a lower amount of money than a lot of people. Some people (especially people whose parents lived in London,  I found) studying outside of London really struggled when they got the minimum maintenance loan and yet their parents didn't have the disposable income to help. 

I think the main issue is that the minimum loan is much too low, and the maximum is too high (I have a friend who when he combines his loan, grant and bursary from the university gets somewhere in the region of £9000 a year, plus a £2000 a year fee waiver). 

The other is issue is simply that people seem to expect that they can have the same quality of life they were used to at home.

Add in assets like Otamendi, Parejo and Feghouli and you've got a team he could slot in for and play champions league football with consistently. Pains me to say it but I don't think he'll have any trouble getting a deal at a bigger club. Other places could be somewhere in France like Lyon/Marseille with their recent success this season or perhaps Italy, maybe even Dortmund if it looks likely they'll qualify next season. Reus' absence will surely leave a spot?

Varane depends more on whether Real would be willing to sell (and in turn, whether Varane pushes for it). If they will sell, then the price is not likely to be insurmountable (probably ~£25-£30m).

Pogba on the other hand will be a massive transfer fee. It's clear he's likely to leave Juve in the summer, but his fee is likely to be around 100 million euro.

Hello! And I hope you enjoy your time in Edinburgh (don't let these meanies put you off).
So basically, Edinburgh is colder than Florida. A LOT colder. So come with a coat and a few sweaters!
It is an absolutely beautiful city, steeped in history, with numerous landmark buildings and areas to visit - Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh Castle, etc stuff you have no doubt seen from Google but cool to visit all the same. I moved here from another part of Scotland 3 years ago, and Edinburgh's beauty still takes my breath away :)
Flat living - can be noisy, can be hard to adjust to if you're not used to it. I have lived in flats for the past 12 years, it's fine. Earplugs are sometimes a necessity. 
Music scene is good here! Glasgow is equally cool, and about an hour away, so you will never be stuck for gigs etc. Clubs are a fair mix to be honest. You can pretty much get whatever type of club you are looking for in Edinburgh, with again Glasgow being close on hand for alternatives. There are TONS of nice bars in Edinburgh (nice is totally subjective mind you, but I haven't been disappointed).

Zimbabwe is completely irrelevant to this discussion. Zimbabwe owed a heap of *USD*, a currency they do not issue, and they ran into massive strife with it. This form of borrowing has more in common with your household than with the UK government - your household could try printing ""jonewer"" bucks to pay back GBP denominated credit card debt, but it won't do you any more good than printing ZWD to pay back USD denominated debts did Zimbabwe.

Essentially, in trying to pay back foreign denominated debt by printing domestic, the government's buying up the supply curve of USD on fx markets, tanking the currency in value. Rest is history. This bears *zero* resemblance to quantitative easing, which is a currency-issuer buying up domestically denominated bonds with domestic currency, and is quite non-inflationary.

&gt; Borrowing money is effectively mortgaging your future.

Rubbish.

When the UK government pays UK citizens more pounds than it taxes, three things happen:

1. It increases the savings of the UK private sector. Savings that *are passed on to the next generation*. Every year the non-govt (ie us) pays less in taxes than it receives from the govt, the non-govt *has more financial savings*. The government's debt is quite literally the non-government's savings. 

2. It creates more jobs. When the govt taxes too highly for its given level of expenditure, opportunities dry up. When it taxes appropriately - and this appropriate amount may well be less than its expenditure - the nation can be fully employed. *These are opportunities that the next generation - the youth of today - will benefit from.*

3. In us being fully employed, we get to create more things. We build and maintain more infrastructure. We generate knowledge by researching new techs, by developing skills, etc etc. This all pays back dividends going into the future.

You're so obsessed with the fact that the government will pass down to the next *government* owings in GBP to completely miss the other side of the accounting ledger. That the non-govt is passing down GBP denominated *savings* to the next generation, and all the good things that come with that.

Instead, today, we're trying to do the asinine thing of having the government *save pounds* at the expense of the private sector. Cameron and his cronies are intent on taxing UK citizens more than it pays them, forcing them to dissave pounds. *People don't want* to dissave pounds right now, which is leading to subdued spending and an economy [miles from trend growth](https://i.imgur.com/7Pg67Sj.png). *This is all entirely self-inflicted pain*.

&gt; You get the money today but your labour is indentured to the value of the loan and its interest until its paid off.

Know who the government pays interest? The *non-government*. That's us!

Know how much interest the government pays? However much the central bank wants it to pay. The govt's assured the risk-free rate, the central bank sets the risk-free rate, hence the government, through the CB, is setting its own rates on debt. Can you imagine if you could do that? If you could set both your own credit limit *and* interest rates on that debt? Why, the government, as issuer of the pound, *does*. And yet today, despite that, we're told it must rein in its spending.. and we're killing the economy in trying to force it to do so.

Those who are so adverse to these that they'd rather not claim, then fall into the 'not seeking work' part of the definition and are again removed from the pool of unemployed counted for statistical use.

null,false,TheViagraKid,null,null,null,"I have 2 anecdotes which contradict this...

1. My mother - she's ""self employed"", earns about £15,000 a year but pays 0 tax after all the allowances and such she can deduct. She also has my father's substantial income...we're definitely not in poverty.

2. My old boss at a tutoring franchise was also ""self employed"". I got bored at work a lot and so decided to calculate how much she must earn. She charged £60 per month per kid per subject (which is insane imo, there's absolutely no use to that kind of thing if you ask me, if I was a kid I would've hated it). There were a good 100 kids. Id say about 80% did both English and maths. The rest did just one or the other. So she was making about £130,000+ gross profit per year. Everyone paid cash or cheque and then us employees were paid in cash. There were on average 4 of us, £5/hour (below minimum wage for a couple of the older staff, which again, was dodgy) for the 12 hours she ran the franchise per week. Total staff costs for the year were roughly £12,000, although it may have been higher as I only worked 2 of the 3 days she ran it, I don't know staffing levels on the other day. The only unknown I had was her costs for renting the room we used. But I believe it was probably around £200/week (it was just a back room with a few chairs and tables at a local sports club), so about £8,000 when holidays are taken into account. By my calculations she was *easily* breaking £100,000 net profit. 

Even if my memory fails me, because looking back that seems incredibly lucrative, and it was actually £60/term (more reasonable but tbh possibly on the cheap side at that point), she's still making £25,000+/year untaxed. Which, on a taxes income, would be £35,000+, decently above the national average...and she only worked 3 days a week. 

I'm sure there are some hard working self employed people who don't make much. But there are just as many who make a shit ton and either play the system so it appears they don't make much, or simply don't use the system at all like my (former) boss.

Hard to say without knowing what your cash flow is like.  Depends on where you live etc Because you need to determine the cost of living. 

For example in currently on about 19k pa salary.  It's a job i had to take due to financial circumstances however im due to start another job soon and I'm currently going security checks which take 2 or 3 months (i work in IT security).

For a rough breakdown of costs:

Rent £325 pm (shared with my gf whos at uni)

Travel to work £300 pm (yes it's insane but i had no choice but to take the job at the time)

Council tax £100ish pm

Food £30pw

Phone/Internet £50pm

Bills etc £50pm

Overall I'm left with about £200 spending money which tbh fucking sucks but with my new job I'll have about £1000pm to play with after I've taken my expenses out. I did drive and have a car previously but i had to sell it due to it not being economically viable.  

The £30pw shop does both me and my gf, breakfast lunch and dinner for a week. We eat well,  I'm a good cook (was actually a chef previously) and its mostly fresh stuff. Being able to add up the entire shopping total in my head is a godsend when walking around asda

 I just don't spend money on shit.  Last month my ""luxuries"" were £2.60 on a coffee on payday. £4 on my steam account and £8 on a cuddly toy for the gf. I have neither the want or means to buy things i don't need so i just don't.

&gt; (which by and large in my opinion is shit)

Lots of modern art is fucking great; much of the rest lacks merit in some way or other but least shows effort and thought. But I have no time for the charlatans and snake oil salesmen who indulge in bullshit explanations of conceptual art as if it's anything more than fucking obvious horse feathers. Art differentiates us from the animals; art criticism (in its modern and conceptual up its own arse forms) wilfully fails to differentiate even between  varieties of turd.

null,false,MrSqueegee95,lfc68,,null,"&gt;We played with Gerrard as DM last season and did not experience as many problems. 

I disagree with that completely. Last season we were one of the worst defensive teams in the league, over the last month we have had the best defensive record in the league. This happens as soon as we take Gerrard out of DM and move him forward, and then replace him with Lucas.

&gt;Lovren's mistakes are basic defensive errors: poor marking, lack of anticipation, wrong placement of the defensive line. Poor set pieces is another one: how is that dependent on where your DM is?

He makes mistakes but so did Skrtel when he was playing with Gerrard infront, now he looks solid and doesn't make mistakes. The reason Lovren makes most of these mistakes is due to a lack of protection. Every defender makes a mistake now and again, but if you have a DM who can clean up and pick up on those mistakes then you are going to concede less. Gerrard isn't a DM, he doesn't read danger like Lucas, Lovren suffered as a result of that. Just look at him for Southampton, he had two defensive midfielders infront of him and he rarely put a foot wrong, it's a big transition coming from that to just Gerrard.

&gt;Devil's advocate argument: or could it also be because there is more confidence and faith in our defensive game, stemming from the greatest liability being taken out?

Yes the biggest defensive liability being Gerrard.

&gt;That's slightly disingenuous, I feel. He generally was asked to play up front by himself and make runs into the box, replicating Sturridge, and adopt a high pressing game, neither of which are his strong points. But even then, his work rate has been very good every time I have seen him play live. It was his decision-making in this role that let him down. A handful of games with a makeshift winger-cum-striker also isn't a solid argument against Balotelli's ability to play in a strike partnership.

See this is the thing, Balotelli should be doing this already because he is a striker. What strikers do you know that don't make any runs in the box and don't work hard in a lone system? The only other striker I know is Berbatov but even he made runs into the box and was clever enough to know when to make runs, plus his technical ability was streets ahead of Mario's.

Got to be honest I don't think Balotelli will succeed here, he hasn't progressed at all since he was an 18 year old at Inter. I like Mario and he seems to be trying, but I don't think it's enough. The difference between Lovren and Balotelli is that Lovren's mistakes are easier to fix, like Carragher said it can be done with a few hours on the training groud. But Balotelli not having the instincts when to press, when to make a run in behind the defender and having a complete lack of awareness is much more worrying and I don't think we will ever see him put those right.",null,0,null,1422980772,null,0,false,0,co9wixg,null,t3_2umwd6,null,t1_co9wixg,null,t1_co9v9bb,null,null,null,1424235756,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

And again, like I said, Kevin is an extremely hard working player. Every team and coach he has trained with have only had wonderful things to say about him and it shows on the pitch. So I really have a hard time imaging he wasn't training hard enough. 

In fact, I find that claim pretty ridiculous. No matter what level of training you are at, whether a professional footballer, or just your average joe lifting weights at the gym, they all understand that you must constantly push yourself or else you can't get better at what you are doing. Not training your hardest is only hurting yourself as a player, that is why regardless of how shitty of an attitude a player has they all train extremely hard, because they want to be the best they can. Its one of the bare and utmost basic fundamentals of being a player.

I'll ask you only one thing below..

&gt; You might not like it, but practically every other successful club is doing this in some measure.

You are clearly sweeping under the rug this bit:

All those clubs WIN things. Lyon, Porto, Borrusia, Madrid, Athletico, Benfica etc. All of them have won silverware while we shove our fingers deeper into our collective asses at the LFC transfer circus. And with men who are full of themselves, I can only see it getting worse. 

So what you;re essentially saying is we are just fine not winning things and being run like a selling club....brilliant. 

From your posts I'm just getting one thing. That you seem to be satisfied that we can balance the books and be a feeder and selling club. 

&gt;  if Chelsea had been the only big club in the league, Liverpool would have won titles.

Erm, no. Because last year, Liverpool FC was brought don by its greatest enemy, Liverppol FC. We dont know how to get over that winning line. Different topic for another day. 

&gt; The Transfer Price Index book and Soccernomics are both easy enough to read, and it will change the way you look at football, because there's no arguing with maths.

Thank you. I'd rather watch football and not go around the moon to reach the sun. 

&gt; And no, it's not about Brendan

Thanks for reinforcing my view about your, and many others on heres attitude towards Rodgers. It's blind faith like nothing else. 

&gt; What the club doesn't need is fans who are unhappy with the truth of it demanding careless, reckless behaviour, like buying expensive, ready-made players.

What the club needs maybe, in an armachair fans opinion over the interwebs, is less deluded people who think buying one match winner is equivalent to City or Chelsea level of shopping. What the club needs is less accountants and more football people. What the club needs is an overhaul of the transfer bufoonery going on since the last 2 decades almost. 

And most importantly,what supporters need to realize is it is idiotic to want to run a club like a business and think that titles are won by a bunch of kids all over the pitch.

People who operate through a limited company or umbrella company don't generally self-identify as ""self-employed"" even if they're the only person in their company. 

If you're generate meaningful revenue then it's much more tax efficient to operate as a limited company, meaning that self-employed people who do well tend to become companies. So the data set used is essentially skewed towards people who aren't making much money.

This data also doesn't separate full-time from part-time work, it's crazy to treat a freelancers who does a few hours a week or someone who makes some money on etsy on the side as the same as a full-time employee.

null,false,mittencloth,null,null,null,"**For eating:**
Fusco's are known as the best fish and chips in the town and have a couple of restaurants, or try Robertson's if you're after veggie friendly / gluten free of the same. 

The Magpie is famous and draws queues all year round, it's a good restaurant but I think Fuscos compares as far as fish and chips are concerned. 

Humble Pie n Mash on Church street serves wartime style pie dinners in enamel dishes by an open fire - it gets busy but worth a short queue if there is one, the theming is great and the food is lovely on a cold day. 

Other than that the place is littered with nice cafes and restaurants, an American style diner, and pub grub, so you'll have no trouble finding places. 

**Drink:**
Pretty much all of the pubs in the centre are decent, but if you want to go a bit more loud music / jagerbomb route then hit the Shambles - a large bar with balcony overlooking the harbour. There does exist 1 nightclub and 1 Wetherspoons but I've been to neither. 

The Station pub by the train station has live music most weekends, as do some of the other pubs in town, look for the signs. 

The black horse on church st is a nice little pub, and you can pop into Justin's next door for a dracula's fudge coffin, which I think is unmissable!

**Paid for activities:**
Much fun can be had exploring the tacky but nostalgic arcades that line the harbour on the ""new"" side of the river. You can play pirate themed crazy golf in there if the weather's bad. 

Short boat trip - must do because it's so cheap, especially off season, but wrap up warm! I've gone out on a sunny day and come back to the sunshine drenched by rain that was only happening out at sea! I recommend the Bark Endeavour which is a 1/3 scale replica of Captain Cooke's famous vessel, and you get some theme appropriate music along the way, or the Eske Belle if it's running which is usually more covered if the weather's bad. If the sea is really rough the boats go up river rather than out to sea but it's still worth it IMO for about £2-3 a pop, and in February, you might get the boat almost to yourself as punters are so low.  

Fishing trips: If you can be bothered to shell out a bigger chunk of money and get up at 5am you can spend the day fishing, not sure how successful these trips are, never done one.

Whitby Abbey: This is paid for as it's a national heritage site, if you fancy getting up close to it though it's visible across town. 

Captain Cooke experience: Quaint museum near Church st, if you're into that sort of history.

North Yorkshire Moors Railway: You can get a steam train ride here which costs anything from around £12 a ticket to much more depending on the route and type of journey. Not many trains go from Whitby, you'll need to drive to and board from the nearby villages of Grosmont or Pickering. Recently they've been doing a fish and chip supper ride from Whitby on a Friday evening, sounds great. If you really want to splash out you can book a dining experience as well: http://www.nymr.co.uk

Whitby Museum &amp; Pannett Park: Small victorian museum and park, recently refurbished. Costs about £3 and has a shrunken hand inside, only worth the trip if you're bored / really into museums and art. 

Rowing boats: In very nearby Ruswarp there's a weir where you can hire rowing boats and a small cafe. Nice if the weather's good but I'd check if they're running as it's off season. The walk from Whitby to Ruswarp and back is also fantastic if the sun is shining. 

Dracula Experience: A must if you're a fan, but be prepared for how hilariously dated it is :D cheap though!

**Free things to do:**
Walk up the 99 steps and take a look at the graveyard and St Mary's church. Great view of the abbey from here and of Whitby itself for photos. 

Beach &amp; pier: Whitby has a really long picturesque beach lined with beach huts, and a nice victorian pier to stroll along. Watch out for high tide though, when it can be unsafe to walk on the beach or you might get splashed on the pier!

Explore the town: This is my absolute favourite thing to do despite having been there 100s of times - some parts are completely stuck in the past and very picturesque, and it's one of the few places left in England with a majority of independent shops. 

Endeavour books: Next to the dolphin at the swing bridge, down a little passage called grape lane. Fantastic little second hand book shop to browse. 

-----

I've probably gone a bit overboard there but hope it gives you some ideas. The tourist information (located by the train station) are usually very helpful, can show you local walking routes, all kinds. To summarise, my favourite weekend there is just wandering the town and eating nice food, things like going in the museums and getting boat rides you can just do on a whim because the place is so small, the steam train's probably the only thing you need to book.

The bolt gun stuns the animal, but it is kept alive so that the heart can help remove blood from the carcass (residual blood makes the meat go off faster).

EDIT: Since the BSE epidemic, ""non-penetrating"" captive bolt pistols are preferred for UK cattle. They deliver a concussing blow to the outside of the head, but unlike traditional bolt guns, do not enter the skull and destroy the front of the brain. They are not rapidly lethal, and are also less reliable in producing unconsciousness, but they keep neural tissue out of the bloodstream, which helps prevent prions from ending up in the meat.

&gt; Also, the problem with this one is that the people were actively mistreating the animals, extending their suffering, not killing them properly, kicking them in the head etc.

As far as I understand, this sort of thing is contrary to Islamic law, which prohibits intentionally injuring an animal prior to the slaughter.

Also, abuses happen depressingly often at non-ritual abattoirs, and the public seems to regard anybody who raises concerns about it as a PETA-sympathising nutter.

Lallana, Markovic and Can all first team viable (compare with Luis Alberto, Assaidi and Borini of last year). Allen is now looking like a solid option for rotation. 

As for defense, while we lost Carra and Agger in quick succession post-Hyypia we had Agger, Skrtel and Carragher as the only 3 options (Kelly and Wisdom inexperienced at the time). A few years ago early in the season Danny Ayala came on when all 3 were injured vs Spurs a few years back. You have to admit that even Lovren is a better alternative than throwing in an academy teenager with no first team experience directly into the first team. Today in their place we have Skrtel, Sakho (Agger replacement), Lovren (needs some time to figure it out), Can, Toure (Carra replacement, out on ACON).

A 18-19 year old Insua had to become the first choice LB in a trial by fire (like Flanno last year) with Aurelio constantly injured. Glen Johnson was the only RB that wasn't an academy prospect (Wisdom, Kelly) though Carra did some stints there. CBs were Carra, Skrtel, Agger and Hyypia which was solid (then Hyypia left in 2009). Backup GK was Cavalieri in 08, with a younger Jones. 

We are pretty much a GK backup and world class striker from a full size team. You simply cannot sustain 4 top level CBs shown by the timing Hyypia/Carra/Agger leaving. In that respect with have Toure, Skrtel, Lovren ('top level' jury still out) and Sakho. Can is in the mix due to poor form of Lovren and Toure's ACON absense.

However, /r/DoctorWho is a community strictly for Doctor Who content. A while back we had a tremendous flood of people in just bow ties or just fezzes making posts of them dressing up and them dressing up their cats and such.

And this really bothered our users. Some people had made drawing and crafts and wanted to report news and start discussions about the show, but they were being buried by posts that barely related to Doctor Who. Simply put, it wasn't fair to them.

So we altered policy to exclude content whose only relation to Doctor Who was commonplace items. This meant tally-marks, cracks, statues of angels, and—as in your case—bow ties and fezzes.

Cosplay must be a full costume, I'm afraid to say. 

However, this does not mean that you have a bad post. Merely that this post does not belong *here*. We actually have a lovely sister subreddit, /r/DoctorWhumour, that would love a post like yours.

what a spoiled fan you are, have you forgotten about H&amp;G? you want them to communicate on every little detail, especially with spoiled fans like you who want them to go out and buy superstars every window and cant wait to pounce on any little thing you dont like?

you are something else with that negativity. in defense, midfield and on the wings we are especially deep.

I'm most amused by how easily those on the left dismiss Chris Patten when the right absolutely hate him. He's a widely respected figure and was the last British governor of Hong Kong (after Don Foster famously unseated him in the Bath constituency in 92'). 

Would it also interest you to know that Murdoch fired Andrew Neil from the Times?

As for Nick Robinson, so what if he was involved in politics when he was young? That's very much a non issue.

The BBC news organisation is bloody huge and if you want to cherry pick some individuals as evidence of institutional bias then go ahead.

null,false,TheMania,null,null,null,"It has no commodity or currency backing, which is what it means to be a [free floating currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate).

It's one of the more recently free floated currencies, only floating since the '90s. Before that it was pegged to the Deutsche Mark via the [ERM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism), and before that the USD via the [Bretton Woods system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system), so you could say it was ""backed"" by those currencies.

These days though, it has no commodity or currency backing. The primary reason it has value is the same as for other fiat currencies:

1. Pounds are created when someone takes on debt, meaning that each pound is owed by someone, and they'll work to get it back and extinguish that debt.

2. The government levies taxes against people for all kinds of things, from earning incomes, to making purchases, to owning land - these taxes are payable only in pounds, and so if you are to be able to function in the UK, you're going to need to earn some.

3. Because of (1) and (2), the pound is *very* easily tradable in the UK, and so it'd dominate trade even without legal tender laws. Eg, in Canada, there's no requirement on anyone to accept the Canadian dollar except every one does, purely thanks to (1) and (2).

The AUD, NZD, CAD, JPY, USD and every other free floating currency works the same way. They have worth because of they each are the sole currencies that can extinguish their government's tax obligations, and because when each is created, it's via debt, debt that people will work to pay back.",null,0,null,1422987496,null,0,false,0,coa0i55,null,t3_2ukm1p,null,t1_coa0i55,null,t1_coa01tv,null,null,null,1424233840,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Bellerin will be starting, NOT Chambers. He cost them £175k from what I can see. Monreal might be starting too, and he cost 9m I think.

It's not even close either - a stalwart like Ramsey who is 2 years older has played a good 300 mintues (3 PL games worth) less than Lamela.

The fact is, there are plenty of minutes available to go around even in the absence of injury - especially if you want your players ""fresh"" at the business end of the season.

Lennon had played 276 mins in 9 apps (3 starts and 6 subs), Townsend had played 385 mins in 9 apps (4 starts and 5 subs). Neither figures show Poch in a good light. How confident are you that Townsend could really put in a shift if needed when even his mins look peripheral (9 app in 22 games)?

I'm not claiming to be some kind of oracle, but if their players look sharper than ours in the NLD that might provide a bit of an explanation.

That's what's going on here really that's similar. This policy reflects a report that identified issues statistically significantly common to a specific group.

Real Madrid (Maybe missing a starting fullback): CB (Varane), DM (Khedira), AM (Isco), ST (Hernandez [I know hes on loan])

Bayern (Besides the fact that they have stars at every position already): CB (Dante+Badstuber+Martinez), DM (Lahm/Alonso/Schweinsteiger), AM (Goetze), CM (Thiago)

Man City: ST (Dzeko+Jovetic+Bony), AM (Nasri/Navas), RB/LB (Sagna) CB (Mangala), CM (Fernando+Lampard)

For the same reasons that I'd be willing to protest and fight for human rights (despite my believing them to be a human-created fiction), I have my own lines about what is/isn't moral with regards to animal treatment.

But it doesn't mean I'm right, and I certainly don't believe there's such thing as an objectively 'right' or 'wrong' answer when it comes to morality.

If people wish to draw their line elsewhere, that's fine. 

But the ritualistic slaughter business has a much deeper meaning (IMO!) - it's part of deep-rooted practices and beliefs that are keeping back huge sections of the globe from progressing and making rational and sensible decisions; it segregates people. I put it in the same category as the restriction on women's rights, systematic circumcision, and the teaching of creationism over evolution - i.e. illogical and not good for the human race's development!

Non stunned slaughter causes ""very significant pain and distress"" for up to 5-7 seconds in sheep, 22-40 seconds in adult cattle and 10-120 seconds in calves. The reason for the longer times is 'occlusion of the carotid arteries ... where the arteries contract after the cut and seal the cut ends"".
 
Incidentally it is possible to get [Organic Halal meat which has been stunned](http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/stunning.php). So ~~banning~~enforcing stunning is not banning halal meat or even the production of halal meat in the UK.  Over 80% of halal meat in the UK is stunned.

Even a 5-7 seconds would seem like a long time if you were drowning in your own blood. 

You can see stunned versus non stunned slaughter here. This cow could take up to 40 seconds to die. A calve could take up to two minutes.

Most BHA products also include drying alcohol which again is contraindicated in rosacea because it is an irritant. Note that much irritation is not visible to the naked eye. Rosacea friendly options for prevention or spot treatment if you also have acne vulgaris include

- 15% azelaic acid gel-cream (Finacea brand, on prescription)

- 4% nicotinamide gel (Nicam brand, prescription or at the pharmacy)

- zinc oxide sunscreen (should be using sunscreen daily year round with both 8% AHA and rosacea)

- dilute tea tree oil (5% in acne vulgaris, higher percentages for Demodex mites in PP rosacea)

- sodium ascorbyl phosphate (non acid form of vitamin C)

I don't understand this argument at all. This shit happens all the time, big clubs or not. You've got Chelsea and LFC who wouldn't even offer Lampard and Gerrard new contracts to retire at those clubs, and those players are bona fide legends of the sport. 

Every player, no matter who they are, will eventually reach a point where their sentimental value will fail to make up for the financial strain they put on the club or the lack of effectiveness on the pitch. 

I think the FANS need to be better to Lennon, no question about it. And I think the club should definitely do more for Lennon when he leaves permanently. But what we're doing is not small-minded or unusual at all. 

This is all completely ignoring potential other factors that we would have no knowledge of whatsoever. Maybe he's a complete twat in training, who knows.

Below are some of the policies I would like to see in the UK:  
Everyone paying the tax they should - including large companies etc. If it is complicated loop holes surely it could be made simpler and these loop holes removed. 

Everyone on Job Seekers allowance should do one day a week community service if they do not attend after a number of times that benefit gets cut. 

Teachers must hold a high grade (over 80%) in the qualification that they are teaching. This also must get renewed every 10 years. 

To reduce the deficit, hold few days a year where people have the day off like a bank holiday but for those days no public service worker that didn’t work. Only core services would run like a standard bank holiday. All the money made from this will be put into the deficit. This days could also be topical like “grow your own veg”. 

Relaxing the hiring and firing of people in the UK, I have seen people be on sick for around a year with the company powerless to do anything.      
A more controlled boarder policy, to reduce professions, schools, healthcare from being overcrowded.

Increased NHS payment for everyone, and also yearly checks like an M.O.T. If you pass, you have healthy lungs weight etc. your payment would be reduced.

What do I think they should get:

(a) Clarity (Lampard and Gerrard were told the position of the club so they were able to decide what to do next)

(b) Respect (what does this mean in a football sense? - I'm not sure but it certainly doesn't mean being frozen out of the squad. Even if he didn't start are you honestly telling me that in the last 39 games we've played he hasn't deserved a few more minutes.)

(c) The ability to have some control over their destinies (Lampard and Gerrard were both able to choose MLS even though it might have meant for the former a sojourn at Man City) - Look at the way we treated Defoe. Lennon has served the club longer than Defoe.

I've been working for many years (in different organisations) and not very many employers have tried to sneak me out of the building in the dead of night. Or publicly hawk me around as bait for another deal. You have to remember that the 10 year player is a rarity. A throw back to yesteryear, he arrived at Spurs when he was 17/18, he's practically grown up at the club.

I agree a bit about your point with the fans but sometimes the club provides leadership for the fans. If the club acted like he's a spurs legend on his way and we should celebrate him leaving the mood music would be different. Let's be clear, he hasn't demanded a move or asked for more money or any of the things that usually make fans mad at players.

I don't understand how you got that from the metaphor I used. I was comparing what you were saying as in bringing light to the situation making the bullying worse.... that's not how it works although there can be an element of Streisand effect for sure.

""Stop feeding the trolls"" is the same as blaming the victim for the trolls targeting her..... it's very obviously not her fault.

Bullies don't stop even if you ignore them. Just try telling the parents of kids who committed suicide due to online harassment that.

&gt;...sticks and stones...

Thankfully laws and understanding of psychology have progressed greatly from your days as a child and the coining of the term itself. This isn't schoolkids teasing another child. Even then it's totally wrong (and why schools put in place anti-bullying policies).

It would be great if it was just people calling her names, but they aren't. They are systematically posing rape and death threats towards a rape victim in order to shut her down from spreading her story.

All ""sticks and stones"" does is re-enforce to the target of abuse that they are wrong for getting angry about their abuse.... which is unequivocally wrong.

And before you say it (""just don't go on the internet/twitter etc"") - No. Everyone has the right to an online presence and to use those services within their terms of use. Saying she should just get off it again re-enforces that she is at fault for giving them an avenue to harass her.

1. Personally, I loved studying there. Sydney Jones/Harold Cohen libraries are great, as is the public Central Library in the city centre. My course was very high quality, and I was taught by people well known in their subjects. The union has coffee shops, bars and restaurants which you could enjoy or even work at to support your degree.

2. Liverpool is well known for being a great student city. Compared to other places like Stoke or Nottingham, students are rather warmly received here. It's a cheap night out if you know where to go, and if you smoke cannabis sometimes, that is pretty easy to come by. Lots of things to do, but not so much that you're overwhelmed by it. Great affordable restaurants, and there's an Aldi in the shopping centre which is very cost affective on shopping. After first year people go to live outside of the city centre, and go and live on Smithdown road, a few minutes out of the centre by bus. I never figured out why people did this, as it is a robbery hotspot, it isn't significantly cheaper than private accommodation in the city centre, and means you'll have to get a bus twice a day. 

3. Liverpool isn't expensive. I wouldn't go into halls on first year and get private accommodation around Mount Pleasant, purely because UoL's accommodation costs are extortionate, but that's just me. Whatever you pay in London, it won't be worth whatever you're getting. Liverpool is very much the opposite.

4. Not great. I used to work at LJLA, and had to commute to work there. It initially took 45 minutes on the 86a/80a buses, but as bus lanes have been obsoleted in the city, this takes significantly longer. Liverpool South Parkway acts as the train station for the airport, but you'll still have to get a bus through Speke to get to the airport itself, and the bus fare is the same as it would be if you went from the city centre. The earliest buses to/from the airport are around 6ish I think, and the latest can go until just after midnight.

The Golden rule is practically the most minimal axiom set you could imagine upon which to base the concept of morality.  You don't even have to believe in morality itself, or that being moral is a good thing.  If you want, you can just think of it as a 'principle of cooperation', which empirically appears to create safe societies.  (Whether you think safe societies are a good thing is up to you, but *if* you wish to live in such a society, then Golden rule approaches will work better than alternatives.)

No faith is required.  None whatsoever.  Mathematicians can and have shown the benefits of cooperative behavior patterns for maximizing survival in certain environments.  Biologists have shown that for some species, including our own, that cooperation can arise naturally through evolution.  And there are more and more scientific experts studying the scientific underpinnings of morality.

If you make that argument then it is disingenuous to look just at the cost of a perceived starting lineup but also total income.

I was just saying that by not including our most expensive buys it doesn't really do justice to the club's ability to properly evaluate talent. If her/his point was to say we have spent way less over a period of time, then starting lineups is a weird way to do it, why not just show the overall numbers like you did. 

Also don't Soldado (high 20's), Lamela (30), Vorm (4?), and Paulinho (16?) alone add up to like ~70mil in bench players? add in Chiriches or Kaboul or Davies and Dembele and it is like 90sh which is more than the bench players you pointed out.",null,0,null,1422996921,null,0,1422997301,0,coa6d2d,null,t3_2unqxv,null,t1_coa6d2d,null,t1_coa4yf1,null,null,null,1424231106,null,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

What a condescending little meff *you* are. Don't give me shit because I don't share your 'everything's fine' point of view. I've supported this club for 30 years, I've gone through the full gamut with it and I know full well when someone's pissing on us and telling us it's raining.

Knobheads like you were giving it when Hicks and Gillet had the club too, buying into their shit just like you're doing now.

&gt;...you want them to communicate on every little detail

Without fans there is no club. The club needs to appoint a local man, who knows football. With all due respect to the Americans who have been involved for the last few years, they're not football men and that has cost us in the transfer market.

&gt;especially with spoiled fans like you who want them to go out and buy superstars every window...

Now you're just making up shit. I said about bringing in decent loans. I've not advocated buying superstars, but it's all good so long as you get to marginalise me and carry on thinking you know it all. You know sweet FA from the sounds of it.

&gt;and cant wait to pounce on any little thing you dont like?

Is English your first language? I ask because you seem to have a hard time understanding it.

&gt;you are something else with that negativity.

Calling a spade a spade's negativity now is it? Is it fuck. We've got some exceptional players, we're seeing development happen on the ground front. That's all well and good, but that doesn't fix problems in other areas, does it?

We *needed* a striker and a new keeper this window. Either temp or perm. If we could have brought in another DM that would have been nice too. Instead we get fuck all and some news RE a contract at the eleventh hour. 

It's great that Coutinho's signed on but he isn't going to go in goal if things go wrong is he? Or play as a striker?

&gt;...this isnt going to be some perfect world or your fifa dream team where they snap up players willy nilly

More delusional shite. What are you even going on about?! Do you even know?

&gt;fact is they spent loads of money and are STILL trying to sort out the players they bought

Because they solely bought potential. Some of which is shaping up nicely. **Some** of which. That's the problem with potential though, it doesn't always work out. 

On top of the youngsters we needed some firm, mature talent. Not galactico bawbags, but established, experienced lads. We got none of it. The board knew Suarez was going almost a year in advance but we were still left holding our cocks come deadline day last time and what happened then? We ended up with Balotelli who, with the best will in the world, can't be arsed.

&gt;and the team is playing well now

And what happens if we get an injury? Do tell.

&gt;AND sturridge is back.

That's all that matters, eh? He can play rush goalie and bang in goals at the other end and its not as if he gets injured is it?

&gt;I really dont know what youre expecting, but its not realistic.

I've told you but you're too busy living in some fucking dream world, going on about FIFA and superstars. Read what I wrote. It's all there in black and white.

&gt;And if THIS isnt the deepest squad we've had in years, Id like you to point me to one that was, because it certainly wasnt last season or 08/09,.

Our 07-08 squad would fuck the current one into a cocked hat. As would our 06-07 squad if truth be told. Are you a recent convert or something? Because if you honestly think we're on top now, you're either a new fan or you've got a short memory.

null,false,madmoneymcgee,null,null,null,"&gt;Commuter railways in the Home Counties transport a quarter of a million passengers into London during the morning peak hour, many of whom have to stand during their journey. 

&gt;The Institute of Economic Affairs - which was closely linked with the foundation of Thatcherism in the late 1970s - said in a report published on Tuesday morning that a “viable alternative” is to convert rail tracks into bus lanes. 

We have a capacity problem! Let's solve it by introducing a lower capacity service. 

&gt;The report published today said that “150 express coaches, each seating 75 individuals would be able to carry the same number of commuters while occupying one seventh of the capacity of a one-lane busway”. 

And massively increasing the number of drivers/staff needed to run the buses and more vehicles that need time and space away from each other. 

&gt;It added: “Converting commuter railways into busways would bring about cheaper fares for passengers, as operating and infrastructure costs would be much lower

Nothing says ""cheap"" like a massive capital project to completely repurpose existing infrastructure. 

&gt;“Although the initial cost of conversion would be substantial, adding new rail capacity and continuing rail subsidies would be far more expensive.” 

Replace train subsidies with bus subsidies. Ok.

&gt;Richard Wellings, the report’s co-author and the IEA’s Head of Transport said: “Ongoing interference by politicians in the rail industry has led to everyone getting a raw deal. 

So uh, why not just fix that problem instead scrapping the whole thing? 

&gt;“Passengers face increasingly expensive fares only to fight their way onto trains during peak times and taxpayers continue to prop up an industry whose importance to the country is disproportionally small relative to the level of resources it receives. 

And when the bus gets crowded you're still have the same problem just with a MUCH less comfortable ride. ",null,0,null,1422998440,null,0,1423055220,0,coa7bn5,null,t3_2uo988,null,t1_coa7bn5,null,t3_2uo988,null,null,null,1424230658,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

&gt;He has been a driving force in the Buckinghamshire club’s ascent to second in League One this season, scoring 12 league goals in 27 games from one of the deeper midfield positions in their 4-2-3-1 formation


&gt;**Alli’s role in Milton Keynes is almost identical to Mason’s under Pochettino** and he boasts the combination of technical ability and athleticism that the Argentine craves. He is 6’2” tall and quick but has been schooled in a Dons academy renowned for producing skilful, creative players who excel in one-on-one situations.

It makes a lot of sense that we would prioritize Alli if this is his skillset. Pochettino must have recognized by this point that Bentaleb and Stambouli are far more effective than anyone else in the deeper role of the double pivot while Mason is really the only player who gets it done as the more advanced member of the pairing. Paulinho has been woeful on the whole (I can grudgingly admit that he wasn't completely terrible against WBA, but this hasn't been a good season for him), and Dembele has been similarly poor in the deeper role. This is a position that we needed help in, because Mason doesn't have the durability to play that much. 

But for people saying he's going to go out on loan, I'm not so sure. I think Pochettino will want to spend time with him and get him playing in our system. Sending him out on loan puts him in someone else's hands.

The fact that devolution is a significant desire for the Scottish electorate is not designed to descriminate against the English - put simply, the English constitutional arrangement is a shambles.

This didn't used to be a problem when England effectively ruled the British Empire but devolution has not highlighted for me an unfairness in having Scottish , Irish and Welsh MPs still in the *British* parliament (t'is a union after all) but that there is an inequality in that the English MPs can **only** be elected to the *British* parliament. Likewise, the British government administers healthcare not for the whole of Britain but for England.

That's a majour imbalance in the democratic make up of the UK. EVEL will be like plastering a cancer - a superficial solution to an endemic disease. Serious democratic reform needs to take place in the long term in order to equilibrate the balance of power between the 4 nations and deliver local but separate government.

As a first step I would recommend reading this: [NHS Choices: Sertraline](http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/medicineoverview.aspx?condition=Depression&amp;medicine=sertraline) and the leaflet that came with the medication. In particular note the comment in the ""Your medication"" section on the NHS Choices Seraltine about how for some people can get suicidal thoughts early on when taking this.

Second, dont act on these thoughts, they are being caused by the medication.

Third, call your GP first thing tomorrow morning and get an appointment to speak with them face to face so you can get some proper advice. If you feel really low tonight call 111, do not act on these thoughts.

Fourth. While you are at the GP ask about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or something similar. Medication is great for stablising things (when you are not getting nasty side effects), but you want to couple it with addressing the underlying issues of your problems. You may find CBT helps.

**tl;dr**: Do not act on these suicidal thoughts, they are a side effect, go see your GP first thing tomorrow or call 111 now.",null,0,null,1423000576,null,0,false,0,coa8ok1,null,t3_2uohbb,null,t1_coa8ok1,null,t3_2uohbb,null,null,null,1424226976,null,11,false,UKHealthcare,t5_2v0gp,11,null

I don't consider those restrictions on free speech, mainly because wearing a sombrero or playing someone else's song isn't speaking. When they prevent speakers from attending events just because they don't like their views then that is very much a restriction on free speech.

I think the root of this problem is student politics is often dominated by idealist left-wing activists. The problem being not what they believe, but that there's not much opposition to them to bring balance to politics. Being activists they want to be doing things to show others (and ultimately themselves) that they're doing good deeds, and because they're the only ones that give a shit about campaigning and voting they get away with doing ridiculous things like banning the armed forces or BAE Systems from campuses.

Most students probably couldn't give a shit about university politics - I felt that it did bugger all for me and most of the elected union positions would have been better served by full time members of staff. By all means let students stand as representatives to provide an interface between students and the union but I don't see why they should be given so much power.

*  What about replacing a faulty gene on the nuclear genome? Say, replacing the HTT locus so a parent with homozygous Huntingtons can have a child without Huntingtons. Don't the same arguments apply - it's only 0.006% of the total genome, isn't really a part of their characteristics etc.

* What then, about genes that carry significant risk? Isn't it sensible to replace someone's BRCA2 with someone elses if the variation both parents has indicates a higher risk for breast cancer?

* What then, about defects which are of marginal risk? Being ginger, pale and freckly makes you more likely to develop skin cancer.

It's a song whose lyrics are open to interpretation, and some have interpreted as being about the singer trying to coerce and pressure a girl into sex. Which certainly is a nasty subject for a song, and the people who think that have justified why they think it. But it's still only their interpretation and there exist other interpretations of it. One opposing argument I saw claims that the song refers to a woman who the singer knows is interested in him and is being coy, pointing out that the notorious ""I know you want it"" line is followed by ""so come on and get at me"" - telling the woman to stop being coy and make a move on him, putting the ball in the woman's court. It was further pointed out that even in the video the male singers just stand back and look at the women, they don't impose themselves on them. Instead it's the women touching the men - again, acting with their own agency.

Who is right? Only the writer knows what the meaning behind the song is supposed to be. And regardless of what it means, if people are widely interpreting the lyrics as alluding to rape and the union feels it would encourage similar behaviour among its students then that's reasonable grounds for banning it, but saying ""this song is definitely about rape"" is presuming to know better than the people who wrote it, and a very harsh judgement to make on them if it turns out it wasn't about rape at all.",null,0,null,1423002542,null,0,false,0,coa9vxm,null,t3_2uju3s,null,t1_coa9vxm,null,t1_co9wehr,null,null,null,1424226413,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

That doesn't mean we play for draws. It does mean we don't over extend ourselves for overvalued talent to appease supporter's unclear ideas of what progress is. And it also doesn't mean we stop pushing for Europe. I haven't the foggiest idea where you're getting that from. We have 2 clear avenues into Europe and we will pursue both. In no way are we out of contention for the Europa League spots, and as long as the FA doesn't cave to FIFA's sniping, we've got as clear a shot thru the FA Cup as any other side.

Southampton is having a good season, but I fail to see how they're in any way comparable to us, apart from your erroneous perceptions of our clubs being identical in size, structure, potential and motivation. They've more or less had the same side for near a decade. Their Academy system is one of the few that is built to find raw talent, develop it and then sell it on to subsidize their club. That we still call ourselves 'The Academy' is laughable in the face of what they've developed. Additionally they arguably have the best front office in the UK, one of the best scouting systems in the world, as stated, one of the best youth development systems in the world and a succession of promising, tactically astute, talented young managers who brought with them a stable of new and under the radar high quality and relatively inexpensive players. 

They are set up to compete at the highest levels, even if they're a relatively small club. They built from the inside out. They're ready. We are building that infrastructure, but in many ways we are years behind them. It's an apples to oranges overly simplistic comparison, and it doesn't hold water. If we should have brought anyone in during the transfer window, it should have been Southampton's organization from kit manager to head scout.

I don't mind you asking me to explain my reasoning, but don't feel like you have the right to label me defeatist or negative before you've asked. You have no idea what Southampton's business plans were at the start of the season let alone whether or if they modified them at mid term. I've supported this club for 42 years, and if you genuinely think my preferences are to see the club fall on its face, then you are thoroughly misguided. Maybe your time would be better spent looking for posts belonging to people who have spent the last 5 or 6 weeks gnashing their teeth and ripping out their hair over our inability to not defeat every opponent we have faced. I'm not one of those people. Somewhere back  at the start of December I believe I said that we would have a very, very difficult Jan and Feb and that we would be lucky to get through without racking up several losses. Why? Because I'm negative? Nope. Because I'm realistic, and therefore quite optimistic about where our club is. Keep your eye on the big picture. Don't fall for the siren's song. Big picture. You'll have your top 6 soon enough.

Lastly, I'll ask you, who did we need to sign so desperately in that window that would have pushed us to where you think we need to be? Who was available that would have made that much of a difference that the January price tag would have made it worthwhile? And again, please don't say Adebayor.

We know for sure that some people's mitochondria don't work great, and that this can lead to a diverse range of symptoms over a spectrum of severity in individuals. It seems likely that everyone works this way - your mtDNA is different to mine, so yours might work better or worse in any particular aspect.

Short of it is that the Sale of Goods Act still applies, and to quote from the AA's page, it must be:
&gt; * Of satisfactory quality
&gt; * Fit for purpose, and
&gt; * As described

&gt; The dealer must have the right to sell the vehicle and is legally obliged to sort out the problem if it fails to meet these basic requirements.

&gt; Satisfactory quality means that the vehicle should be of a standard a reasonable person would expect, taking into account factors such as: age, value, history, mileage, make, durability, safety and description.  An old car with high mileage would not be expected to be as good as a younger car with low mileage but each should still be roadworthy, reliable, and in a condition consistent with its age/price.

&gt; The dealer is liable for faults with the vehicle - that mean it was not of satisfactory quality - that were present at the time it was sold even though they may only become apparent later on.

From the Which? link,
&gt; **Returning a second hand car**

&gt; If there's a problem with a second hand car soon after you've bought it, for example, the car develops a problem you wouldn't expect for the car's age and mileage, or it turns out not to be what you’d been led to expect, you may have the right to reject and return the car and get your money back.

&gt; But you only have a reasonable time to reject a second hand car. While there's no clear definition of what a reasonable time is – it probably needs to be within three to four weeks – less if it's an obvious problem.

I take on board your points with the Lambert comparison and I agree to some extent. But the difference I see with Ings and Lambert is the age difference and also the fact that Ings would suit our style a lot more. In our system we need players who press which Ings has. We also need players who are willing to run in behind the defence and get in the right positions, which Ings also has. And lastly I think pace is a big thing which Ings has over Lambert.

null,false,royalt213,null,null,null,"Perhaps my comments sounded like they were insinuating that we needed to make some acquisitions in the transfer window, since I was replying to your comment wherein you had mentioned those things.  However, I was not referring to that whatsoever.  I was solely referring to your perception of the club.

&gt; We played in the upper stratospheres of the league for the a good while, and a great many of us have subsequently accepted that that is where we belong. It isn't. Mid table is where we belong.

I don't feel like I need to ""ask"" you anything about being negative or defeatist when you say something like that.  Whether or not you realize it, that statement makes you a defeatist.  You are essentially saying that it is silly for us to think that we can achieve more than what we have so far.

&gt; We all knew that we were due some injuries...

I don't know where people get this idea that anyone is ""due"" anything, much less injuries.  This sounds like one of many rationalizations in the course of finding a way to feel okay with underperforming to me, but perhaps you have a different reason for such beliefs.

&gt; You have no idea what Southampton's business plans were at the start of the season let alone whether or if they modified them at mid term.

I *do* know that Ronald Koeman laughed at the idea of being 4th in the table late in the season and said he would love it with a joking demeanor right after he was hired on.

&gt; Southampton is having a good season, but I fail to see how they're in any way comparable to us, apart from your erroneous perceptions of our clubs being identical in size, structure, potential and motivation.

I never said anything about us being identical in any of those facets.  My point was simply that *nobody* expected Southampton to be in the top 3 this late in the season, Southampton themselves included.  But since they are playing well, they have made it their goal to strive not just for the Europa League, but for the Champions League.  They are similar to us in that they too were not even *in* the Premier League as recently as a few seasons ago.  They are different from us in that they are not letting that fact make them believe that they ""belong mid-table.""  And while yes, they have a fantastic development system that is second to none, that fact doesn't mesh well with what you said.  You said they have had virtually the same team for 10 years. I'm guessing that you are providing that as evidence that they are further along in some kind of evolution as a unit.  But, as I mentioned, they only got promoted a few years ago.  They are in 3rd after having finished 14th in the table 2 seasons ago.  They clearly don't feel that they should simply worry about making progress in ""realistic increments.""  They worry about being the absolute fucking best team they can be at **all** times.

All differences aside, why shouldn't we be viewing it the same way?  Why *shouldn't* we hope and strive and expect to be in the top 4?  To win it all?  You say it's not ""realistic,"" but I think that *any* team should be unsatisfied with anything but being the best.  That is the *only* way you get better, not by being okay with a mid-table finish.

Player for player, I think we are, or at least can be, every bit as good as Southampton on any given day.  I think we can beat them on any given day.  And I will continue to take joy in our successes.  But to really appreciate success, you also have to be displeased and sometimes even angry about failures.

[The CAB have a good free online I&amp;E calculator you can use on their website if you want.](https://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/debt_e/debt_help_with_debt_e/debt_budgeting_e/debt_budgeting_tool_e/guidancenotes.html) 

Anyway once you know your total expenditure including rent, utilities, phone, car, food, TV etc including payments to parents - essentials and contracts mainly. Then do this sum:

Income - Expenditure = Surplus. 

Your surplus should be the money you would have left at the end of the month (or week if your doing it that way) for you to spend on having fun/buying stuff and saving. If you're in a deficit then you URGENTLY need to look at the quick and easy reductions in expenditure you can make - you can't get out of rent, tax, contracts and other obligations but you can change your buying habits with food and drink and you can look for free alternatives to things you spend money on like transport (bike?, walk?), entertainment (rent rather than buy?, free shows?), clothing (sales?) and technology (cheaper brands? second hand?). The best thing you can do is become super-conscious of prices and what your buying. 

If you are in debt and need advice contact PayPlan, Citizens Advice Bureau or StepChange who will help you for free. Never pay for debt advice - ever ever ever. 

It's up to you how you divide the surplus but once you know how much you want to save then ensure it's affordable and sustainable so that you won't decide to start digging into your savings when you want a night out. You can easily be over ambitious in your saving and it will tempt you to break your own rules. 

The rest is now your 'fun budget'. Try and stick to the amount you've given yourself. Divide it into weeks or days to help and if you need to, take your budgeted amount out in cash rather than using your card so that it's impossible for you to overspend.

If you end up finding yourself running out of 'fun budget' money too quickly even after being relatively good about not spending too much then ask whether your saving too ambitiously and are there other expenditures I can comfortably cut down on? Cigarettes? Transport? Eating out? In my opinion saving is pretty important but it should not come at the expense of living comfortably. 

The most important thing you can do is make sure you know what you are spending each day and on what. We're all surprised by how much useless crap and overpriced food we buy. 

Remember it's YOUR money and wasting it on shit you don't need doesn't hurt anyone except you. It's YOU that has to deal with the consequences of an overdraft and the consequences of being broke. Do YOURSELF a favour and save yourself the hassle.

He needs support and believe from the supporters and we should not blame every loss or draw on him whenever he plays.

I have paid ridiculous fees for a BTEC in the last few years.
The first year cost £4.5k and was largely an A-Level Maths class with elements of relevant subject matter on the side.

Second year came with a mysterious ramp up to £5.5k, and was largely irrelevant. 2/3 of the year involved lectures with every single Engineering student, both degree and BTEC and part/full time in the same hall. The other third involved Product Design and 'Communications'. It was an Engineering BTEC geared towards construction.

The only useful part of the year for my discipline were the 6 AutoCAD lessons we had. 6. All year.

This is on top of two consecutive years of arguing with the finance dept. over invoices and multiple classes cancelled because the university hadn't paid for software licences.
