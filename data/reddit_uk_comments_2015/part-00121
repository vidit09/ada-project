Suarez on the other hand, he's never ever downed his tools on the pitch, yes he's bitten people, yes he's stamped on people ,yes he's done more idiotic stuff. But ever available minute he is on the grass of the pitch he will do everything possible to win a match and I value that. 

I don't blame him for going to Barcelona, being a latin person, must feel comfortable for him. As well as his wife's family being there. Takes a bit of the pressure of having to take care of his own family a bit more. Maybe he'll enjoy his football more without the pressures which cause him to end up biting people.

To me(as someone who describes myself as British) that seems to leave Plaid or the Greens, both of which I have some issues with on various policy matters but who seem to represent the type of society that I would wish to live in.

I don't have a problem with people voting UKIP, I think it would be better if we all voted for the party we'd like to be in power rather than the one we thought would stop the one we don't, and I think the reduction in power of the larger parties will benefit British society.

True for true. Real Madrid is unbearably attractive for any football player, especially if you're Spanish (with the exception of Fernando Torres- Real Madrid wanted him when he was at Atletico Madrid, iirc, but he said that he'd never play for another Spanish club but Atletico Madrid, and one of the reasons why he came to LFC- that and the fact that Atletico needed the money for his sale. He didn't want to leave, but he had to, which is one of the reasons why I wasn't too sore about him leaving LFC, because it's hard for a player to leave their first club, not their second). 

I do remember in the Basque country there was some static (in the newspapers, like the odd article) about Alonso going to Real Madrid and it being a surprise, given his dad's links to Barcelona (?) and in an interview (he did a LOT of interviews in Spain, he and his wife courted the media there- HARD) Alonso said that at the end of the day, it was a job, and Real Madrid was the best club in the world, and the next step for his career. He did say that he had unfinished business with LFC when he first went, but circa 2010, he was settled enough at Real Madrid to supposedly ask Gerrard to come over. Then in 2012 an offer was made to Gerrard again, but he passed. 

That being said though, if you watch the interviews around a year after he left Real Madrid, Alonso was still cut up about how he got shunted out of LFC. The BBC one was telling, especially when they pressed him re: Rafa Benitez. Then Real Madrid... I used to follow some Madridista blogs and I remember them getting butt hurt when Alonso said that 'white wasn't a colour' (technically that's true, it's a tone, right?), and he did his job and was pretty standoffish for the first couple of years there, but when Real Madrid won el decima, in May 2014, Alonso was all, 'Now I feel like a Madridista, hala Madrid' only for him to leave in August 2014, oop. I know some Madridistas who are still bitter that he never seemed to love the club to this day- not like Liverpool- they'd jeer. But Alonso always spoke in glowing terms about LFC in terms of the people, the players of the club - and one of the reasons he went to Germany was the stadium culture and supporters.

Yeah, I think Benitez threatening to sell him really shook the romance of the game out of him. Considering that when he came to LFC, his father came along with him, looked at the club, met the players and encouraged Alonso to sign on and stick with it. Also, Alonso always said the supporters were always kind and friendly to him while the long transfer was going on. I remember the banners- Xabi don't leave ! He said that people came up to him in the street and wished him all the luck in the future, so the supporters loved him and supported him but Rafa... that wasn't his way. 

There's the story about when Fernando Torres' son was born, and Benitez called him into the office. Torres was expecting congratulations or even an inquiry about his kid? Nope, Rafa wanted to go through the match that had happened the day before. Hard man, Rafa. 

That being said, with distance, Alonso seemed to come to peace with Rafa and LFC (honours at Real Madrid, a Euro and a World Cup will do that for you) and he did acknowledge in a German newspaper that LFC and Benitez made him a better player, and a harder one, so read into that what you will.

He means they form limited companies.  It creates an assortment of ways that allow you to legitimately pay less tax.

As an example, if you earned £200,000, but only wanted £50,000 of it this year you could leave it in the company.  The company will only have paid 20% tax.  I'm pretty sure an employer would be happy enough to pay you only the £50,000, but they probably won't give it to you later.  This can be particularly advantageous if you have one bumper year.

Limited companies are allowed to claim various things as tax deductible expenses that you just can't as an employee, or often even if self-employed.  *(Not, however, as many as many people will tell you here.  A lot of people have confused, ""HMRC haven't noticed!"" with, ""This is entirely legitimate."")*

Walgman is right with his final sentence though:  *""The tax system is a massive blag fest where the honest pay the most.""*  HMRC doesn't have the warm bodies to chase everyone, or even a significant portion of everyone.

In 5-a-side match, they are not under pressure. They can do whatever they want just for entertainment. Gervinho might be poor in your eyes, but there must be a reason why a player like Hazard and lots of other big teams think he is a good player. Demba Ba might have scored some very clumsy goals for us, but he is also a talented player. Just look at the other goals he scored over the years. If they were bad at controlling the ball, they wouldn't have been signed by big clubs in the first place. They have been training for ages to perfect those skills.

I'm not an out and out carnivore I don't eat meat every meal as its bad for you. I do occasionally eat haribo which has gelatinous but like you I think I cause less suffering than the average human being. Whenever I do get meat, especially at a restaurant, I make sure it's organic and whenever I'm at the butchers I make sure the same (not sure how it is in England but here it's a wee bit easier what with Scotch beef being the only way we actually eat it as whilst it is a conditioning thing iirc it also has to come from Scotland and a small butcher will usually buy from a farmer he trusts)
I get that you dislike the idea of the way animals are treated and I think I said that unless ethically done I actually agree I just don't think that most farm animals are the same as people but I am open to the idea of being proven wrong, I just haven't seen anything to do so yet. 
Well done sir/maam you are the first vegan to make me think (usually the ones I meet simply yell meat is murder) and you defend your case well, all I can hope for is that I'm not the usual ""meat good veg bad"" prick that you guys have to deal with.

The guy that wears the silly gloves and stands between the sticks? He's the *goalie*, and he's allowed to use his hands. Our goalie is named Simon Mignolet (pronounced Psy-mon Mig-noll-ett, that part's key) and he has the best SPI in the GSA by a mile. Which reminds me, we love our acronyms - almost as much as you Yanks! SSD, SPG, DPD, BPY, GPD, TPI, HDMI are the most important ones, and you'll see those tossed 'round a lot.

In footie (football is much too formal for regular conversation, and is only referred to football in the presence of the Monarchy, or in broadcast) teams typically field 11 men, but are allotted an additional ""power-play"" player in each half depending if the team passes the TDP threshold percentage set by the referee magisteriat (the fancy name for the head ref) at the outset of the Thimblehampton flip at the beginning of the game.

Liverpool is obviously the best team in the world, and a good analogy in Yank sports would be the Miami Hots - we buy all the best mercenary players and try to win trophies like that!

Oh and one last thing, Tim Howard, the goalie for the USMNT is also the FTG for a team called Everton - which coincidentally is Liverpool's sister team, and many Liverpool fans also cheer for Everton, but even more cheer for a team called Manchester United, which is sort of like our neighbour team.

Watch and learn as much about football as you can.
2. Learn the history of the club: how it was founded, the Shankly turnaround, European dominance, Heysel , Hillsborough, the 90's, Istanbul, G and H financial disaster, and the rebuilding process and FSG. 
3. Learn about the current and former players.
4. Learn some chants, especially YNWA. 
5. Give your Chelsea mate shit, because fuck Chelsea. 
6. Know about our rivalries with Everton, United, and Chelsea, and why we aren't particularly fond of them. 
7. Play some football
8. For god's sake support whatever MLS or NASL or USL team is nearest to you, go to games and cheer the lads on, it's not that bad.
9. Pick up on some of our inside jokes, like Kolo, Jose, HYPE SAGA, and leaning.
10. Just because there is a rumor, it doesn't mean it's going to happen, and it most likely won't.
11. Whatever you do, do not, and I repeat, DO NOT end a comment with YNWA, it's cringey. 
12. There will be heartbreak as a football fan, just remember that it will never leave you. 
That's about all I've got, have fun!

I'll give a brief rundown because I'm putting off finishing a paper for uni:

Basically, Liverpool is one of the most historied clubs in bright old England - nay - in the whole world! (same thing really though, sun never sets and all that). One of the most successful clubs in English footballing history, winning 18 league titles, and 5 champions leagues, we've been struggling in recent times after our shite Yank owners Hicks and Gilette fucked us and made a scene buggering off while FSG bought us. You're right in thinking LFC has a rich tradition: the club is absolutely steeped in tradition, so much tradition we don't even know what to do with it. If only tradition won trophies! 

""How many Liverpool fans does it take to change a lightbulb? None, they'd just sit around talking about how good the old one was."" Sadly that pretty much sums up sentiment surrounding Liverpool in the Premier League era.

But aside from all that, LFC's home is Anfield, also one of the most storied cathedrals of football in the world (like Fenway to MLB). We hate our neighbours, Everton - who are also a club from Liverpool - and Manchester United who are only a couple minutes drive from Liverpool. The Manc scum are the most successful team in England, passing our record during the SAF era.

Shankly, Paisley, Dalglish. Learn who these men are, and learn why the Kop loves them.

This season his job was on a tight rope before he finally got his tactics together. Even his substitutions up to that point were awful.  His interviews are still terrible as he continuously rambles on about anything (of late people have not noticed this but before we started our run of form the interviews enraged me). 

We bought 10 players and spent over 100 million this summer and still, with only Sturridge missing our next best option was 20 year old Raheem Sterling as a striker. Our best defense consists of a player we bought last season, a player that has been with us for a while, and a player that we bought originally to play in midfield. We were terrible in Europe with probably the easiest group we'll get in a long time because we were lucky enough to be put into pot 3 this season. For those who say he didn't have the experience, fair enough. Then why in the Europa League were we utter shite for both legs against Besiktas amidst our great run of form, a league that Rodgers DOES have some experience in. 

Before you think I'm part of the RodgersOut brigade, I'm not.  I'm a fan of his and want him to succeed at this football club. He's gotten us playing better football that we have been playing in a long time and he's a miracle worker when it comes to making players better. I want him to be our Ferguson, I want him to go on and win us tons and tons of trophies, but he needs to do be consistent throughout the season.

There is also a lot of blind optimism with people applying. I think the most blunt shutdown I saw was for a guy taking BTEC business and psychology as his highest qualifications asking for comments on his personal statement for Oxford PPE. 

I only really used it for checking the posts / comments of some of the legendary power users as they generally were the only people who really knew what they were talking about. 

For example, MrM (iirc) usually had worked solutions for all A Level maths papers uploaded as soon as the exam had finished, which was a godsend for people's nerves when there wasn't a general cohort consensus on an answer.

&gt;Islam is essentially the same as Christianity in terms of it's teachings

Patently untrue. All the Abrahamic religions have their flaws, but Islam is by far the most inherently autocratic and violent of them.

It's in the central tenants of the religious doctrine. The notion of 'Jihad' and 'martyrdom' are exclusive to Islam for example.

There are redeeming qualities of course, but we shouldn't gloss over the negatives or pussyfoot around the delicate bits, it just comes across as apologetic or wilfully dishonest by virtue of a political agenda.

The headline ""is Islam against British values?"" is based upon the central tenants of the religion and their compatibility with the central tenants of our state and society. It's not an evaluation of Islam based upon the radicals, it's an evaluation simply based upon the faith; of which the radicals are a part.

And it's a fair question.

Britain is a liberal and progressive nation, we hold liberal values and we're increasingly secular in our outlook.

We should be wary of individuals and ideologies (religious or political) which stand opposed to our values.

This is a topic which should be discussed completely sincerely and forthright, but based upon facts and evidence, rather than meandering half truths due cautiousness over political sensibilities and/or serving an advocacy based political ideology.

I don't think you've done that.

&gt;if you actually talk to Muslims, most love democracy, don't wear a hijab and just want to enjoy the freedom that we get in the west.

The use of the full veil is increasing in Britain. We also have a very clear problem with radical Muslims preaching extremely conservative and anti-democratic values under that very political freedom they're granted here in the West with our belief in the right to free speech.

So yes, while these vocal radicals are in the minority, many Muslims identify with views they hold. That is an inconvenient truth.

&gt;but Christians have only been better recently, just look at Northern Ireland during the troubles

I take great issue with this. The war in Ireland was to gain independence from British rule. It became sectarian, and religious sectarianism was rife, as was ethnic sectarianism.

Christianity was not to blame for the war. It was not a war for Christianity, it was a political war; for a unified Ireland.

Neither side was at war on behalf of religion. Religion was a subplot; a distinguishing feature between people, fitting the 'us and them' narrative of two divided people at war. The Protestant settlers in Northern Ireland were (and are) native to Britain, and that distinguishes them from the indigenous Irish Catholics.

A stain on Christianity nonetheless, but religion is clearly a subplot. What you wrote is a gross oversimplification of a war that lasted hundreds of years

But I digress, it's a cheap point all too often throw into the ring when this topic comes up.

A criticism of Islam seems to always have to be met with a whataboutism (sometimes valid; sometimes not) about another faith.

It's tiresome, and not conductive to a constructive debate on the issues we face as a nation with this particular religion at present. That goes for the UK, and the wider secular West.

A good place to start for some considered and forthright views would be this debate:

I'm sorry, but you are wrong. Free speech as a principle means precisely that people can say stuff that we find abhorrent. 

The reason is that noone has the authority to declare what is and isn't acceptable, because frankly, even though we may be right in this case, society has a long history of getting it wrong. 


A hundred years ago people like you would have been requested exemptions for free speech so that people didn't ""blaspheme"", 50 years ago you would have been calling discussion of homosexuality ""obscene"" etc. Sure, you might be on the right side in this case, but you are supporting laws that make oppression easier.

He waited over 6months and heard nothing back, then his licence ran out and he re-applied. Back on his bike as if nothing happened , just spent 6months getting a lift. 

Although i dont agree, a little back story, the police caught him doing 70 in a 30, which is something that happens regular around that area at that time (i know it doesn't make it better, I'm not saying it does). But instead of putting the sirens on the police tailgated him in an unmarked, blacked out BMW. He told me he was worried he was going to get robbed, expensive and rare bike, so opened the throttle and got to 100. He said they kept up, still with no sirens and were getting closer, he opened it up and it wasn't till he hit 153MPH they finally turned the sirens on. At this point he was gaining distance, which is why he thinks they finally turned them on. When he pulled over he said he was more relieved than anything else.

So while i don't agree, he should not of been speeding, i also don't agree that the police should see something like this and not put on their sirens. If someone is speeding, then you get proof and pull them over, simple as. Why was my mate tailgated for the best part of 2mile. The same as this bike rider.

My simplistic model has rich person considering their annual cashflow. They have a certain amount they want for themselves, but the rest is divided between tax and charity. Up the tax amount, perhaps the charity amount falls. Lower the tax amount, perhaps the charity amount increases. YMMV. 

Clearly in the Gates' case, a windfall capital tax would massively reduce their ability to contribute to charity.

You're right, many individuals, rich or otherwise, make charitable donations. But they do so voluntarily. At least government taxation and spending has public oversight and impetus - the decisions a democratic government make are notionally decided by the electorate. Or at least can be publically encouraged or criticised. Whereas what a private individual does with their own money is their business. And if they're acting against the public good and they're powerful then it's not easy to eject them from power. Take the Koch brothers for example and the way they're using billions backing climate deniers.

Government can also take a balanced view on spending, at least within the context of a nation.

In all honest I don't know enough about the Qur'an or the Hadiths to be able to argue for or against this point. It is, for sure, an interesting one though so thanks for pointing it out. Nevertheless, how many people in the world are devout believers - and we allow them that - yet act in contradiction to their beliefs?

&gt; Use a bit of logic. How could a belief in a religion, no matter how strong, give people the ability to do those things? And if their belief in that religion is that strong, how do they so willingly go against it when it suits them?

My logic is it's happened before, and therefore perfectly possible. Plausible, even. Not even just killing people who believe differently to you (which happens all over the world constantly) but doing so in cruel methods. Perhaps the most wicked and barbaric were the trials of heretics: torture, punishment, hanging or being burned on  stake.

The real Islam, then, is not the Islam of Mohammed and his deeds and his teachings. It's the Islam that agrees that Mohammed was wrong, the Islam that is peaceful and tolerant, that is fine with gay rights and women's rights and the abolition of slavery, the Islam that does not cling to some supposedly final revelation from God but which changes over time to keep up to date with the latest ethical trends in wider society.

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;I'm asking why, when two rules in religion contradict, people might opt to go for the violent one, rather than the peaceful one. 

I'm not a muslim, but I believe there are established theological reasons regarding how muslims decide which of the two verses to choose if there's a conflict in the Quran. The reason I've generally heard fro ex-muslims is that the verses later on in Mohammed's life generally replace the earlier ones.  Unfortunately, these are the more violent ones. 

Edit:  [From the article I posted](https://michaelsherlockauthor.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/isis-is-islam/) - 

&gt;There are clear contradictions between the noble and peaceful verses in the Qur’an and their more violent and dangerous counterparts.  On the one hand, the Qur’an advocates tolerance and on the other, in exactly the same circumstances, it encourages violence.  So how does one go about reconciling these contradictions?  More importantly, for the correct application of scripture, how have the majority of Muslim scholars, for the majority of the history of Islam, gone about reconciling these contradictions?

&gt;To answer these questions we must first acquire some historical context.  The alleged revelations compiled in the Qur’an are divided into two primary categories – Meccan and Medinan.  They are divided in this way because Muhammad allegedly received his first revelations in Mecca, in somewhat peaceful circumstances, and he later received revelations in Medina, in the midst of war. [19] Naturally, the more peaceful chapters and verses generally fall under the Meccan category, while the violent ones belong to the later Medinan class. [20]

In all seriousness being Caliph, at least in my understanding, only really works if you have a monopoly on force (I've seen a lot of sociologists argue that any political position, including democratic ones in-between elections, works like this as well). It isn't like the office of the Pope where Catholics all just agree to follow his guidance (even then, many don't). Historically anyway, without the backing of a large empire the Caliph hasn't really existed for any practical purpose.

It's a tough one as well for Islam because even with a Sunni Caliph you still have the Shia, largely led by Iran that would be diametrically opposed. I suppose we could go back to the Protestant/Catholic divide to see how that might work but yeah ... it would be very messy at first.

I think that's a naive position to take. Don't let highly publicised failings excessively detract from what our government does day to day to keep this country ticking over as it does.

The UK spends roughly £10 billion each year on international foreign aid. Roughly £2 billion of that goes to Africa. That money funds education and health projects, lifting children out of poverty and improving quality of life for millions.

Domestically New Labour instituted the minimum wage. Fifty years ago Labour instituted the NHS and the welfare state as we know it today. Admitedly we don't get big projects like that much anymore, and our current government is ideologically compelled to shrink the state and reduce the role of government, but I'm a socialist statist at heart. I strongly feel an accountable democratic government which represents the people is more likely to operate in the public interest than private individuals with no accountability or oversight.

&gt;Re: the Koch brothers/public good - your politics betrays you here. Koch can/would argue that the public good is better served by maintaining energy prices at as low a level as possible.

Oh man. I mean, sure, they would likely posit that. But I think the Koch brothers are among the great evils of our time. They're also a pair of buffoons. So you're going to have a hard time turning me around on this. 

They undermine good science. They're actively interested in ruining the climate. They're unashamed about using money to intervene in democracy. I can't support any neoliberal defense of them at all, I'm sorry.

* Insurance.  Speak to your insurers about this - will they charge you extra? Will they even allow it?
* Cleaning.  Are you going to pay for a cleaner? Provide a hoover?

&gt; Right but you're still assuming that religion was the primary motive and not just the excuse. Religion was the excuse for the crusades and various jihads over the centuries, but it was never the sole reason.

Motives can be driven by belief. Witches aren't/weren't burned because people wanted to burn someone. They were burned because witchraft was associated with worship of Satan (amongst others). Heretics were burned because they endangered God's word. I'm in no doubt that in some of these instances there were other drivers involved as well.

Unfortunately it made the news for the wrong reasons as both businesses said their comments were not for party political purposes.  

But besides that, yes it is in the public interest when, whether  you like it or not, a large group of people who have the power to make a significant impact on our economy by their decisions express their opinions.  Just like in the Scottish referendum, the question of jobs and companies plans in the event of a ""yes"" vote are news worthy if there is potentially a large impact.

If you hit something which doesn't take you off it will cause a high speed wobble. The bike will shake it's head like crazy as the weight balance goes back and forwards and the bike snakes as the grip balance is disrupted.

There are two ways out of a high speed wobble/weave that is to accelerate and transfer weight and grip to the back wheel. Once you are stable THEN you slow down. You'll have a great story to tell later on and go home and think wow that was close and continue on your merry way. 

Or you can slow down, which will make it all right? Wrong, in a high speed wobble the weight distribution is shifted forward intensifying the wobble causing it to jerk around like crazy it'll throw you off and slam you into the ground and the bike will roll and slam into you and the ground creating a shotgun effect and you will end up in intensive care for months.

Case in point the UK motorbike police USED to ride Honda ST1300 pan Europeans. The modifications the UK police made to it cause high speed wobbles. UK police training taught cops to SLOW DOWN. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6600897.stm

One of the cops went into a high speed wobble. He was inexperienced as a rider and slowed down like a car driver would. Bike did exactly as above all 320 kilos of it. He died at the scene. This is listed on the St1300 wikipedia page. The UK motorbike police then barred all St1300 use and Manchester police went onto their NT650Vs and funky ZZRs. Honda and the UK police went back and forth about the blame. 

As a result the UK police bought BMW R1200RT, Honda ST1100 Pan-Europeans were bought back out of retirement, and Yamaha FJR1300 were used as patrol bikes.

Are you a car driver? It is a very normal attitude of a car driver to think see something iffy slow down. 

For example somebody runs out in front of you?

Car attitude slam on brakes and skid (note ABS has a greater stopping distance than manual brakes).

Bike attitude swerve out of the way you are specifically taught this on MOD1 test (bikers have to go through 3 tests 4 if you are under 24). If you take the car attitude to a bike and grab the front brake you will low side, the front wheel unless it is a perfect road surface (which it won't be)  and you are 100% upright. The front wheel will wash out bike will slide out from under you and you'll break a hip and the person who ran in front of you will have 200kilos of bike sliding towards their legs.",null,0,null,1427879128,null,0,1427880563,0,cpxnizz,null,t3_30xm51,null,t1_cpxnizz,null,t1_cpxmnk3,null,null,null,1432133234,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The Brazilian politician in your example was absolutely within his rights to express his stupid views.. and people are within their rights to judge him for them, or to support him on that. 

What the right to free speech doesn't grant him however, is the right to use that speech to manifest those views. 

He shouldn't have been convicted of hate speech for saying hateful things, he should have been convicted of abuse of power once he tried to use his authority to suppress the rights of others.

Can you see the distinction? .. the liberal position is that people need to have the right to express ideas, but they do not have the right to execute those ideas, and especially not to impose those views on others.

Maybe I was unhelpful with my ""anti-Tory"" remark. Perhaps that suggested I was opposed to that specific party for flimsy reasons. I can expand on that and explain that I'm generally progressive left wing in my political outlook. I guess I'm a democratic socialist statist? I don't know. But I'm opposed to, in general, the values of parties like the Tory party and UKIP and right wing values in general.

The intent behind my post wasn't ""cheerleading"". I was concerned about partisan coverage by public service broadcasters.

I imagine I'm particularly sensitive to pro-Tory propoganda because of my existing political leanings. But I am generally against partisan political rhetoric by a public broadcaster, regardless of whether that propoganda be right or left wing.

In this paticular instance it feels like the Telegraph story is serving a specific narrow purpose and it is unhelpful to run it uncritically, as if it were a public interest story. That seems wrong to me. That seemed like a debate worth having.

I agree that a democratic government is more likely than private individuals to operate in the public interest *as it perceives it* - that is its telos. That does not, to me, justify the original discussion of what makes a marginal tax rate of over 50pc reasonable.

Side notes:  
imo we no longer have the flexibility for new big projects like the NHS+state welfare because these two projects consume an ever-increasing proportion of the budget. We can fund one-off major projects by recourse to the capital markets, but the opex on welfare+health is so great that no other expensive long-term projects can be started. No Civilization-style space projects :(

Additionally, to take an extreme, a number of 20th C strong governments (Cambodia under Pol Pot, Russia under Communism, China under Communism, Germany under National Socialism) have acted in the public interest, but in a manner we today consider horrific. My personal view is that the smaller and weaker the concentration of power (whether that be for a private company in its market or for a government in its country), the less risk there is for harm.

Finally a slightly troubling question someone once asked me of the NHS was this: if the NHS model is the best (rather than limited insurance or other methods) why does no other country in the world have the same?",null,0,null,1427881163,null,0,false,0,cpxnxd6,null,t3_30wzn0,null,t1_cpxnxd6,null,t1_cpxnb9o,null,null,null,1432133423,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

As someone that used to work in Game, most parents ignore the ratings. We weren't allowed to sell games to kids under the age on the PEGI rating, so we had to deal with lots of pissed off parents having been brought back by their kids to buy their game.

I find it odd that some teachers are getting on their high horse about videogames, but I think this is a problem with the sort of people who decide to be teachers:

* Can't organise a union or collective action for shit 
* Turn blind eyes to rape gangs and grooming going on under their noses to avoid being called racist
* Throws a shit-fit if a kid plays a game where guns are fired or someone can be squashed by a car or someone says naughty words.

It seems like these busybodies are desparately trying to take some control over their lives - what better way than reporting parents to the authorities based on the latest, fashionable moral panic? This way they get to feel righteous without taking any risks. These are the same morons that were banning Dungeons &amp; Dragons in schools because it promoted satanism (maybe that was just my school) or screeching when boys point fingers at eachother and pretend to shoot eachother.

These people aren't going to achieve anything other than wasting social workers' time. Nobody is going to go to jail for letting their 12 year old play Grand Theft Auto and these teachers will try and do something else to feel more in control of their lives and find some other way to get off on feeling they can impose their internet-assembled morality onto the lives of others.",null,0,null,1427881765,null,0,1427882633,0,cpxo1kq,null,t3_311cev,null,t1_cpxo1kq,null,t3_311cev,null,null,null,1432133477,null,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

I believe you misunderstand the concept of Jihad. All Muslims must commit to Jihad. It is one of the main features of their faith. You will never persuade Muslims to abandon Jihad any more than you will persuade Christians to abandon charity.

However Jihad doesn't necessarily have to mean violent conflict. It is better translated as struggle, and can mean inner struggle (e.g. against temptation) as much as warfare.

That was interesting to hear about the DFID, I wasn't aware of those corruption issues. I'll have to look that up.

I find invoking 20th century authoritarian communism as the reason why all statism is bad a bit of a non-starter. I mean, by and large the bad communism was the Mao / Stalin model of communism, which became adopted in Cambodia, in Vietnam, in North Korea. There were succesful, moderate alternatives. Allende before the CIA installed Pinochet. Brazil before the 1964 American-backed coup.

And German National Socialism was anything but. The Nazis were a far right fascist party who firmly rejected public ownership.

I assume the NHS hasn't been adopted anywhere else because of the chunk of GDP such an initiative (rightly in my view) would have to absorb. And because it was only feasible to adopt it after the great suffering of World War 2. And since the Thatcher / Reagan neoliberal consensus the rhetoric has turned against public spending.

The Greens are relevant because they are polling at 5 - 7% in England and Wales, so whilst they may not get many seats, if their voters disproportionately come from people who would otherwise vote Labour then they'll make it more likely that Conservative MPs will be elected (the same for UKIP, but from the Tories resulting in more Labour MPs).

The thing about a ""minister for men"" is, warm fuzzy rhetoric aside, what would they actually do? While there are certainly issues men face (paternity rights, boys' school performance, etc.), are we really saying that they can't be adequately dealt with by the relevant departments, and that they add up to a full time job for a brand new minister? And that they are unified in some meaningful systemic, causal way beyond simply all being about males? 

So to take my two examples above- does the fact that boys tend to do more poorly at school have a meaningful relationship to the current situation around paternity law? Both really important things that need dealing with, but are they in any way connected? If not, pretending they are might actually make them more difficult to tackle, or lead important issues to be ""lumped together"" when they shouldn't be. Compare with some typical women's issues (pay inequality, gender imbalance in senior positions, women in STEM, and the concept of stay-at-home mums whether as a positive or negative), which all seem to be multifaceted manifestations of a single related set of things- change one and it affects all the others in some way.

The caliph is a *political authority* not a religious one. Similar to the Queen he is head of the religion but does not and is not allowed to by tradition to influence it. Religious authority is given to private individuals who have semi-autonomy from the political order who develop the various Islamic laws and sciences. These individuals are scholars or jurists who's focus in life is that. They are known collectively as the ""Ulema"". 

The Ulema at the time (and still today) had a thousand different competing schools of thoughts, interpretations and ideas and gave judgement (legally binding) based on these. They were all considered equal and valid even if they were completely opposite. So two judgements from different scholars could be contradictory but equally right. These two powers (Ulema and the Caliph) came to a head during the ""Mihna"" (test).

The ""Mihna"" was similar to the inquisition and happened during the early centuries of islam (9th century) during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphs. It was based on a school of Islamic theology called Mu'tazilla*. The caliph (Al-Ma'mun) imprisoned, tortured and killed any private individual or scholar who did not accept the Mu'tazila philosophy. It lasted a couple of decades before it was finally stopped and overturned. The horror it caused within the Ulema resulted in finally a clear dividing lines being made between the two powers. The caliph did not involve himself in matters of religion and the ulema didn't in matters of state. This separation continued until the collapse of the Caliph during the 20th century. ISIS completely ignore this, like many other things. I'm guessing the 9th century is still far too modern and decadent. 

*The Mu'tazila philisophy is interesting in its own right. The Mu'tazila believed in rational thought and logic in the hellenistic tradition. The test used was basically asking if the Quran was created or uncreated. Essentially if the Quran was created by human agency then it is susceptible to human reason and interpretation. If it was uncreated, i.e. the direct speech of God, his word and breath, then it is not subject to human reason and interpretation and is literal. By being ""created"" they meant created by God, spoken to him by the angel to the prophet and then to his people, hence created and not a embodiment of Gods speech. They got into interesting arguments like asking the literalists, if the Quran speaks about Gods ""hand"" or his ""head"" are you not then saying God is an embodiment of a human form and causing heresy?

I'm not going to excuse one set of half retarded chimps for a another set of half retarded chimps. They're both retarded chimps and I would like to see them both sent out into some remote wilderness and forced to fight in a hunger games style battle on live Television. The last one standing gets sterilised so they never breed again.

If we are going talk about those people who go into posts and remind people of bad things Christians have done, where does that leave you? Here you are hijacking a post mentioning Britain First's Christian Patrols in an attempt to make it about the loose collection of Islamoneds that form the ""Muslim Patrols"".

I'm not a coward, I just mentioned a fact about Britain First. Am I supposed not mention that fact? Am I supposed to deny that ever happens? Or am I supposed to praise them and say ""Good on you, Britain first for enforcing Christian Values by shouting at Hijabis on the street.""",null,0,null,1427883815,null,0,false,0,cpxogd6,null,t3_30wpv0,null,t1_cpxogd6,null,t1_cpxnz78,null,null,null,1432133671,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The fact is few people would fear that.  Understand instead that most pilots love to fly, there is nothing lower in life, than a grounded pilot as they say.

I want to be up there right now, the patch of sky I can see over my monitors, the little wisp of altostratus above the straocumulus, damn, I chose the wrong line of work.  I look at the sky today, and I honestly feel the same emotions when I think of past lovers, I should be there, in it's embrace.

Most airline policies I know of, would not dismiss someone for such health issues.  You wouldn't be flying, that's all.  For some people, that's enough of a reason to hide it.

It's always an interesting debate to hear, how people talk about their medicals, especially the old timers.  I used to fly with and was often instructed by a 68 year old, who failed his medical so couldn't fly solo, we had a bit of a falling out because he was doing aerobatics above my skill level, if his medical complaint (which was why he couldn't fly solo) flared up, I was worried I wouldn't be able to return to normal flight.  He took this very, very badly from me.  I probably didn't phrase it right either.   Pilots get touchy about their ability to pursue the love, the addiction.  It's also worth noting it's kind of hard to learn to fly, to get your qualifications you need to really be driven, so it's got to be a strong passion to take you through the bad times.

So no, I completely disagree with you.  Most airlines are A-OK with minor health issues, mental or otherwise, you just don't get to fly until it's resolved.  I could also speculate this was the case with the man who wanted infamy (no, I will not learn the name) as he had only managed a hundred hours or so, in two years, according to the bastion of disinformation that is pprune.",null,0,null,1427884668,null,0,false,0,cpxomuz,null,t3_3108cg,null,t1_cpxomuz,null,t1_cpxm2vw,null,null,null,1432133756,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

While I will not excuse violence, the IRA and associated groups were not bombing people for religious reasons, they wanted to end what they saw as an occupation of people who happened to be a particular nationality and religion. At no point did they claim to be doing god's work or indicate that they were creating a better society based on religious principals. Neither did the civil rights movement they attached themselves to (and then overwhelmed with their hatred) claim to do so. Their targets were not a particular sect, and they attacked their 'own' sect on several occasions. It was a ""Christian Terrorist"" campaign as much as it was a ""male Terrorist"" campaign. This is coming from an atheist, European federalist, cultural realist Irish person so people do not mistake it for condoning any of their actions.

Those with autism, for example, have great difficulty empathising with others and understanding that other people have their own minds etc. And those in a PVS *definitely* can't empathise with the suffering of other humans.

And on the flip side, many animals *are* capable of this. I mean you can just Google 'animals capable of empathy' and you'll get a bunch of results, The Telegraph [have an article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/8370301/Chickens-are-capable-of-feeling-empathy-scientists-believe.html) from 2011 reporting that some scientists believe chickens are capable of it.

Apparently testers aren't as readily available in the US unlike the UK so you could argue that we shouldn't NEED to return anything that has a tester. Almost every product in Boots/Superdrug has a tester that is usually reasonably sanitary (for swatching) but only Sephora/Ulta has testers in the US. Even Tesco and ASDA have testers here whereas their CVS and Walmarts don't have them. 

Saying that, Estee Lauder and Mac (I think) have a really good and generous (can be used or opened) return policy which I've always liked but actually never used.

The thing about companies reselling used goods was that Ulta (the offending company) did release a statement saying that it is their policy to throw out used makeup that is returned and if someone returning it says its unused, sometimes the sales assistant will just take their word for it and not check the item and it goes back onto the sales floor. I can imagine that customers are maybe embarrassed to be returning something used so they tell the sales assistant that its unused (I've noticed questions on /r/MUA along the lines of ""can I REALLY return used makeup to Sephora/what do I say?"") and it then gets resold.

It means you don't have to check the stand before you pull off and they don't need to bother with a stand switch inhibitor to the engine.

However if you go to bike sitting on it's stand, move it upright and then go to get off - forgot something, just moving the bike etc your stand is now retracted and the bike will just fall. 

If you have two bikes it making the swapping bike to bike confusing. More often I'm just confused why my GSXR won't start.. side stand down.

It's about trying to rectify problems that exist due to the treatment of women. 

This simply wouldn't be the case for men, because the issues which are encountered by men in our society are (1) fewer and less serious than those suffered by women, and (2) generally directly consequential on some other form of discrimination (issues with paternity rights come from the assumption that a woman would be a better parent, for example). 

A minister for men would make very little sense because of all this. Besides which, why would you give special representation to a ***more*** privileged group? 

Also, while renaming the position to ""Minister for Gender Equality"" might be a cute political move, it shouldn't at all affect the role of that minister, and there are also a number of problems with the move because (1), it implies reducing the representation of women (I mean, why remove ""women"" from the title?), and (2), that minister currently has a responsibility regarding ***all*** discrimination, not just gender equality, so to refer specifically to ""gender equality"" would misrepresent the role as not including race, sexuality, ability, age, religion, etc.",null,0,null,1427886302,null,0,false,0,cpxp08t,null,t3_311cs4,null,t1_cpxp08t,null,t3_311cs4,null,null,null,1432133932,null,6,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

The best concealer i've tried so far is Nars creamy concealer, i swear that this stuff covers everything but the price is very high :( maybelline eraser eye is good too especially for the under eye circles, collection lasting perfection has got some great coverage too + friendly price. :) 

When it comes to the foundation...if your skin is ok (other than the post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation), maybe a foundation with light to medium coverage (and a good concealer where needed) would be good enough? mac does some great looking foundations but they can cause break outs in some people (like me), they are usually giving out samples if you ask for it :) studio sculpt, maybe? Some drugstore foundations are brilliant too like Bourjois Healthy Mix serum, l'oreal true match, rimmel wake me up, some revlon foundations... and mid-high end estee lauder double wear light (i've never tried this one but people seem to really like it), Nars sheer glow or laura mercier silk creme (really nice one) are great.

I'd transfer your cash isa to a S&amp;S NISA, and then adding the max yearly limit of 15k of to it (leaving you 35k).

Then i'd put 20k in a santander current account (paying 3%/year), (leaving you 15k). This is also your easy access emergency fund (say you need a house deposit, a car, you end up out of work etc).


For the remaining 15k I'd look into peer to peer lending - there are peer to peer lending schemes which can give 4-8% a year - have a look at moneysavingexpert for info on those. You need to pay tax on the gains though, so you'd have to see if you think that's worth it. Alternatively a fixed rate (though the best i can find is 2.6% which i is meh), or a mixed index/bonds fund of some sort.

That gives you 27k s&amp;s isa, 20k emergency fund/cash and 15k getting say 6% over 5 years or so, which sounds like a pretty good spread on your situation. 

Further savings i'd dump into the best regular savings account you can find (though bear in mind you only get the average interest on those) for 12 months and then put them into maxing out the isa each year after that.",null,0,null,1427887416,null,0,1427887695,0,cpxpa6n,null,t3_30xgol,null,t1_cpxpa6n,null,t3_30xgol,null,null,null,1432134061,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

 I hear a lot of people moan about privileged Londoners getting everything though, mostly, it's economic. Business investment in London, transport investment, etc. I hear out these arguments then  I ask if they'd consider moving there. Only then is it suddenly a hell on earth in which no one would ever dream setting foot. They don't want to spend half their working lives on public transport, they don't want to pay a fortune for a tiny shoebox of a house with no greenery, they don't, fundamentally want to live in a big city. Just the other day I was talking to someone from York who boasted to me that he walks 5 minutes to work while finding it shocking it takes me an hour on the train, often standing for the whole journey.

I feel this is a form of double thinking where people feel being a Londoner is both brilliant and shit. Too many people want the positive aspects of London without any of the negative aspects. I doubt very much you can successfully decouple them, if so we would have done it years ago.

However, I do think some people seem to take the piss a bit with the amazing returns policies at certain stores in the US. People will return something because they changed their mind about the colour, or because they found another product that they liked better, and it makes me go WTF because now that item goes in the bin and the store or the company that made it has lost money. But maybe that's just because the thought of getting to return something because the colour isn't right is so alien to me!

I feel like in an ideal world, we'd have AMAZING returns policies too, but also shops would hand out samples like crazy so that the odds of you buying something and having to return it because it doesn't work for you would be massively reduced.

null,false,landaaan,null,null,null,"&gt;Capitalism is far more liberal in terms of boarders than a socialist or communist system.

Communism is a stateless and classless society, and therefore definitively more ""free"" than capitalism. 

Advanced capitalism relies on imperialism, and therefore benefits from these ""borders"" that allow more efficient exploitation of a larger pool of labour. Manufacturers desire to keep labour costs down, therefore have an incentive to not only use labour in areas with unfavourable labour laws, but to keep those laws unfavourable to workers. Nike doesn't want to have to treat Bangladeshi workers as well as they would have to treat American workers. Every multinational on this planet has an incentive for these borders to exist, for there to be poor countries and rich countries. 

&gt;Capitalism is far more liberal

Yes capitalism is more liberal, but only insofar as it refers to the capitalist notion of liberalism, which, by definition, can only exist through exploitation of the working class, and is therefore not ""free"" as you wish to purport.",null,1,null,1427888865,null,0,1427889747,0,cpxpoc9,null,t3_31187i,null,t1_cpxpoc9,null,t1_cpxoc0z,null,null,null,1432134247,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The exception of course being unrated material, pornography and crime scene footage, that is covered by child endangerment laws.

So that patch testing for skin reaction, oxidisation and so on could be done at a fraction of the cost of buying full size.  Which would probably help negate returns for 'not workimg out'. But I'm also aware that these are not as profit making as full size products for companies.  I'm also really liking that a lot of Asian beauty brands do tester sized packets for sale, it's much more attractive to try something out. 

Sales in England are refundable if not fit for purpose (the gist of the act). With make up thought it's so subjective to the person as to whether or not it works out. If a product flat out didn't do what it said - eg 24 hour moisturising tinted lip balm that ended up drying and flaking off like a horrible velvet lip laqure. .. I'd probably write a strong worded email to the company. If it was mid/ high end I'd seek a refund, or if say a palette broke just because I gave it a funny look. 

I would be pretty miffed if I bought any makeup from a store and it has been used. I'm okay with buying / being gifted second hand make up but that's a choice I make which usually has a price point to match the risk.

You could take the risk and hope someone is selling one outside, but it's never a guarantee that you'll get one, and even if you do it'll probably be incredibly expensive - I've seen tickets for this game on eBay for thousands of pounds, for the very same reason you want to see it - it's Stevie's last game.

My only other advise is get on twitter, and drop a tweet to the ticket exchange accounts to see if anyone is trying to get rid of any - here are a few:

Plenty of doctrine and propaganda contains explicit references to violence. *Thou shalt not kill, except in these specific circumstances* is embraced by just about every modern culture that exists. By alienating the Islamic community we do nothing to end the violence and bloodshed.

You have understand that in a world where people have nothing and exist between states of horror and alienation a religion is one of the few escapes people have - be that Christ, Buddah or Mohammed.
If you do understand and respect this then you're going to bring so much hatred upon us that we'll never have peace.

Facists exploit this, in the same way that the daily mail exploits xenophobia. It keeps people stressed, fearful and controllable.
Muslims no more live their life by the Qur'an than Christians live their lives by the bible or Jewish people the Torah. Some of them read ""hate the gays"" and others read ""love thy neighbour"". Some read ""don't eat pork"" and others read ""You can't use lifts on saturdays"". Within every culture that exists there are contradictions and teachings that can be manipulated to say whatever people want them to say.

You want to paint a picture of nasty Islam, ""lets get rid of Islam blah blah blah"". Its not a solution, its not awareness, its not an understanding of culture, it gives us nothing, no insight and no peace.

For a 16+ game it was rather tame, and even today I struggle to figure out why it has that rating.

But at the end of the day it is still down to the parent's to buy the 16+ or the 18+ rated game for the child. Currently shops are stricter with the rating system. When I was 9 I went with my mum to a shop I had my pocket money to buy some PS1 games they had a 3 for x amount deal, I picked up some child oriented games and bloody roar, went to the counter, the person said I can't buy it due to the rating and told me to get my mum otherwise I can't buy it, so I go and get my mum and well got the game. If you try that today the shop will most likely refuse to sell it.

Once you have a few years of experience in a field under your belt the relevance of your academic history falls away fast, the percentage of people who stick to careers directly relevant to their degrees is a demonstration of this. Most of my fellow developers have a degree, surprisingly few of them in anything computer related. My last job was in the financial industry and *required* a degree - I applied anyway and was accepted without comment on my educational history.

You can think of it like an antiquated family house that is home to Grandma and all her descendants. Because everyone lives under one roof, there's lots of surplus money to spend on replacing things that break - but they break because the house is overloaded.

Distant cousins have their own houses nearby that they're struggling to pay the mortgage on. Their spare bedrooms are empty and suffering from damp, whilst the kids are moving in with Grandma since her house always has new stuff. To help out, Grandma's house occasionally sends them kitchen appliances that aren't quite worn out and a cheque at Christmas.

If the kids stayed at home, and some of Grandma's grown-up children moved in with the distant cousins, Grandma's house wouldn't wear out so quickly, so the remaining occupants wouldn't need to spend so much keeping it running and could have a bedroom to themselves. Equally, the cousins could afford to fix their houses up and live comfortably. They'd even be able to afford their own Playstation then.

Instead, the cousins are told to be grateful for their hand-me-downs and handouts. If they want new kitchen appliances, the room remodelled every year, and a PlayStation, they should move in with Grandma, since that's where the money is - there's still room for another hammock in the garage. Besides, if the cousins didn't have empty spare rooms, where would people from Grandma's house stay when they came to visit?

That is an excellent question you have stumbled over. Unfortunately you seem to have picked yourself up and carried on as if nothing happened, answering it rather flippantly with the assumptions your already had. The question of whether the later, violent verses trump the earlier, peaceful verses was covered in great detail in the essay which was linked to you, as it has been by many Islamic scholars. Because this is the central issue in the ""which kind of Islam is more valid"", it's worth reading:

""
Abrogation (Nas’kh) – War Verses Versus Peaceful Verses

There are clear contradictions between the noble and peaceful verses in the Qur’an and their more violent and dangerous counterparts.  On the one hand, the Qur’an advocates tolerance and on the other, in exactly the same circumstances, it encourages violence.  So how does one go about reconciling these contradictions?  More importantly, for the correct application of scripture, how have the majority of Muslim scholars, for the majority of the history of Islam, gone about reconciling these contradictions?

To answer these questions we must first acquire some historical context.  The alleged revelations compiled in the Qur’an are divided into two primary categories – Meccan and Medinan.  They are divided in this way because Muhammad allegedly received his first revelations in Mecca, in somewhat peaceful circumstances, and he later received revelations in Medina, in the midst of war. [19] Naturally, the more peaceful chapters and verses generally fall under the Meccan category, while the violent ones belong to the later Medinan class. [20]

The majority opinion regarding which category of verses apply today has been fixed for centuries, justified by the Qur’an, and clearly demonstrated by the violent propagation of the Islamic religion over the centuries.

None of Our revelations do We [Allah] abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things?    Qur’an 2:106

When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best what

He reveals [in stages]- they say, “Thou art but a forger”: but most of them understand not.      Qur’an 16:101

He entered into coalition so had to give way elsewhere but let's not forget what he did get though. Rising the personal allowance, getting a vote on reform (even if it failed), preventing the Data Communications Bill, expanding free school meals for primary school children and they stopped May from scrapping the Human rights act.

As a Liberal Democrat voter before I am pleased at the amount they got though and especially pleased with them preventing the Tories from diminishing the human rights act and introducing the snooper's charter. Civil Liberties is probably why I went for them over Labour.

Now it's fair enough if tuition fees were why you supported them but there is a certain kind of Liberal Democrat supporter who seem to simply be anti-establishment and ditched them the moment they became part of it. They would rather the party remained ideologically pure and free of the dirty necessity of compromise than get some of the things they believed in passed into law. This even extends to the AV reform were many students and natural supporters of it didn't vote to stick it to the Liberal Democrats.

It depends on the substance of those pieces, of course. It's hard to generalise without having specific examples to call upon.

I guess in regards this particular piece it's very easy to see how the Barclay brothers and those 100 millionaires personally benefit from a Conservative government coming to power. And selfishly benefit - it'll make them more rich. Whereas I often find it hard to find a similar motivation behind a pro-Labour or pro-left Guardian article. It also feels dishonest to not disclose that a number of those 100 signatories have affiliations with the Conservative party. And to not call out that they're only 100 names from amongst 5,000,000 businesses in the UK.

I do this so to provide a decent quality of life for myself and my family. I pay tax into the system but take virtually nothing out. So if you, or anyone else wants to point a finger at me and shout 'It's greed. It's not deserved, it isn't meritocratic', then you couldn't be more wrong.

From my point of view, and those of many LibDem voters, going back on their election promises *was* the outright betrayal of the electorate.

&gt;It would literally be a coalition of the losers.

That's a pithy sound-bite for the media sure, but it's meaningless. Since no one reached the goal, all the parties were essentially losers. Whoever forms a coalition that becomes a majority is the winner, that's it. I don't see why that has to include the party who lost the least.

Let's say there were only 3 parties available, A, B and C. A and B are much more close to each other in terms of policies, C is not. The voter breakdown is A-30%, B-30%, C-40%. Why should a coalition have to include C? There is no such requirement in our election law. In fact, in 2010, Labour was given the first opportunity to form a coalition and chose not to.

Why does there have to be a coalition at all? Just have a minority government and have the parties debate each issue and vote how they want to vote. A coalition just means a bunch of back-room dealings where each party gives up some of their policies in exchange for other policies.

Clegg could have put tuition fees on the negotiating table rather than his cocked up plan on the alternative vote. 

If he went into the 2010 election putting forward these policies I would have more respect for him. If Vince Cable fought against the prevailing Conservative counter-analysis that the recession was caused by excessive spending rather than his own great diagnosis pre-May 2010 I would have more respect for him.

I would have more respect for Cable if he objected to the Conservative's plan of pumping up another housing bubble (e.g. help to buy ISAs) and ensured the coalition passes policies either building on green-belt land or removing some restrictions in building up town centres.

I remember that there was a feeling Clegg was the left's candidate going into 2010, and in June he decided to occupy the political centre.

I have friends who were in the Stop the War Coalition and voted for Clegg because of his anti-Iraq views and were mightily pissed off he decided to fuck up Libya.

The inevitable lazy response.

&gt;I have studied, trained and worked bloody hard to get where I am. Many poeople wouldn't want my job and many others couldn't do it. In the latter half of my 30s things are finally starting to pay off, but I still work very long hours, carry stress and responsibility and am often away from my family. I have taken personal and financial risk to get here.

Look, I'm not unsympathetic to a lot of what you've described. I don't know your specific circumstance, but it's admirable that you've devoted your life to something and worked as hard as you've described.

But I think people can be rewarded for their efforts without having gross inequality in society. Incentives can exist without the need for radical pay gaps. In fact there is evidence to suggest if the gaps in wages become too high the incentive breaks down - people no longer feel a high wage is achievable and give up. In contrast I've worked in low paying jobs before where a coworker has received a tiny pay rise in comparison to mine and I've felt a huge incentive to do better and match their reward.

Also it's a myth that what you achieve in life is a product of your ingenuity alone. I'm sure you've worked hard and taken risks. But you've had opportunities in your life which were a result of luck, or the circumstances of your birth, or being in the right place at the right time, or because of the intricate complex network that is the society around you. You owe a debt to the army and police who've protected you, the health service who kept you well, the schools which educated you.

Y'know, most people work hard. And are gutsy. And want the most that life has to offer. But they're held back by forces beyond their control of one kind or another.

&gt;The beauty of our system is that if you have the work ethic, the motivation, the talent and the guts, you can start from nothing and end up successful.

Sadly if this were true then we would all be rich, right? What holds the 99% back if we can all be as rich as the 1% if we're sufficiently motivated and gutsy? It's a myth.

**A History of Islamic Societies** - Ira M. Lapidus

**About you:** Compulsive lip biter/picker, frequently chapped lips from dehydration.

**Your opinion:** This product is for use on the face and lips but I've only been using it on my lips.

The stick part is more of a balm and I would ignore the sun protection it advertises as it's covered by a clear plastic lid (daylight will degrade the UV filters), but it's decent as a lip balm or a sort of sealant over your sensitive face parts if the fragrance doesn't irritate you. It does leave a slight white cast that fades once it absorbs.

The cream is horrible to use on lips, it's just like using a liquidy sunscreen lotion with a visible whitecast isn't particulary moisturising more greasy in texture with a stronger more noticeable fragrance than the stick.

I really wouldn't recommend this product unless you are actually going somewhere where the high PPD rating of the cream part is needed.

Source: I am similarly afflicted.

I began disliking children since my mid-20s and now, in my mid-40s, I can't stand to spend more than a couple of minutes in their company as they drive me up the wall making noise, aimlessly milling about, and/or suggesting 'fun' things to do like playing games such as making shit lego assemblages, or some never-ending round of bloody Ludo, or the wonderful ""No, **you** die"" - the role-playing game in which whatever you happen to suggest the outcome is ""No, **you** die"" and then you get punched in the bollocks or the glasses or the stomach by a three year-old with no concept of ""too far"" and far too little acquaintance with the physical reality of a clip round the ear. Or they cover themselves, and then the furniture in chocolate/milk/whatever sticky thing it is they've just been eating (even if that thing is broccoli - how does anyone manage to make boiled broccoli sticky?). Also they're riddled with disease that they pass on at the slightest opportunity. And then there's the utter repulsion of the slobbery-lip kiss (could we not just ""wave bye-bye"" instead - what's with the physical contact thing?).  
  
I've got my entire family plus my fianceé's family *and their children* coming for 2 days over Easter. If you read about a series of grisly murders in the South Yorkshire area you'll know who did it.
  
Anyway, as far as playing outside my house goes, that's fine because I'm fortunate enough to have double-glazing and - so far - the neighbour's children have yet to attempt to kick footballs at my car with the force of a small meteorite, but I've lived in numerous houses with single-glazing and you really can hear every tedious word people shout to each other in the street. The nob-head with the ""hur, hur, hur"" laugh was a particular favourite of mine. So you have my extremely grumpy sympathies.

I think it depends on the matters of individual freedom as espoused by the faithful. I think there really is a clash of civilisations in some sense, in that the USA firmly opposes its government having an official religion, but the radical Muslims aspire to a religious goverment as the ideal.

However, religions can adapt - there are parts of Christian scripture which are really objectionable, but they have been dropped as aspirations by all but the most extreme Christians (so extreme that they are just considered crazy by everyone else).

&gt;We shouldn't charge Muslims with responsibility with things that haven't done, don't approve of and couldn't change anyway. 

This is the same strawman again - I can only keep saying that nobody anywhere is claiming that all Muslims are responsible for the actions of a few.

However it does seem to me that there is a shortage of Muslims condeming the Charlie Hebdo killers without also condeming the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists.  That's not a tenable position. We cannot have it both ways.

The Tories can get much closer in the subsequent election than Labour can. 

The only thing I said for definite was that the Tories would win the most seats again, though I do think there was a better chance of them winning a majority second time round. 

So why didn't they just go for another election? The reason is that the Lib Dems were willing to go into coalition with them *and* offered reasonable terms. If they went to the public and appealed for their votes because the country needs stability then the Lib Dems could just say that they were more than willing to enter into a coalition and their argument would fall flat on its face.

*This moisturising, fragrance-free lip balm applies smoothly thanks to a glide-on-applicator. SunSense Lip Balm has a creamy texture which will work to improve the look and feel of dry, chapped lips. It's caring formula is enriched with Vitamin E to nourish the lips, whilst the high SPF content helps prevent skin damage due to sun exposure. Lips are left defended, soft and rejuvenated.*

*Liberally apply to clean, dry lips at least 20 minutes prior to sun exposure. Reapply frequently to ensure protection from the sun.""*

**About you:** Compulsive lip biter/picker, frequently chapped lips from dehydration.

**Your opinion:** This is my favourite SPF lip balm that I've tried so far, it's fragrance-free so has that generic slightly oily smell, texture is fairly light but you can still feel the oiliness, spreads easily and gives a sheen without being overly glossy.

It's probably too expensive for most people to comfortably spend on a daily use lip balm but I'd definitely recommend picking it up for Summer or a holiday somewhere sunny. Also wouldn't recommend if you're going near the sea or a conservation area with water as it contains Benzophone-3 which causes coral bleaching.

&gt;Implying the wage labourers would have had a job if the million didnt start the company

Yes, a capitalist can only grant a wage labourer a job in a capitalist society, that is correct. And, rather obvious. I guess what you're saying is ""we should be grateful that we have been offered the opportunity to sell our labour, because that is our only option for surviving _in a capitalist system._""

But what I'm saying is that we should abstract ourselves from this idea that the only way we can survive is by selling our labour to capitalists, by further abstracting ourselves from the notion of capitalism _itself_. 

Therefore, we should not be glad that we _can_ sell our labour to survive, instead we should be angry that we are _forced_ to sell our labour to survive.

&gt;Implying the need to be fed is a creation of capitalism.

Yeah I never implied that either, not intentionally anyway. I don't really know what to say to this, other than what has already been said - that there exist societies that have, do and will survive without capitalism, and that capitalism not only engages in but is defined by the exploitation of surplus value.",null,0,null,1427896491,null,0,false,0,cpxskxu,null,t3_31187i,null,t1_cpxskxu,null,t1_cpxs3fg,null,null,null,1432135616,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.""

There has been in fact no universal warfare by Muslims on non-believers since the early caliphate. Some proclaimed Jihad by claiming themselves as mahdi, e.g. the Sudanese Mahommed Ahmad in 1882.[13]""

null,false,ryanbudgie,null,null,null,"It's a good question. 

I take from both Irish identity and British identity. I hold no real feeling of belonging to a Northern Irish identity.
Let me break it down:

I'm Irish because, I view the landscape, the mountains and the scenery as Ireland. It's rich Celtic history connects with me as does its music and lore. 
So in my soul I am Irish. It's a beautiful mystical place.
I also harbor the very Irish feelings of shame and self doubt (Freud said the irish male was impossible to analyze) 
So my Irish side is that swell of pride in seeing a sheep on a cliff or a touched local simpleton eat grass. 
The republics government however stink of greed and corruption, they have gone against all the ideals of the people who built it. 

My logic is British. 
It's the part of me that yearns for social change and progression. It dulls the Irish pride during the Olympics opening ceremony when it reminds me that we built the industrial world and kick started the Internet. We produced radiohead and Stanley Kubrick. It's all about staying relevant and liberal. 
As a British person I too can get rightfully angry about involvement in unjust wars or a questionable colonial history. And there's chavs 

Northern Irish is a thing I want to be a part of but can't because of the other two. 
I can't support a team that over the last few decades has garnered a loyal following of sectarian people. 
The government is not reaching a point where it feels like it's anything more than the most expensive panto on the planet. 
It's like one child with two placentas that is decades overdue. Even if we birthed a reasonable country it wouldn't be right in the head.  
And then there is the attachment to loyalism I hear in phrases such as ""our wee country"" I may be wrong, but it conjures up images of riots and stupid flipping flags everywhere. 
Northern Irish holds no charm for me.. And that's a shame.

In 2010, Labour couldn't have made the numbers with the Lib Dems, they would have needed other parties, and that could be dysfunctional. 

I think the Lib Dems have done more than could be expected seeing as they hold under 10% of MPs, they managed to get a lot of reform through including a referendum on AV which the Tories and Labour plainly did not want. They managed to get 5 cabinet positions, which is roughly in proportion to their MPs, and they had half of the quad.

&gt;Well, that's probably true. Particularly in London and the South East. But I think our loopy property market needs fixing as much as we could do to bring up wages.
In fact I'm pretty certain the problem is houses. The global average salary is £11,291 so by and large folk are pretty well off in this country. We need to build houses, cap rents and do more to make properties affordable (and actually affordable) across the entire country.

Oh joy! You've taken a global average and said ""the people are well off"" Except you've neglected the purchasing power parity so in effect all you've shown is ""The UK is a fairly rich country"" It completely neglects that someone earning £11,291 in the UK would in effect be considered to be living in poverty in the UK.

&gt;You clearly have strong feelings on this subject. I do too. So I don't want to antagonise you or say anything unhelpful.
I do personally feel there could be more granularity to the tax bands. And that the tax regime could be substantially more progressive. I do think people earning in excess of £100,000, to pick an arbitary figure, who are earning 4 times the national average income, could pay well in excess of 50% income tax and still have a quality of life that would be the envy of the vast majority of Britons.
I would consider that fair. Not a punishment. Just fair.

Hey you! You're earning more than £100,000! Time to give over HALF of your income in taxes! 

&gt;If you're lucky enough to be earning £42,000 that puts you in the top 15% of earners in the country. That seems fair to me.

I love the returns policy in the US, particularly as in many areas of the UK I think you just don't have stores that stock certain brands/products so there is no way you can go and test things out and have to order online blindly for more middle &amp; high-end brands.  Since this type of branded makeup typically has a bit of a markup here anyway, this can be really annoying if you guess wrong as then you are out the money &amp; stuck with a product that doesn't work for you.  I also feel like stores are a lot more stingy with samples here.  I went into a Debenhams recently to check out a foundation and was told I couldn't have a sample.  I'm not about to waste £30+ if I can't make sure I've got not only the right colour but also a formula that works for me.  I waited till I was in the US and got a sample there. 


On the flip side though, as someone else mentioned, testers are not as widespread in the US for drugstore makeup (exception would be Ulta).  I do love the returns policy.  Sometimes you see something that looks great but it just ends up not working, be it due to colour, type, skin reaction or simply changing your mind. But I also think it can lead to more impulse shopping perhaps as you know you can always return it if you don't like it, plus personally it seems a bit wasteful.  I have occasionally returned things at Sephora or Ulta before but still try to research before I buy to cut down on this.  And in all my shopping over there I've never encountered buying a clearly returned, used product so I tend to think that's the exception, not the rule.

In this phase, if there's only one player advanced on the flank as there was with Mata, then he's got to be Moreno's man.  If Sakho comes out that far to mark him then we've opened a big channel right down the middle, so he can't do it.  Moreno, meanwhile, is just marking a huge empty space that no United player is looking to move into at all.  Even then, if they were to move into the space Moreno was in (assuming he went to mark Mata instead), then we're still keeping the ball in front of our defenders and the AM (Coutinho in this case) can mark the fullback there.

Our formation is very interesting because it changes significantly depending on what phase we're in.  The lfuidity of it is really neat, and it's something we're starting to see more and more of throughout Europe (Guardiola's Bayern is really the hugest example of this though).

Please don't exfoliate the thin skin on your lips or eyes, it is much too thin and exfoliating thins it further. If you have issues with dryness firstly look at your dental care products - no drying alcohol, no sulphate surfactants (the same stuff as in shampoo, for foam).

In the short term review your diet and lifestyle choices ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations. This can impact on skin health, sensitivities/ allergic reactions, the immune system in general. Oily fish is particularly important at this time or year and whenever you use sunscreen.

You can't, but you can sure say tuition fees are off the table as long as we're in government. You can say austerity is off the table if there's not commensurate taxes on the rich to close the deficit (since I know Cable is a deficit hawk). The Tories don't have a majority, so you have that power. You walk out the room, the government falls. That's what coalitions do. In Germany when there's a grand coalition, the CDU gets the finance ministry, the SDP gets the labour ministry, and nobody moves the political compass too far one way or the other until the next election.

Stopping Theresa May from scrapping the HRC is hilarious to claim as an achievement when they could have entered a coalition with Labour, which wouldn't have tried to scrap HRC at all. In fact, for a party that has taken a pretty passive approach to government, demanding that Labour effectively sack Gordon Brown is pretty presumptuous - I thought the Lib Dems knew their place?

They misread the political mood and they misread what their supporters (who I think are largely more sympathetic to Labour than the Tories) would think about entering a coalition with the Tories. If they'd kept a strong grip on the Thatcherites and dared Cameron to call an election, they might have done well. Instead they pretty much let Cameron's government run amok with no more than a few perfunctory tugs of the leash on things involving Europe, and their support has bailed on them. Fuck 'em, they're going to get the kicking they deserve.

Moreno is so fast that it can be easy to underestimate how much work he has to do in these situations: run all the way back to track down Mata in some instances, while also breaking forward to counter/press higher up the field.

Luckily I grew up in a family where religion and the sense of conflict in this country were completely unimportant. I never felt any reason to hate others or defend my sense of self.

I had a British passport as a child. I now have both British and Irish. I use the Irish one when travelling. The main reason I would now say that I feel Irish is that despite living in the UK I feel like I have much more in common with a man from Cork than a guy from Essex or a girl from Galway than a scouser. I  think that the people from the Shankhill would actually feel the same about people from the Falls and vice versa if they actually got to know each other.  

I love Ireland the island. I think it is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. I love the people and the culture. I love the music and the beer. That is as far as my sense of nationality stretches. I like being Irish in the same way I like being a Star Wars fan. It's just something that's there that I don't think about very often and that isn't all that important to me. 

When it comes to sport I'm much more of a rugby fan than football. I love watching Ireland play rugby and I think it's a fantastic thing that the whole island plays together peacefully. It bothers me that some Northern Ireland football supporters make people unwelcome. I don't know if I would want to support a team that has an exclusionary fan base. 

I really don't understand the idea of getting so fired up about your nationality that you want to hate or do harm to others. It's just not that big a deal to me.

* Wembley and Stadium MK the only possible destinations at this stage. The move away would be for one season  
  
* Possible amnesty to ST and on loyalty points regarding move away  
  
* THFC again confirming they had no issues with standing areas in the new stadium and would be very willing to build that in should legislation change   
  
* THST also raised the question of singing areas in the new stadium. THFC were in favour of this  
  
*  The impact of the stadium project on future transfer budgets was raised. A certain percentage would be ring fenced and impact would be minimised as far as possible  
  
* Naming rights for new stadium still under discussion  
  
* THST explained ticket prices had already increased by 700% in the past 15 years and with a share of the £5.14bn domestic TV deal, it thought any proposed rise in pricing was unacceptable   
  
* The possibility of a testimonial for Michael Dawson was raised. It is possible  
  
* THFC’s transfer comfort zone was with younger players around the £10-15m price range

Again, no person of any age can make an ""informed decision"" as age has no implication of how ""informed"" or not you are on a given subject. I know 12 year olds that have greater knowledge of British history than UKIP MP candidates. Does that make 12 year olds better at making ""informed decisions"" than UKIP candidates?

&gt; Getting married at 16 with parental consent is a personal decision and doesn't affect the UK population

A single vote doesnt affect the UK population, but lots and lots of votes do. Just as lots and lots of young marriages would affect the UK population. Be it through increased wedding industry activity or a large increase in younger mothers.

Mark reads Jesus' comments on cleanliness ('Nothing that goes into someone from outside can make that person unclean; it is the things that come out of someone that make that person unclean' Mk 7.15) as sweeping away all culinary restrictions: 'Thus he pronounced all foods clean', Mark explains (7.19).

Romans 14:20 Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgement on himself for what he approves. But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.

Romans 14:14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.

So according to church tradition, Peter and Paul taught together in Rome and founded Christianity in that city. Eusebius cites Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth as saying, ""They taught together in like manner in Italy, and suffered martyrdom at the same time.""

null,false,thecavernrocks,null,null,null,"I think you underestimate the effect of depression.  It makes you into a different person.  If severe enough you shouldn't be held accountable for your actions, even though I'm sure a lot will hate you and want revenge.  Like if a mother gets post-partum depression and kills their child.  Are they a sociopath?  No, the reality is that depression isn't just feeling sad.  It can dramatically change your actions and behaviour to the point where it is no longer you.  Like that fungus that makes ants kill themselves, or the parasite in fish that makes them kill themselves.  Their brain is taken over by something else.  Not all depression is like this.  But it can be. It can destroy any empathy you once had for others.
 
Also sociopathy (which isn't really a thing in psychiatry, it's more a hollywood term that isn't used in medicine) is something you're born with.  Killers may be sociopaths, they may not.  Saying this guy must be a sociopath kind of misunderstands mental illness.  He may well have been a sociopath.  He also may not have been.  But his actions in crashing the plane does not automatically make him one.  It is far more complicated than that.  
 
But yeah people seriously do not seem to realise what depression can do.  It can literally make you do things that aren't you, that you never intended to do, and if you survive and recover you don't even begin to understand your previous actions and feelings because they are completely alien to you.  It controls you.  
 
I'm not saying if the pilot survived he should have been just set free.  He obviously had very severe issues that needed medical help.
 
It's just that it's very easy to use him as a scapegoat movie villain ""oh he's a sociopathic killer who wanted to take as many innocent lives down with him"".  It simplifies it, makes him into the evil enemy, makes it seem like he wasn't just the average person, that it couldn't happen to you or me or your mother or your uncle or the nice guy at the off license who gives you a free lighter when you buy fags or your best friend who abhors violence and could never hurt a fly.  He was an average guy with deep issues.  
 
And glossing over that means fewer people get treated before tradegies happen.
 
Like I said you may be perfectly correct.  Maybe he was a sociopath.  But him crashing a plane is not evidence of that either way.  Psychiatry is complicated enough when you've got the person in a chair in front of you, let alone trying to do a post-mortem diagnosis.  
 
By the way if it seems like I'm having a go at you I apologise.  It's not meant to be like that.  I love discussing this kind of thing and rarely check and edit a reddit post as if it was an essay.

Firstly, as mentioned elsewhere, these coastal towns primarily rose to their peak as holiday destinations. With the rise of lower cost flights and the like, fewer and fewer people brought in tourism cash.

Second, the towns themselves did little to adapt to this reduction in income. They are often still very tourist-oriented and cannot drag themselves away from it.

Thirdly, the rise of the big supermarkets and shopping centres. Why spend a busy afternoon walking up and down the High Street when you can get everything in one place just a little drive away?

All of these feed off each other and form a downward spiral. I moved away a decade or so ago, but I still have friends and family down there and the job market is pretty horrific. The High Street has had some investment now but there's still lots of empty shop fronts, and the seafront still tries to be a tourist destination.

You can say austerity is off the table if there's not commensurate taxes on the rich to close the deficit (since I know Cable is a deficit hawk). The Tories don't have a majority, so you have that power. You walk out the room, the government falls. That's what coalitions do. 

Then you don't get what you want either. You have to concede some of your policies if you're entering into a coalition. You 'don't have that power' because you push too hard and it isn't worth to the other party. If they 'walked out and the government falls' then the Liberal Democrats would have gotten the blame for trying to make everything off the table. The Tories could call another election. You yourself mentioned the possibility:

&gt;  If they'd kept a strong grip on the Thatcherites and dared Cameron to call an election, they might have done well. 

Except how would they have done well for refusing to make any concessions despite finishing third? 

David Laws mentions this is the scenario the LibDems were terrified about. Getting seen as immature and unwilling to be practical. The end result would have been voters flocking to Labour or Tory as the LibDems prove incapable of coalition. 

&gt; Stopping Theresa May from scrapping the HRC is hilarious to claim as an achievement when they could have entered a coalition with Labour, which wouldn't have tried to scrap HRC at all. 

The combined totals didn't add up. That's why Brown wanted a coalition of the left which would have involved every left-wing party but many viewed this as impractical including many in the Labour party. Entering a coalition with Labour was never really a viable move.

The reason it's entirely relevant is that there's an agenda at play. The Telegraph wants the Tory's to win. A number of the signatories on that list want the Tories to win. A great many of them are Tory donors. Several are Tory peers. There are also known tax avoiders and non-doms on that list. We expect these people to be pro-Tory and anti-Labour. It isn't news that they are.

So to suggest by omission or inference this group of 100 individuals, cherry-picked by a pro-Tory newspaper, in any way represent the 5,000,000 business owners in the UK is risible.

You truly are the pinnacle of intelligence.

Why not, I don't know; restrict migration from outside the EU and continue to be a part of free movement of labour/services/products within the EU?

From a tiny office in Harrow, it has grown to a 300-strong enterprise with its head office in Berkhamsted and a manufacturing facility in Luton.

&gt; Bristol Laboratories is one of the UK’s fastest-growing manufacturers of generic medicines. Its products, which treat for conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and depression, are distributed widely through pharmacies and the NHS.

Except the majority of people (including myself) see need for a ""political union"".

&gt; We shouldn't restrict immigration from the rest of the world. We should be able to pick and choose who comes here. Like the Australian points system.

Exactly my point, except I want to keep access to the EU. I want an Australian style points system imposed on people coming in from outside the EU.

&gt; The rest of your points are irrelevant again as you still haven't been able to explain why the colouring books are not propaganda.

Why does that matter? UKIP makes propaganda with every poster, the British government makes propaganda with every BBC article, why is propaganda inherently bad when everyone uses it?

You old people are hilarious, keep the laughs coming grandpa.

&gt; If UKIP or the conservatives had a colouring book your kind would scream your heads off.

UKIP and the conservatives have propaganda all over the internet and TV and newspapers. Just as the Lib Dems and Greens and SNP do.

Please tell me why its a bad thing to promote your ideology?

Of course you inherently see the EU as bad, but that isn't a good enough argument. You have to argue *why* the EU is bad.

Which is tough when people like you have no idea what the EU actually does.

&gt; And that EU video, imagine if it was UKIP supporters coming together to oppose the other developing countries. It was racist and you know it.

Neither low prices or guaranteed sunshine are deal breakers to me. There are also quite a few places in devon and cornwall that meet my criteria, a lot of them seem to be doing quite well where the traditional sea side towns just down the road are falling apart.

I think fundamentally the issue is that whilst different people want different things, no-one wants the traditional British sea-side resort. I actually think it will figure itself out eventually.

Quran (2:244) - ""Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.""
Quran (2:216) - ""Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not."" 
Quran (3:56) - ""As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.""
 Quran (3:151) - ""Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority"".  
Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward."" 
Quran (4:76) - ""Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…""
Quran (4:89) - ""They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."" 
Quran (4:95) - ""Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons.
Quran (4:104) - ""And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you suffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain..."" 
Quran (5:33) - ""The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement"" 
Quran (8:12) - ""I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them""

While your opinion on the subject is clear, you do not need to miss-represent my post. I did not say they were not allowed to have an opinion.

And I am not naive. There are, as always, legitimate concerns that should be addressed by Geologists, Ecologists, and Engineers rather than medical doctors whose expertise has nothing to do with Fracking or anything else in the Oil Industry. 

Please do not conflate my pro-facking opinion to naivety, it is rather insulting. My own opinion, is that Fracking in the UK will not take off simply because of Geological constraints. To be specific, fracking is only economical on shales between 2000 ft to 4000 ft depths below the surface. And a lot of Great Britains shales are not within those depths. There are other geological reasons why I think fracking is not going to work. 

Hydraulic fracturing has been used in the UK since the 1980s, and was developed in the 60's. It is a process that has been used and perfected over decades and only now has their been a stink kicked up about it until now. 
As you will most likely ignore my intent, please let me assure you that does not mean I am suggesting we let it go unchecked nor unregulated. 

There, an educated opinion. From a Geologist.

I think you're making the right choice. I ""went to uni"" because it was what was expected of me, and I chose a course without really knowing what I wanted to do. In fact, I chose it based on what my A-levels suited me for and then narrowing it down by excluding courses I *didn't* want to do, which is stupid.

I would have far preferred to get a job straight out of school and spend two years in a widget factory while I decided what the hell I wanted to do and *then* applied to universities. As it is, I wasted a year getting bored at university, another year not going to lectures and just lazing around. I then worked for way less than the current minimum wage for a few months before finding what was effectively an apprenticeship. I've spent the almost twenty years since then in the same industry, and in my particular niche am a well-known respected expert.

Apprenticeships can be brilliant.

And FWIW I love to read and signed up for an OU literature course a coupla years ago. I abandoned it because reading *for study* is so utterly divorced from reading *for pleasure*. It reminded me of the first time I was exposed to Shakespeare at school. We read plays, and wrote about them and fuck me were they dull. Later, and with a better Eng Lit teacher, we acted them out in class, reading from the text out loud. It was bloody brilliant. Shakespeare wrote for performance, not for reading.

2. Then you were going on about fascists, forgetting UKIP attracts many from the collapsed BNP and EDL. Self confessed fascist organisations.

3. Then you talked about propaganda forgetting that any sort of promotion of ideology is propaganda i.e. political posters/adverts.

Fascism emphasises the unity of the nation state, or the people, against those outside the nation state or the people.

The irony being that UKIPs position on emphasising British people over other people (as far as supporting discrimination against non-British people in areas like employment) has much more in common with fascist ideology than the European Union. Now, before anyone jumps down my throat, I'm not saying UKIP are literally fascists.

No, but that doesn't really change the fact that the vast majority of people in Europe still strongly associate the symbol with the Nazi party. Seventy years later and in Europe it hasn't been reclaimed by the people who use it properly yet. 

The word jihad and the Nazi swastika aren't anywhere near comparable in the cultural impact they have had on the people of Europe, but it doesn't really change the fact that the vast majority of people in Europe have probably never heard the word used outside a discussion about terrorism. Even the people who appear in the media to defend it are usually terrorist sympathisers like cage, which just helps to muddy the water even more.

I'm not a Muslim, and I don't particularly care if the word is reclaimed or not (and I don't really think it can be), that's their business, but they should, I think, be sensitive of the impact a word like that can have on the people around them.

The Randian objectivist ""libertarianism"" promoted by the american republican party and increasingly by the tories and the unionist parties is a horrible idea and must not be allowed to come about without all the necessary regulatory systems, checks and balances being replaced by social contracts.

That can, and I believe, will be a slow process that decentralises government authority down to individual consenting collectives. As I said, I'm anti-state, my ideal is a system with the bare minimum of centralised authority, I am however all in favour of things like a guaranteed minimum income and a welfare net, so of the available parties the policies I prefer are actually those put forward by the socialist parties. My problem with them is that they are not against centralised power and therefore, as history has shown, the centralisation of power increases when they are in government.

Again, torn on dzeko. he was crucial in both years we won the league, esp last year with aguero and jove injured + negrado swooning following that shoulder injury. he is an underrated ST, agile for his size and when he is in form, he is a downright terror. However, he is an extremely streaky player, who hasnt been in form all season. he is 29 now, not getting any younger, and lots of teams are interested in buying him, along with jove.

idk. one is going to go. i feel jove will leave, and although i dont want it to happen, i think it would be too much of a gamble keeping him and selling dzeko, esp if we plan to offload otherss. it will be a sad day when the news breaks over one of them leaving either way.

False premise. In the UK British Muslims are afforded all the rights and privileges of any other citizen, the 'alienation' and 'persecution' angle is the favourite narrative of the Islamists themselves, well, that and the apologists on the left.

&gt;If you do understand and respect this then you're going to bring so much hatred upon us that we'll never have peace. If a man has nothing but his religion and you try and take it from him, he will find a teaching to defend his murder.

Priceless. Create a false dichotomy, based upon a flawed premise, and then find a way to blame non-Muslims for the violence they suffer at the hands of Muslim extremists. The violent perpetrators are thus absolved of responsibility for their actions; for they no not what they do.

Of course, he's mainly an attacking midfielder, not a forward.. he'll probably never be the type to score 20+ goals a season... it's harsh judging him on that.  




&gt;But honestly has he had more of an impact this season that Henderson or Coutinho? No. He hasn't

That's very arguable, he's had as much of an impact as Coutinho really especially considering he has been thrown around by Rodgers like a rag doll and the fact that Coutinho didn't get going until December (seems most people on here forget that..)

&gt;Obviously I'm sad he's going because he's a good player. But we could bring in a player better than Sterling in plenty of areas.

From his perspective, he probably feels he has been dragged through the mud by all the media attention and I guess it just got to him. I mean, the fellow must be bombarded from left, right and centre with all the 'greedy' stuff, so I suppose he/his team felt something had to be done. 

Seeing as he seems to have shifted the brunt of criticism from the money demands to his commitment to Liverpool (or lack thereof, to be more precise), I doubt this will have the desired effect, particularly in terms of appeasing Liverpool supporters. 

Personally, I felt it would have been more prudent to stick with the 'no deal was offered/rejected - I just want to focus on the football in this crucial late stage of the season' line, but it is what it is. 

I'm not going to say 'he's gone' because there have been far longer sagas and far greater rifts that have been repaired - Tevez, Rooney and even our very own Luis Suarez. So he could well stay, at least for another season or two. 

I'm also not going to blame him or accuse him of being Judas. He has stated his priorities very clearly: he wants to win things and suffers from no club loyalties. Fair enough, understood. 

But as a supporter and therefore someone who helps pay his wages, I can't help feeling a bit of disappointment and hurt, however irrational this may be.

HMRC  describe tax avoidance more or less as paying less tax in ways that weren't intended by Parliament. In many ways this is a terribly unhelpful definition, because who knows what parliament was thinking?

In a lot of cases it is obvious, simply because many avoidance schemes are so blatant and so abusive no intelligent person would think it was intended. Don't look me in the eye and tell me you thought you were trading in used cars when you neither bought nor sold a single car.

Leaving the abusive end alone though, I have no issue with you paying less tax, when it's all above board. You took a dividend instead of a salary, reducing your NICs and tax? Good for you. You claimed every penny of every relief you're entitled to? Likewise.

Christianity does not have an emphasis on martyrdom in the way Islam does. That is patently untrue.

A quick google:

http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Themes/jihad_passages.html

Countless references to slaughter via Jihad - or 'religious struggle' (whichever interpretation you wish to take on its meaning).

Google definition of Jihad:

jihad
dʒɪˈhɑːd/
noun
(among Muslims) a war or struggle against unbelievers.
""he declared a jihad against the infidels""
ISLAM
the spiritual struggle within oneself against sin.
noun: greater jihad; noun: greater jehad; plural noun: greater jihads

My advice is ... well... wait and see and when they finally catch up tell them you cannot afford the payment in one lump sum and want to set up a payment plan. I think they have to by law if you're going to be in hardship to meet the payment... but you'd have to prove the hardship with copies of you bank accounts, income and outgoings AFAIK. Maybe an emergency credit card and then transfer the balance to an account with 0% on balance transfers for the fisrt x months. 

Perhaps check out the forums on money saving expert.

My advice in the meantime is start saving towards that £600 and keep the extra £50 each month as savings. Worst case scenario is you have to pay it, best case they don't notice when you eventually close your contract with them.

&gt;Its also as if the IRA never existed when making these comparisons.

I've lived here in NI during the troubles. I assure you I haven't forgotten.

The IRA is a political organisation that fought for a political purpose and uses religion to divide, but has never made religious claims as part of its core doctrine. In NI, 'Catholic' is more of a culture (like in America) than a religion.

ISIS and al-Qaeda are religiously motivated. They draw their inspiration and doctrine from Islamic scripture, not a political movement.

They use politics to achieve their religious goals, not the other way round.

They **are** different, and not comparable.

Using the IRA as an excuse for Islamic terrorism is tired and debunked.

&gt;Well maybe that's something worth actually discussing.

And that's what I *am* discussing, that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with core western beliefs- you know, the title of the thread!",null,0,null,1427911964,null,0,false,0,cpy1cd5,null,t3_30vndr,null,t1_cpy1cd5,null,t1_cpy0yaw,null,null,null,1432139884,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

He's 20, it's easy to see others winning loads of trophies at city, chelsea, madrid, etc and then see Liverpool struggle to consistently make Champions League. 

If Liverpool finish outside of top 4 this year I expect him to go. It would be terribly disappointing and I'd expect him to get much less playing time elsewhere than here for the foreseeable future. However, it sounds like his biggest priority is winning trophies. 

That's likely why he would have signed a new contract last year - Liverpool came ever so close to winning the league. As much as I hate to admit it, Liverpool is a multi-year project right now, I don't see them seriously challenging for the league or CL for two or three more years at least. Even making top 4 is proving very difficult to consistently achieve.

this is the problem with all these studies. Higher immigration from places in eastern Europe undercuts the lowest earners, people that struggle through as Kitchen porters, shop assistants, and labourers, this allows for employers to get people who are willing to work for less for a longer time, that improves profits and is a net gain for the economy.

The reason why immigration helps create new jobs is because forces younger people to train to higher levels, this is why you know need more qualifications to work your way up through labouring that what an accountant needed twenty years ago, having a better educated workforce means more business can compete. In the long run everyone wins. (Immigrants are unlikely to work their way up, but their children are born as full British/Irish citizens and have no language barriers, or gaps in education.)

Everyone wins except for the typical Belfast scally who spent 10 years doing dishes for minimum wage before someone was able to undercut her wage. someone who is incapable of retraining and is unable to find work because she cannot remain competitive, and has to spend the rest of her life living off the state.

This is why countries that have recently started to attract more Immigrants are having knee-jerk reaction racists, because as much as immigration helps a country, it does it replacing people who already struggle.",null,0,null,1427912425,null,0,false,0,cpy1mmk,null,t3_311hdq,null,t1_cpy1mmk,null,t1_cpy0rbc,null,null,null,1432140020,null,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10,null

To be entirely honest if you love to read, where's the problem with reading a lot for a degree? I've had to slog through some tedious books in my time, but you never know when a title might surprise you by actually being enjoyable.

I'll be right up front about this: If you can't be arsed to finish a degree, what makes you think you'll have enough Give-A-Fuck to work a high-wage job? It's not all sitting at a desk then knocking off early while you earn a six figure salary; actual work has to get done, and often this means rocking up at 7AM and working 12 hours, then meeting clients at the weekends. Wife and kids? Be impressed if you ever see your children before they're old enough to stay up past 9PM.

So it all comes down to: Why English? What do you want to *do*? Do you want to write? Teach? Cook? Edit? Do you want to be CEO of a multinational Tech giant?

There's not a whole lot of office work I can think of where an English degree would be the right way forward, unless you're aiming to be an Editor at Random House or something. And there aren't a whole lot of jobs which naturally come from an English degree which you couldn't do equally well without one - I know many writers, for instance, who wish they'd never wasted 3-4 years on their degrees because they were of no use when it came to writing in the real world.",null,0,null,1427913157,null,0,false,0,cpy2389,null,t3_30y8cq,null,t1_cpy2389,null,t3_30y8cq,null,null,null,1432140237,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

It's unfortunate that Sterling feels the need to defend himself against the greedy comments.

If (a), the most important thing is to remove any sharp or blunt objects from the vicinity. The second most important thing is that you'll need a large bottle of gin - at least a 1 litre bottle per episode, as it is vital to pre-load (min. 250ml an hour before the episode starts) in order to mentally prepare yourself. During the programme itself, anywhere from between 300ml to 500ml gin should be imbibed, with the remainder following the end of the broadcast. You may use mixers if you wish, as long as the same amount of *neat* gin is used.
If wearing mascara, ensure a handy supply of cotton wool pads in order to reduce damage to the furniture.

If (b), make sure you have a ready supply of joyful paraphernalia - what these may be depends entirely upon your own personality/mindset/experiences, so think carefully - perhaps a CD of The Sound of Music, or an animated gif of kittens chasing a dog. Whatever your choice, you will need a minimum of at least 16 different ""pick-me-ups"" per episode. Do not be tempted to re-use the same item more than once per episode as the effectiveness will be reduced. The goal here is to skirt around the event horizon, not be pulled into to the black hole. Alcohol may be consumed, but care should be taken. On no account should gin be considered. A nice calming cup of tea is the preferred option for this scenario, as it will ground you and remind you how lucky you are that you've never been electrocuted by a faulty kettle lead. The idea behind this is that since none of the characters on the programme have ever suffered this fate - yet - there is a larger chance that this will happen to one of them rather than to you.

2. Because of his role as CM, goals and assists are never really going to be his thing. His job is more to unlock defenses, get the ball to the open man who creates the play (think Modric to VdV link up). It's not fair to judge him on those stats similar to how people don't judge Toni Kroos or Luka Modric on the goals/assists they rack up. It's just not their duty to play the final ball to the striker or bang in a goal - yeah its nice when they play a gorgeous long ball or hit a nice screamer, but those are rare.
