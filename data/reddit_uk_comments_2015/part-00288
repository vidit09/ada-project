Roma have one non-EU space and they were hoping to fill it with Salah, however because of Salah's ongoing dispute with Fiorentina I assume they've decided to cut their losses and pursue Rahman instead.

That's the point of microdosing. Take it at night, the EPO can be undetectable in your system by morning, and since we're not going around waking athletes up in the middle of the night for random drug tests (and fair enough) then it'd never get detected that way.

I'd actually prefer a slightly less left-wing candidate than Corbyn, but there's nobody like that in Labour - just old guard Socialist Campaign types and soulless New Labour types. Labour can win by going centrist, yes - but not by aping the Tories. What people are missing here is that every time they capitulate to the Tories, they shift the consensus (the Overton Window) further right. Eventually they'll reach a point they're just not prepared to go to, but the Tories will - and Labour will be obliterated.

Against the top four we're gonna get a bunch of shit calls that may lead to some goals and heartbreaking finishes. Everton and Rodney Dangerfield have one thing in common in that we don't get any respect. Under Moyes and Martinez first season we punched above our weight. Bobby's second season was phenomenally shambolic as we underperformed in the league but looked lethal in Europe till the away game in Kiev. After we were eliminated we climbed the table to eleventh but were challenging for the top half of the table. 

It's hard to say where we are going to finish as many of the teams who finished above us have had a very good summer transfer window. I would like to think we have talent ready to break into the first team from the u21s but that's what I thought last season and Martinez hardly rotated the squad. 

The most important thing for the team is to add depth to the team with a few more transfers and to keep Stones as our CB. I don't like this talk about him going to a ""bigger club."" There is no other place where he will get more playing experience than Everton and I would like the team to make a statement of holding on to its best players in order to challenge for the top four.

Parliament and the iconic buildings of government could still remain for the use of the offices of a Ministry that for one reason or another should remain in London.

Aerial ability. You what? Since when does heading play a part in being a good DM? never has and never will. It's a bonus if you can but its not part of the job. Defenders challenge for balls on goal kicks not DMs.

Lovren won't make a good DM because positionally he's crap. If you can't play cb in a back 4 you've got no chance in playing DM having never played there before.

Playing CB in a back four is as easy as it gets positionally, your only job is to keep shape and organise others. Even if you are absolute tripe you'll avoid being a liability by doing just that.

Northern Ireland will never work as long as it lags behind the rest of the UK, and that will continue as long as it is expected to keep up with the rest of the UK despite trying to recover from 40 years of near enough civil war.

null,false,xtremity,null,null,null,"Firstly, let's be realistic here. Not all universities are equal and not all degrees are equal.  Clearly University of Bolton isn't offering the same academic rigour as, say, Durham, even though it's charging almost as much.  When the government introduced fees capped at £9,000/yr it was inevitable this would become a target rather than a maximum limit. 

The traditional universities are going to offer better value for money (in terms of after graduation prospects) if you are studying a ""traditional"" subject such as a STEM field like Physics or a humanity such as Classics.  It is likely that most of the teaching staff will be involved in research and can be expected to be at the cutting edge of their respective fields.

Conversely, for more vocational subjects you can be better off studying at a former polytechnic.  These often have excellent links with industry, which means they teach skills employers want, and the staff are less likely to be career academics and have some real world experience.  

As far as extra-curricular activities are concerned, most university towns have more than one institution.  Students who attend the (ex-polytechnic) UWE in Bristol have access to the same night life as your sister.  Sure, they will have separate unions and societies but they both go to the same places to eat, drink and socialize.  So your issue appears to be less a case of ex-poly vs uni and more a matter of where you chose to study.

If you are really unhappy at your current choice you could look at transferring universities but you will have to meet the entry requirements for the course and institution you want to transfer to.

Plus, why would he want to break up the bromance?

To be honest, I think in a few years when Ivanovic's age catches up to the point where he can't be a first team starter, Jose will look to buy another CB that can play as a RB. I think he loves the tactical advantages that Ivanovic gives him, by being able to attack and put good crosses in the box, an additional aerial threat in both attack and defense for set pieces and open play, and flexible in that when he isn't up there attacking, he can cover Fabregas's position when he's farther forward.

Grantland wrote a great column on Ivanovic's versatility a few months ago, and reading that made me think that Jose will look to replicate him and his role on the team (although his replacement probably won't ever be as good).

Forget all that chicken and rice stuff everyone's posting. 

Get toast right, get the cans of stuff in tomato sauce and heat them up (ravioli, canned bolognese, beans &amp; sausages, those cans of all day breakfast, etc).

Boil eggs, bake potatoes, do packet rices and pasta &amp; sauce packets. Mess around with bacon - see if you prefer it fried in a pan, under the grill or ovened.

Don't be afraid of failing, just have a pot noodle on standby.

Here's my idea of basic recipes to impress:

Bolognese sauce - pack of mince, fry until brown, add tin of tomatoes, basil, garlic - doesn't matter if the basil and garlic are fresh, dried or whatever, just add them. Leave it on a low heat for 10-20 mins, checking and stirring every now and then. Taste it. If it's boring - and it will be - add salt &amp; pepper in small increments until it tastes better. Dump a few pinches of sugar in too. It makes the tomatoes less bitter. When it's less water and more sauce, it's done. That shit can go over all kinds of things - chips, pasta, toast, baked potatoes....

Thai Chicken Curry: Yes, it's easy. You need a chicken breast each, can of coconut milk, some form of hot chilli - fresh, flakes, paste, whatever, lime juice and fish sauce. Cut the chicken up into bitesize pieces, dump everything in a pan together (just a few splashes of fish sauce and lime juice and as much chilli as you can handle) and wait. Again, when it's saucy, it's done. Taste and adjust as you need. Don't have the heat too high, you don't want to burn it. Another one you can have with all kinds of things.

WINGS! Seriously, just get a pack of fresh chicken wings in, get a bottle of marinade, slather the wings in the marinade and shove them in the oven, gas 7, for half hour. Done as a done thing. What the hell is easier than that?

STEW! Forget dumplings, they're annoying. Get some gravy granules, a bottle of Lea &amp; Perrins, a bit of curry powder, four different veg (pick from spuds, carrots, onion, swede, parsnips, peas, anything else that you think would stand up to three hours boiling without dissappearing to mush) and a pack of stewing steak - not the tins, they're vile. Cut everything into bitesize pieces and dump it in a large pan full of water. Add enough gravy granules to make the water brownish, dump a good glug of lea &amp; perrins in there, along with a teaspoon of curry powder. Leave it on the lowest heat, cover and leave it for an hour. Come back, see how it's doing, cover back up, leave for another hour. It's done when the meat falls apart when you pick it out and the gravy tastes good. Add little bits of salt &amp; pepper to make that happen.

Get the very basics right, THEN move on to chicken and rice and all that other stuff they're all posting.",null,0,null,1438041824,null,0,1438042885,0,ctie8yv,null,t3_3enumi,null,t1_ctie8yv,null,t3_3enumi,null,null,null,1440124088,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Because that means 60% of CRIMINALS are getting shafted and the profit they would've made is instead going to reputable individuals and the government. Isn't that a good thing?

Not to mention you glossed over all of my other points. Individual freedom - the freedom for a sane adult human being to do whatever they like with their own body, so long as it does not harm others - is in my opinion a human right. If I want to take some plant I found, prepare it into a joint, and inhale that shit into my lungs then who are you to stop me - even if that plant may be harmful to my health? It's not harming anyone but me, and I'm consenting to the harm, so really what business is it of anyone else's? You may say ""don't do that, it's bad for you"", and that's fine, but ultimately it should be up to me what I put into my body. If I want to smoke tobacco, and increase my risk of lung cancer a thousandfold, that's my choice. If I want to drink a substance that is literally poisonous to the human body - alcohol - that's my choice. If I want to eat junk food until it's coming out of my flabby ears, that's my choice. All of these are extremely harmful, arguably moreso than cannabis use, and yet we are free to partake as we please. So, I ask you, why is weed illegal in the first place? Why do we say ""you can do these things that fuck your body up, but not this particular thing that fucks your body up""? Remember that while alcohol poisoning is a real and often fatal condition, nobody has once in recorded history died of a marijuana overdose. 

But I get it, you want to see *benefits* of legalization, not just some wishy washy liberty stuff. OK, well what about prison expenses? There's a shitload of people get jailed for weed that would no longer get jailed for weed if it was legal. This means LESS PEOPLE IN PRISON, i.e., LESS MONEY SPENT ON PRISONS, i.e. MORE PUBLIC MONEY AVAILABLE FOR OTHER SHIT. Put it this way, would you rather your taxes went to provide food and accommodation for some dumb stoner twat (and if it's legal, perhaps groups like 'Cannabis Addicts Anonymous' or something will emerge - and chronic users can get support to quit without fear of going to prison), or would you rather it went towards something far more worthwhile - the NHS, perhaps, or education, or any other public service you can name. So in addition to the ENORMOUS tax revenue legalizing weed would bring to this country, you would also have the massive savings on prison expenses. That's gotta count towards something, right?

The whole ""driving under the influence"" thing - if you look at the graph, you see it goes up from a tiny green sliver to a slightly larger yellow sliver. Now, I really can't be bothered searching for the data they used to make the graph, since I'm on mobile and the source they cited was simply ""data from Denver Department of Safety"", but using a screenshot, a pixel measuring app, and a calculator I deduce that it's an increase of around 30 DUIs. That's WAY less than the year on year fluctuation of alcohol DUIs, in other words, it's negligible. Seriously, when over 1500 people per year get pulled up for drink driving and only around 40 for high driving, that points to a *serious* alcohol problem, not a weed one.

I'm not trying to argue that there are no downsides to legal weed. Of course there are. There's downsides to everything, that's just a fact of life. Of course when you make something legal that was once illegal, a few curious people will hop on the bandwagon and you will get more users. (not all that many, though - weed is so easy to get a hold of in this country, even if you're under 18, it's ridiculous). What I am arguing, however, is that the benefits far outweigh the costs. The way I look at it is, people are going to smoke dope regardless, isn't it better the government gets its cut?

You obviously haven't been around football for very long. They're one of the worst out there when it comes to circlejerking something. For example the ""Costa crimes"" bullshit last season. 

Previously, they've been heavily biased in favour of SAF and Man UTD. This article exemplifies their BS: When you don't want to blame a club, blame the player who just left the club and signed for a title rival. Does it come as a surprise that this article gets released on the day that Di Maria rumours circle around the club? I mean virtually every player they signed last season didn't work out. It was almost as if the management and the coach had no synergy and they just signed players because they had money to blow. 

Note how the article states ""Falcao was **robbed** of possession by Terry"", but during the post-match discussion they couldn't stop pointing out that it should have been a foul. Now this Adam Bate guy is citing this particular example as to why Falcao is a gamble? Also citing Neville for emphasis because he is their most respected sports personality now. Then goes on to say that you should never judge a player based on one game. No shit Sherlock. I mean if this fellow really thinks that Jose Mourinho is going to blow millions of pounds on a player based on one game's performance, you have no business writing a sports article. His whole argument lays on the fact that Jose said he thought Falcao was good when he played vs us. 

All I see here were cheap tricks to grasp ever harder at those metaphorical straws. lol @ Availability Heuristic.

I think we'll put in a genuine challenge for Europe, barring major injuries. Seven of last year's top ten in our first set of games doesn't help, but hopefully we can lay down a marker, and a win against Liverpool at the end of September could see us go on a great run.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

Either Jagielka or McCarthy, almost certainly. Obviously, Lukaku will need to contribute the firepower up front, but someone needs to keep the back four steady. We almost made the CL in 13-14 on the back of a phenomenal defense, and that needs to continue.  Jags is probably one of the top five defenders in the league, and certainly top ten. McCarthy, while he doesn't score much, provides a crucial role shielding the back four, and covers limitless amounts of ground. We need the engine in the midfield, and he always gives 110% on the pitch. Our performances were notably poorer when he was injured last year.

**How do you think the team will line up?**

Barring major injuries, the team will probably look [something like this.](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=856t)

An increase is an increase. Even one more person on the road at risk of injuring my daughter is no good as far as I'm concerned.

As to the question of economic confidence and personality characteristics to outperform Ed, I feel that no matter which candidate is chosen he/she needs to be more assertive in confronting the common narratives espoused by the tories. If Corbyn is capable of that (or any candidate) I don't know. Is there one in particular you feel would be the best choice? 

Personally I have not yet  had an in depth look at the 4 candidates. I do feel however that saying Ed Milliband lost because he was too left wing is unfair. However I think people had the perception he was much more to the left than he really was, which is a shame. Is there any policy Ed had you feel was particularly left wing?

&gt; Individual freedom - the freedom for a sane adult human being to do whatever they like with their own body, so long as it does not harm others - is in my opinion a human right.

That's why I highlighted the point about driving under the influence. This is a perfect example of why marijuana does endanger others.

False dichotomy. We can stop jailing people for possession (didn't we do that ages ago in the UK?) and do all sorts of things (rehabilitation programmes instead of prison) without making the drug legal. Just because I'm against legalisation doesn't mean I think everyone should be banged up in a Victorian prison system.

And the toxic stuff they need to vote down is in the third reading, which hasn't come up, not the second reading. And also - the tax credits thing *is in a different bill altogether*.

So this whole thing is about a) people who don't understand how Parliament works being gulled into attacking their own side and b) people saying ""we must vote against the minimum wage rise because the Tories are for it, so it must be bad"" and c) people thinking you can change the business of a majority government, when you haven't got the votes.

The last is the most important bit. Most people's experience of Tory govt was actually the Coalition, which could be wedged apart on occasion (like the Syria vote). But a majority govt will get *all* it's business through unless it's own side rebels - and they weren't going to rebel on this issue.

That means that attacking Labour and saying that ""opposition"" matters more than electability is an exercise in futility. You can scream and you can holler, and you can run naked down the mall, and you *still* won't be able to stop the bill. 

The only way to stop it is to get into govt and repeal - and every time your supporters say ""getting into govt is not important, screaming and hollering is"", that recedes. Think about that when you next complain about the Conservative govt. How long do you want it to last? Ten years, Fifteen years, Twenty years, Twenty five years? At some point the penny will drop that you need to get into govt and hence you need those floating voters in the centre. Hollering is not enough.

The extra man in midfield at the very least didn't create a 3 v 2 situation in the middle like we had all season, and with the man in front of him, Yaya's positioning wasn't as poor. 

Completely agree about Fernandinho though. He really is a box to box player, and that type of player shouldn't be paired with Yaya because two players who stray forward will eventually be exploited against top European sides. I think thats why Fernando was such a huge disappointment because we desperately need a quality anchor. Its gone down hill ever since NDJ.

I think Fernando will come around and have a very good season this year, but we should still be looking for another holding mid instead of another box to box player like Pogba imo. Either way, a 4-2-3-1 could cut it in the Prem, and maybe even Europe if Fernando/another holding mid is paired with Yaya. Regardless I think De Bruyne is crucial to winning major silverware.

The requirements of these positions are extremely different (yes, they're both defensive but thats where it ends). It's no good to just look at things like passing amount or lengths because the requirements of each position are completely situational. I would imagine if you compared their passing statistic 'under pressure' vs 'not under pressure' you would see a massive difference. For years people were arguing that Agger should play CDM, and now it's happening with Lovren. These things don't happen (if they do it's extremely rare) - the requirements of each position at this level are extremely unique both tactically and situationally. Rodgers would have to teach Lovren a huge amount of stuff about tactical movements and movements without the ball in this position.

null,false,sjampen,lfc99,,null,"I think our planned transfers is about finished. We've replaced Brad Jones with Bogdan, Gerrard with Milner and added to our offensive depth with Ings, all for free. You could add Origi to the Ings part too.

We then replaced a very weak Johnson with Clyne and Sterling with Firmino and the expected growth of Ibe. 

Finally we added young talent to our weak defense in Gomez and added the striker who we lacked without Studge in Bentekkerz. 

That seems like it might be what we've targeted before the window. Filled the holes of significant players leaving, then improving our squad, sometimes both at once. 

One could argue about the LB, especially with the Digne rumors, but Moreno was just bought last summer, Gomez looked good, theres a Flanno to consider. A LB makes sense, but theres also an argument to be made for patience and sitting on the cash. 

One could argue we need a CDM. Theres an argument for that, especially if someone REALLY wants Lucas and overpays. On the other hand we have Can and BR doesn't seem to be that fond of playing a CDM. 

Finally, theres an argument to be made for a goalkeeper or what I would categorize as a star signing that really gets us closer to Chelsea. In a perfect world we'd look at some central defenders too with Skrtels and Kolos age, Sakhos injuries and Lovrens suckage, thats not pressing and we've spent money on CBs. 

Right now I think we're in the reaction faze. We're exploring if theres a good deal to be made(Digne or maybe a young talent), we're waiting for other teams(Sales of Lambert, Borini, Enrique etc.) and whether something happens that commands our attention(Lacazette or Reus handing in a transfer, or some team replacing player we have interest in request for instance). 

If the window were to end, I think we'll be satisfied as of right now, but that can change with sales or injuries. Adding to this, theres never a transfer budget, thats not really how it works. If Reus spoke tomorrow and begged Liverpool to sign him, it would be about finding a price we would pay, not a straight no because we already spent out transferbudget. If PSG said we can have Digne for free if we pay his salary, its not gonna be a straight no because we've reached our maximum wagebudget. Its not FIFA/FM where theres a set number pr season. Each situation will be attended to individually, and thats where we are now. Satisfied, but waiting, monitoring and working on the slow moving things.

null,false,MrLiamD,newcr-6,,null,"**How do you think this season will go?** I think we'll be somewhere between last season and the one before. I predict around 60 points putting us around 7th-9th. If we can remain relatively uninjured then possibly better, if we get fucked with injuries possibly worse. A semi-final in the League or FA Cup is certainly possible. We were mainly making defensive errors (especially when Stones was injured) and lacking pace in attack, I believe if Stones and Jagielka can remain fit we'll kick a lot of the defensive errors and see a defensive record similar to that at the end of the season, and with Deulofeu we have that urgency. If he and Mirallas play regularly Lukaku and Barkley will benefit greatly which could lead to some impressive performances. If we see the phasing out of Barry for slightly more creative midfield presences like Besic and Cleverley then we could be a lot more dangerous. So yeah, 60ish points and a decent cup run.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?** If he stays I see a fantastic year from Stones, he'll prove he's the future of England and hopefully Everton but more likely Chelsea or United down the line. With the new service I wouldn't be surprised if Lukaku has a great year, scoring in the late teens in the league. 

**How do you think the team will line up?** I see a lot of chopping and changing, I would like to see this line up but I think it's more likely that he'll have at least one defensive winger and/or a more defensive minded midfielder next to McCarthy, but hopefully we'll see this against some teams that are more likely to sit back;

                          McCarthy

Inbound, a DM to partner Bentaleb. This was needed before the window opened and now with Stambouli, Capoue, Paulinho and Holtby all gone it is required even more so. A Bentaleb injury would put our midfield in a pretty dire situation at the moment.

Outbound, one (preferably Ade) of our two under performing strikers. Ideally both by the end of the window but that requires at least one striker coming in, which is perhaps too much to get done.

I believe they still use the same call center and it wouldn't surprise me if not much has changed since the company changed hands but I can't be certain and it has been some 5+ years since I worked there, so take the following with a very large pinch of salt.

One of the targets we used to have to meet was known as 'friends and family' where you ask the patient if there are any friends and family you can take the number of so that their system can make an automated call to potentially worried family and friends so that they are temped to phone back the bedside at an incredibly inflated rate (I think 50+ pence a minute).  

The system should give you the name of the patient that is trying to get a hold of you, the fact that it hasn't suggests to me that it's possible someone who hasn't met their friends and family quota for the day has just input random phone numbers into the system and one of them happened to be yours. If a patient had phoned up to register themselves on the system, the phone call you receive would have told you their name. A nurse can phone them to register them on the system without giving a name however they cannot give out numbers for family and friends in this case.

If you don't know anyone who is likely to have been admitted to that hospital there is probably nothing to worry about.  If you do know someone who has been admitted to the hospital you are much better off visiting them or waiting for them to call you from their bedside phone because the rates for calling them are criminal.",null,0,null,1438051137,null,0,1438051567,0,ctijqvg,null,t3_3erlz9,null,t1_ctijqvg,null,t3_3erlz9,null,null,null,1440126744,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Sven Bender. I don't know much about Kramer or I imagine I would pick him from what other Spurs fans have been saying. However, Bender seems like he could slot in nicely next to Bentaleb and at the same time would not be irreplaceable. Solid player for a few years maybe allowing Alli to develop and slot in next to Bentaleb eventually.

Honestly is there anyone we haven't talked about? I'll go with Julian Green. Because it will excite American's to hear his name again after he fell off the face of the earth when he went to Hamburg.

Also, your figures are off by quite a bit:

Labour alternatives received a fair whack of a technically unionist vote. What you're doing is looking at voting patterns through the eyes of someone in 2015, when these distinctions didn't exist as unionism was already the dominant ideology of the time. Its fascinating that if we look at that same election you point out, nationalist cities like Derry were electing unionist representatives when they previously didn't. Lets look at where nationalists gained sats - border counties and the north-west, excluding Derry itself, a majority nationalist city at the time, and that overall as you say... 59.12% of votes for the UUP turned into 69% of seats going - a bit disproportionate considering the demographic makeup of the state at the time.  Are you telling me that nationalists with unequal rights to employment and housing were voting UUP? I find that highly unlikely. Histoic gerrymandering has been widely accepted for the past 20 years at least, if not much longer as these things were well pointed out at the time. 

Unlike you, I don't engage in revisionism to atone for past grievances, the civil rights movement happened for a reason; if the circumstances were different and nationalists were afforded the same rights as unionists, we probably would never have seen a civil rights movement as those grievances would not have existed. So you're talking out of your hoop. I have little time for propaganda, unlike you I've actually done my homework. 

&gt; Are you really that dense to think the troubles would of happened if the Ira didn't exist.

I'll ask again - lets go back to the 1960s... who set off the first bombs, who killed the first RUC officers?

No they weren't. Foyle was held by a nationalist since its creation(1929-72).

&gt;59.12% of votes for the UUP turned into 69% of seats going - a bit disproportionate considering the demographic makeup of the state at the time

Keep in mind the nationalist party got 8.4% of the vote and got 17.31% of seats. All first past the post parliaments are disproportionate. Thats why theres few left in europe. In this case it benefited unionists and nationalists.

&gt;Unlike you, I don't engage in revisionism to atone for past grievances, the civil rights movement happened for a reason; if the circumstances were different and nationalists were afforded the same rights as unionists, we probably would never have seen a civil rights movement as those grievances would not have existed. So you're talking out of your hoop. I have little time for propaganda, unlike you I've actually done my homework.

You have lots of time for propaganda. Your facts on the Northern Ireland Parliament are wrong. Londonderry had a nationalist MP. There wasn't gerrymandering at the Northern Ireland Parliament and the facts are there to show it. Nothing more than republican propaganda would claim otherwise.

&gt;I'll ask again - lets go back to the 1960s... who set off the first bombs, who killed the first RUC officers?
The UVF, who had reformed years before the PIRA had even been a consideration, remebering that the actual IRA at the time refused to do any fighting (hence the phrase ""i ran away"")

Do you think it would of escalated to what it did without the IRA?

The Guardian is a *liberal* paper that just happen to give some space to leftists like George Monbiot and Owen Jones. It's news content is pedestrian liberal, not Labour. It's editorial stance is hand-wringing liberal, not socialist. 

It's just that because people like Owen Jones writes for the paper, people think that it's a paper of the left, and then they're surprised when the paper (like it did in 2010) supports the LibDems for government.

null,false,axbosh,null,null,null,"Maybe I can offer you a slightly different perspective. 

I won't try and get into the questions about whether it is possible to really ""upgrade"" your university. Ex-polytechnics can be just as good as Russell Groups unis in terms of the education that you receive, but the reality is that this may not be the way that it will be percceived when you leave uni. Some places are better thought of than others and, depending on what you want to do, a more prestigious university can be a good choice.

Now my situation: I studied for one year at one university and hated the course. I actually quite liked the city but the course was wrong for me for all sorts of reasons. I was unwilling to spunk another £3,500 for an extra year's tuituion (I started in 2008), and giving up wasn't an option. So I transferred. It was an incredibly easy process - I had to get a reference from one of my lecturers (chose one who I knew liked me) and resubmit through UCAS. The unis I applied to for the transfer were very accommodating and I had the feeling that they were happy to get someone that had already proved (having completed part of one year's study and coming with a good reference) that they were capable of work at a uni level. The only grading requirement was that I pass the first year - not even with any specific grade. 

If you want to upgrade your university then I can seriously recommend this as an option, although there are a couple of things that are maybe considerations:

- I already had the grades necessary to get into the university that I transferred into after my A Levels. They also accepted me the first time round in UCAS, I just went for the wrong choice. 

- I transferred from one Russell Group university to another. The second one was higher rated in terms of rankings and stuff. I don't think that universities themselves will take too much notice of this, however, my observation has always been that universities do not observe the supposed differences between things like the Rusell Group and others, since it had very little bearing on your actually learning ability. 

- It might not be easy to work this all out now, with August just around the corner. However, if you're willing to badger people to get them to reply to emails in August then I can't see why it wouldn't be possible. 

- It did stunt my social life at uni a bit. I had spent a year meeting people in city 1 and by the time my transfer was accepted it was too late to look at moving into a shared house in city 2 and so I ended up back in halls again, without knowing anyone on my course. 

In spite of that, it was 100% the right choice. The course was much better and I eventually did meet good people in city 2, it just took a little longer.

I am just putting it out there that it is not good for you, and therefore increased use would not be good for the health of the general population. I mentioned teenagers specifically because overuse by that age group (and younger, but I'd hope no children are using cannabis) can mess up neurodevelopment and lead to psychosis. 


I also wasn't saying alcohol is not bad, just pointing out that when arguing for the legalisation of a drug it is more useful to compare it alcohol, another harmful drug, than it is to caffeine which is harmless.

Cool.

So Care UK was on the news *again* today for failing to provide services to standard in Suffolk. 

Care UK's former chairman, John Nash, was given a peerage after having donated £300,000 to the Conservative party.

He also gave £21,000 to Andrew Lansley, before he became Secretary for State and Health.

Meanwhile Care UK have picked up £102 million in government contracts.

They got caught evading tax in 2012, and have been caught failing to do their jobs several times now.

What a stunning set of incredible coincidences. This company gives money to the Conservative party, and then mysteriously wins contracts while being crap and dodging tax.

null,false,rustyb0y,null,null,null,"**Do you think this could be a possibility?**

No because CDM is a position that's only going to be used sparingly this season. I expect to see a lot of Milner/Henderson in the double pivot and in the games we do play a CDM Lucas or Can are much better options.  Last season we were forced to move players out of position because our attacking options were diluted and our defence was unbalanced especially when playing 4-3-3. Rodgers then used the 5-3-2 to try and combat this issue which eventually came unstuck vs quality opposition.

**Do you think there is anyway back for Lovren?**

Absolutely, I think a lot of people just focus on Lovren because he's an easy target.  A perfect example was the goal we conceded against the Malaysia XI, it was actually Skrtels error as he was marking Wleh and was caught out of position by the pass.  Lovren swapped to cover but by that time Wleh was in the penalty box so tackling wasn't a great option either, not too mention Mignolet could of knocked it over. It was just a great finish from Wleh.

The funny thing is last season we conceded less goals than the year before even including the 6 goals we conceded on the last day. So technically our defence was better, the real issue is our attack.  The two things we needed to address from last season was goal threat and improving our team balance.  Both of these issues have improved dramatically from last season with the acquisitions of Benteke, Milner, Firmino &amp; Clyne. The fact most of our players are getting a good pre-season in is a huge positive and something you could not say about last year.

Is Lovren a world class defender? No. Is he good enough when the team is actually playing well? I'd say yes.

**Are you happy with the current CDM choices?**

I'd like to see Can playing in that position this season, although I do think Lucas still has some legs and can be used to great effect.",null,0,null,1438068983,null,0,1438069486,0,ctirfv8,null,t3_3es0mu,null,t1_ctirfv8,null,t3_3es0mu,null,null,null,1440130435,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Firstly, it was the mother's own assets, she was lucid and she was justified to change her own will (however petty). It probably didn't occur suddenly in a vacuum. The mother was probably emotionally devastated.

You don't plan your finances ahead that depends on someone dying soon - what if by extraordinary luck the mother lived another 20 years?

Thirdly, she chose to elope with her boyfriend.

I'm all for a bit of positivity in the camp every now and then but if somethings going really shit sometime the best thing to do is deal with it head on and not prick around it, we, the supporters aren't stupid and being spoon fed the same crap in press conferences is not something I want to see next season.

I don't think we've properly addressed other weaknesses from last season, Howard and Robles are not good enough to be our #1 goalkeepers, people say Robles looked decent when he came in, I think he looked shaky as hell and not a worthy #1. Howard let us down far too often last season to be given another shot, confidence breeds from a solid base and he was far from that last season. 

Our squad is a year older and the injury prone players are injured again. I really think it's time we called it a day on Hibbert, Gibson, Pienaar (hasn't been near the same in his second stint with us), as much as I love Osman he's surely on the way out in a year or two and we have no replacement to step in, he does a crucial job, and of course Kone as our backup striker is worrying beyond belief, Martinez needs to be sectioned if he thinks it's acceptable to go into this season as him challenging Lukaku. I'd take Naismith as backup CF but him playing AM last season ahead of Barkley was lunacy. 
The lack of funds that seem to be available again seems to be very worrying. As pointed out the depth in our back line is horrendous. I'm a big believer in promoting the youth team players if they're good enough but none of them got a chance last season and played behind Hibbert for prolonged periods of the season, if we were planning on using them this season we should have blooded them for more than a game each.

If we recognize the benefits that religious schools bring, then we should be trying to emulate their success in other schools.

There is already a scheme in place where top preforming headteachers are brought into less well performing schools to advise them, but to continue with such schemes means recognizing the place of religious schools in society.

My first suggestion would be to review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations. Key aspects are balance, variety, serving sizes. If you already do that you might try anti inflammatory, low glycaemic index and nutrient dense.

Absolutely request referral to an NHS hospital dermatologist, you seem to meet the criteria (not responding to standard treatments, PIE might count as causing scarring although it technically is not). They can run further tests and confirm the diagnosis. It is possible you have more going on than simple bacterial acne vulgaris, perhaps a second concurrent condition or an unusual form of acne that is fungal or related to Demodex mites.

In Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), prostitution itself (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal, but a number of related activities, including soliciting in a public place, kerb crawling, owning or managing a brothel, pimping and pandering, are crimes. In Northern Ireland, which previously had similar laws, paying for sex was criminalised in January 2015.

From guardian but well known fact: 
In the UK it is not strictly illegal to take drugs, only to unlawfully produce them, have them in your possession or pass them to someone else.

&gt;I’ve been accused of being patronising by some of the new idealistic members. Sorry but it is difficult not to be when confronted by naïvety, lack of any campaigning experience, sheer made-up cloud cuckoo land economics and political analysis that I grew out of at about the same stage in 1983, when aged 11, I looked at all the Tory posters in windows on our housing association estate, and first read the 1983 election results and realised Labour under my beloved Foot and Benn was really incredibly unpopular with normal working class people.

&gt;If I’m being patronising its because I don’t want this beautiful new intake of inspired, enthusiastic young members to have their idealism smashed to pieces by another two Tory victories like we had to go through in 1987 and 1992, while the people we are all Labour members to help see their incomes fall, their communities decay and their public services destroyed.

&gt;I don’t want them to have to learn their politics like Bill and Hilary Clinton did in the McGovern campaign in 1972, working their hearts out for a campaign that alienated and pushed into the arms of a cynical crook like Nixon the very blue colour workers the Democrats were supposed to exist for.

&gt;Listen to us jaded old gits that had our youth blighted by Thatcherism.

&gt;Listen to me when I say Mea Culpa I was incurably naive for the last five years thinking Ed Miliband’s beautiful socialist vision might cut it with the electorate, let alone one a country mile to his left.

&gt;Listen when I tell you compromising a bit and winning so you can actually do things for our people and save them from the Tories is a million times better than the purest day of theoretical socialism in opposition.

&gt;Listen to the voters – the ones who were Labour just ten years ago and now laugh at how out of touch we are with their views and their lives.

&gt;But I don’t think they will. I think 20,000-40,000 long term leftists, 25,000 loyal Unite members following the line, and 60,000 fresh out of the box idealists, plus the mad sectarianism of some Labour right wingers refusing to use their second and third preference votes for less than pure Blairite candidates will do it for Jeremy.

Then followed up by this.

*Mrs Jackson made her last will in 2002 with a letter to explain why she had disinherited her only daughter, referring to the fact she had walked out of her home in 1978 to live with her boyfriend.*

So it appears they did explain why they did not want their daughter to inherit but are we then adding an additional caveat to that of the judge having to like the explanation?  As far as I can see they did not explain their connection to who they did leave their money to but if you leave everything to animal charities what are you really going to say as an explanation beyond I like animals.

So it depends on the course and the university.

English Lit at (ex-Poly) Southampton Solent will be much less rigorous than English Lit at the (Russell Group) University of Southampton.

But for certain vocational courses, there may be ex-polys with unbeatable reputations, as good in that specific field as any of the older or more prestigious universities.

Sure you need a card in some states but who hasn't got back pain?  
  
This is a totally different country to the D.A.R.E obsessed America of last century, it's a totally different media and political landscape. There aren't any major ideological opponent to legalization any more, even that Catholic church barely opposed decriminalization in Italy so now Italians will so be allowed to grow up to five plants. 
  
The only argument against legalization is collective welfare, something the current government don't really care that much about - their platform is austerity over community. In strictly economic terms legalization could be a real money spinner for the government, it allows them to reallocate police resources and tax the billions spent on weed annually - there is no increase in hospital visits or crime associated with legal weed, in fact the general trend s a decrease in both. Socially most studies have pointed  towards prohibition causing far more problems than it solves, it creates a distrust in government among the youth and a distrust and dislike of police which expresses itself in popular culture. Organised crime is largely funded by drug dealing profits, criminalizing someone for trivial things has been shown to make them more likely to later commit more serious crimes, etc... 

There are no significant outside forces pressuring a continuation of prohibition, most of both America and Europe are far in advance of us in terms of legalization, internally there is no serious opposition to legalization and there are no strong arguments against it. No one stands to profit by prohibition yet many will profit by legalization. 
  
Of course they're not going to wave their ceremonial mace and make it fully legal tomorrow however they could take steps towards decriminalization of home growing and formalize the statements made by the CPS and various local police forces that they'll turn somewhat of a blind eye to small scale growing or possession.

It really doesn't matter too much that you no longer live there, given that your mum does and she passed the summons on to you. The fact that you've moved out, and your mum now lives there alone, is irrelevant. It's also irrelevant that your new property with your girlfriend is licensed.

Bottom line - you committed an offence, and admitted it to the inspector. Your only real option will be to attend the hearing, explain that you'd just moved in (with evidence if possible), and that you immediately bought a licence for that property (again, bring evidence if possible such as bank statements or similar) but you've since moved out, and your new address is also licensed. Alternatively you could ignore it all, allow the hearing to proceed without you and then contest it afterwards on the basis you weren't properly served, but I doubt you'll be better off doing that - the TV licence people could just institute fresh proceedings at your new address (which you'd have to supply to the court to contest this hearing). You're likely to be convicted and fined, but the fine will likely be a low amount (£100-200) because you immediately bought a licence and you'd only just moved in.

It's in the balance. We are currently short of centre backs, with one of our two senior defenders being constantly hassled by Chelsea, but with defensive reinforcements and no Europa League, we are more likely to replicate 2013/14 rather than 2014/15.

If he stays (I'm sure he will) John Stones will be crucial. Gerard Deulofeu could hopefully offer the spark and selfishness that Everton desperately needed last season, instead of just passing it around in midfield endlessly, but our season will depend on Romelu Lukaku getting back to his terrorising best. He looks fit and confident, all we need to do is supply him.

Laws don't just emerge from the basement of Westminster as fully formed as bills for the MPs to vote on. They are based on months of consultations, written, re-written, passed to lawyers to check for consistency with existing law and to check they're not going to open up new loopholes or something.

That work is done in no small part by MPs. They spend whole weeks sat on committees hearing testimony from ""stakeholders"", subject experts, legal advisors, etc - during that time they won't be sat in Parliament having debates that won't lead anywhere.

They're writing the next law for people to vote on.

Similarly, ministers have other jobs. The defence minister might show up to *vote* on a new drugs law, but not to argue the toss over a report at a Thursday afternoon debate with no motion or division - he can read the report at his leisure. In the meantime, he probably has a stack of meetings and paperwork at the MoD to deal with.

I am member of the Liberal Democrats. I join about 8 months ago, got involved in campaign with my local group and also stood as a candidate in council election coming third. 

What made me join the LD over other parties (apart from being a Liberal) was that they were welcoming, fun and do continious all year campaigning so there is always something to do. 

The other big thing is that being a member of the LD I get a direct say on which policy the party inherits at there conference, the members get to vote on policy, the Lib Dems seem to be the only party that do this, and I think that it is great. Plus you can go to conference and anyone is allowed to speak, even on the big stage! 

The best thing about joining right now is its a exciting time for the Liberal Democrats which you can make your mark on. We have a new Leader with new purpose, we are not divided between left or right, we are collective seeking a better fairer society, and supporting civil rights, but we are open to different views and opinions. 

We are a rebuilding party, a party of opportunity.

Here is something Tim said on his speech: 

*So lets together make our liberal voice stronger.*

*If you care about human rights join us.* 

*if you think you shouldn’t have your emails snooped on join us.* 

*if you think everyone deserves a decent home join us.* 

*if you think its wrong to demonise immigrants, the young, the poor, foreigners, Brussels, the English, the Scots…join us.* 

*If you are fed up of self-satisfied politicians ambitious for themselves and unambitious for their country… then guess what?  You are a liberal.  Embrace that diagnosis.  It is an utterly decent and British condition.  So join us, join us today.*

It doesn't happen without warning or notice!

&gt; Edit: Any MP that is that closed minded about an issue that they aren't willing to attend a debate on it shouldn't be able to have any say in it whatsoever.

It's not about being closed minded. Let's say the Defence Minister has a busy week of meetings with Generals, MoD Civil Servants and NATO Officials. He will be briefed on the new drugs law, and will turn up and vote, but he probably can't commit 8 hours out of his working week to sit through a long debate and final reading - and some of the big Bills literally do take *hours and hours* to get through - they'll be read, have amendments proposed, voted on, accepted or rejected, read again, ad nauseum.

Other matters are literally so specialist or purely administrative that most MPs have nothing to contribute - a special finance bill regulating something very specific.

Its just a rollercoaster of fun. I mean the more you put in the more you get out. But you meet great people as well.

Honestly one day I spent in the office putting letters in envelopes, but it was great because I was there doing it with friends and for a good cause even though it was boring.

We have a few Hotels, the [Malmaison](https://www.malmaison.com/locations/dundee/) is probably one of the best. Right in the City Center and near the water too. There is the [Apex](http://www.apexhotels.co.uk/en/hotels/dundee/apex-city-quay-hotel/?gclid=CNjtypfL_cYCFYbItAodFY0JFg) also. 

Just be mindful that there is a lot of construction down at the waterfront area especially where the Malmaison is located.  


We also have a decent shopping center (The Overgate) and we have a Project Pie here too if you get homesick, and depending on when you are coming there might be a FIVE GUYS as well.

He actually used the term Blairites for Corbyn, fuck me. This article managed to be more condescending than the Tories for Corbyn one.

 I'm honestly glad he didn't sign up as a full member because honestly I wouldn't want someone who clearly has so much disdain for what are supposed to be his political allies, having a bigger say in party goings on than me.

Not all opinions are equal. The considered opinion of someone with a PhD in Genetic engineering is generally considered to be more worthy (when considering relevant genetics topics) than someone who is scared about what they read on the Greenpeace website.

None of that takes place in the Commons.

Unless 12 Evertonians and a Hobbit band together to go and reclaim the Sky TV gold from Bill Kenwright, I believe this season will be largely disappointing. Everton are once again set to miss out on an opportunity to build upon a potentially great squad of players due to ineptitude at board level. This season will most likely see the club swim around the top half of the table, throwing rocks form afar at the teams that have spent enough money to achieve European qualification. The lack of creativity in the final third will be grossly evident and the lack of real competition for Romelu Lukaku will lead to lacklustre performances from our £27m striker. Martinez will play players wildly out of position, repeatedly praise the squad in the face of heavy defeats, and try to play tiki-taka with the likes of Steven Naismith on the pitch. Everton's tactics will resemble a game of Pass-The-Parcel in which the music never stops while Martinez masturbates furiously over each meaningless sideways exchange.

&amp;nbsp;


**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

John Stones - he's my favourite Everton player and I'm pretty sure he's yours too. He is one of the few players who brings me genuine joy whilst watching Everton so I imagine he will be sold soon.

&amp;nbsp;

**How do you think the team will line up**

Gareth Barry in every position with Steven Naismith on the left wing.

Either Tories are the worlds worst political strategists, or Corbyn actually does worry them. I happen to think Tories are good strategists, so I think if they truly thought Corbyn was a disaster, they would STFU and let it happen.

The reason he potentially worries them is he is taking on a sort of ""movement"" style status. Ask the people voting for him, the thing they mention most is his personality, not his policy. They like someone who isn't a politibot like Cameron &amp; Miliband et al. He answers questions up straight, he gets pissed off at people, he is showing he is actually a real person. The others in the race, and the people he would face in a GE, are all just politbots running slightly different firmware. Burnham and Kendall? Give me a break, two complete robots who make sure whatever they say offends the least number of people.

The Tories are a bit unsure about how that will play out. They know people are sick of politics as it is today. So they are going nuts on the ""ELECTION WILDERNESS"" narrative because they don't want to see what will happen. If they really did believe it, they would just quietly let it happen.

I'm defending a system that does no harm from someone who wants to see it torn down because they simply *dislike it*. You cherry pick the points I make to suit your argument and conveniently ignore the rest. For example I see you've casually ignored the point that for every kid sent to private school there's more money spent per kid in a state school because the privately educated kid's parents continue to fund the state education system. You've also casually ignored the likelihood that even with private schools abolished the best state schools will be monopolised by the wealthy by pricing the poor out of the housing markets around them. Do those two very real problems just disappear in your utopia?

&gt; Great, so wouldn't these children flourish even more if they were given something approaching the resources afforded to the privately educated? Don't they deserve the same, or more similar, opportunities after their academic achievements which are afforded to people who are academically mediocre but have the right tie?

They do, and you've yet to explain how forcing rich kids into state schools will magically solve the problems faced by those schools.

The main pressures facing state schools are class sizes and dealing with kids from deprived backgrounds who have switched off from the system and don't see the point in education.

Your plan will *increase* class sizes and effectively reduce funding (more kids in the schools, no extra cash) and making rich kids sit in the same room as poor kids for 6 hours a day does *nothing* to solve the social issues creating the problem kids. How does a rich kid fix their broken home life? Their lack of respectable adult role models? The crime rate in their neighbourhoods?

You're **repeatedly** ignoring the real problems in the name of ""fuck rich kids they shouldn't get their own schools"". 

Riddle me this: how do rich kids in schools fix social issues outside of it that they've got no control over? They can't.

&gt;No, you're removing the right of the rich to a lifeboat away from the majority of the population. If the richest, the most influential in society, believe that they have no stake in public services then they aren't going to care whether or not they are defunded, but if they have to use them then they will ensure that they are better than they are now. In any case, it's not very good or healthy for people to deliberately exclude themselves from the rest of society, it's demeaning to both the children of the rich and the majority and dehumanises both in the eyes of the other.

Way to go painting an entire demographic as money-grabbing and insular. Only good has ever come of things like that.

Addressing the actual point, you're avoiding it (again). All you're doing is attempting to dilute social problems by throwing rich kids at it and (I still don't get the logical link between these) assuming that where ever rich kids go, problems disappear. 

I'll tell you what happens where rich kids go: poor kids get priced out. Happens *everywhere*, not just schools. What's your solution? Assigned housing to every citizen and assigned schools that balance demographics?

&gt;I don't see why the existence of other inequalities mean that this inequality is more justifiable.

You're using a supposed injustice to target one particular thing that you personally dislike while ignoring the rest. You've blatantly got an agenda against private schools in particular, not against wider injustice. All you seem to care about is this *particular* implementation of the injustice, the rest isn't important to you: as long as the hated private schools can go!

&gt;Why would any of these, uncosted a la what you accuse Corbyn of gasp, changes happen when those in charge of implementing them send their children to their private school lifeboat?

Vote in someone else, then. That's what democracy is for. Currently the British public seem rather supportive of the idea that people should be more self-reliant and that the state should be smaller.

Convince them otherwise.

All you hear about these days are sexual offences (current &amp; prior), drug offences, terror-related arrests and so on. Now, I am *not* saying I think the Police should focus more on those. But if that is the overall public consensus, that we need to find child abusers more than robbers, then surely that's what they have to pursue? They must act for the Public.

Personally, and this is a controversial opinion, I think many things the police are currently focusing on should be shifted to other organisations. I believe sexual offences should be dealt with by an umbrella organisation consisting of serious internet crime experts, medical treatment experts (paedophilia is a psychiatric condition), and child protection experts. It should be independent from the main Police force, which I believe should be about being an active deterrent of crime. If there is evidence of active, on-going child abuse then of course this can be referred. Or we could give the power to prosecute to this umbrella organisation.

If we could move to a system where paedophilia was [dealt with similarly to Germany](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33464970), drugs were legalised and regulated properly, the Police would have more than ample time to deal with violent crime such as rape, burglaries and even terror offences.

It's a thing I've been doing for a few years now, for a variety of nationalities, but this was my first group of Bahrainis.

So, you've got an all-female cohort of well-educated girls from families wealthy enough to drop around £3k on a two-week language crammer for their little darlings - at least one family had sent three kids! - but although they are cosmopolitan in outlook they still come from relatively strict Muslim backgrounds from an authoritarian andrarchy. Consequently you have this weird mixture of affluence and material wealth combined with uniformly covered heads and legs and an unquestioning acceptance of the gender segregrations typical of the Persian Gulf monarchies. There was also a lone Saudi girl in the group, who was equally charming and friendly, but I find myself wondering whether she will be permitted to drive by the time she is an adult, or to leave the house unchaperoned?

null,false,TOSH2345,null,null,null,"As a woman in London I can tell you thats exactly how it works here don't worry, we just have slightly different terms for it. We generally call it 'seeing' someone, as in you'll ask your mate 'are you seeing anyone at the moment?', its just causally dating until you find someone to commit too. Then dating is a full on relationship, so you can probably see where the confusion comes from.

Generally you don't talk about seeing/dating other people, unless someone asks, but then theres nothing wrong with asking anyone. Usually though people ask just before committing as a way of getting an feel for whether you're interested in committing. But I know people who would happily ask you with no intent, they're just more open like yourself. 

The reason for not just coming out with it, is that it would be interpreted as you keeping your options open and so not interested in whoever you're on the date with. Having a chat about people you're dating is a thing friends do so its a sign that you might just want to be friends. We tend to be more passive aggressive in the way we use language, so it could be taken as a subtle hint that you're not interested. 

Watch out for that when dating, most guys here (and girls probably) won't come out and directly tell you they're not interested unless pushed, preferring the slow fade/ghosting. So if your date starts talking about other girls he's dating - without you prompting, then it should be taken sign that they just want to be friends.

Personally, I like the Cybermen more than Weeping Angels. Much, much more. 
I think the Cybermen of the newer series have lost a lot of what made them terrifying in the Classic series. Now they are emotionless robots with brains but way-back-when you could see that there had been people inside those machines, and the fact they had done it to themselves. There are still hints of it here and there but I did hate the Cybermen in their latest appearance since they were [Series 8 spoilers](#s ""basically Ironman"").
I could say the same for the Weeping Angels, really. The original concept was interesting but it got diluted as it went shopping until other episodes.

But, I'm getting off topic. 

There is a reason that the big three, Daleks, Cybermen and the Master, return so often: those enemies are easy to sell. People like those enemies. Certainly in Britain there was a period of Dalekmania that saw the Daleks arguably outgrow the show. Everyone knows the Daleks, and the Cybermen, and the Master so they don't require any in-depth introduction when they arrive on screen.
More than that, Daleks bring audiences in. They are a very, very popular enemy and can make a lot of money from merchandise. And a lot of money is always helpful for the production team. 

I think having one Dalek episode a series is maybe *too* much, but most other episodes feature new creatures and concepts, or rarely used ones, so it doesn't bother me all that much, it does balance itself out.

To clarify, the key criticism is it's a rotten great big straw man.

A couple of points:

1. Statistical analysis is a tool but it is not proof of something, merely an indicator correlation. Causation is different. That's where experiment and propositional calculus comes in.

2. That's a statistically invalid point. Sure the chance of a singular event is possible to compare as they are independent but overall risk is aggregated.

(b) the SNP will be promoted from thorn in the side to the closest thing resembling an opposition as Labour dissolves into infighting and schism, and the Tories would rather have a coherent one nation party to debate, to shut out every debate the SNP wants over further devolution, powers for Holyrood, English votes for english matters etc.

(c) Tories4Corbyn. The Tory high command may not want to weigh in on the Corbyn debate precisely because they might push more support towards Corbyn, but hundreds of ordinary members have gleefully signed up ""to consign Labour to electoral oblivion"" as one put it.

Not if you are planning on declaring an illegitimate referendum and then staging a coup. How much of the public actually support the idea is somewhat more relevent than an election result with 50% turnout.

&gt;the system is what it is

And in that system Westminster is sovereign and the Scottish government has no power to declare independence or even hold an official referendum without Westminster's approval. The exact scenario you are talking about is the SNP acting outside of the system.

&gt;You think David Cameron, the man who won 15% of Scotland's vote and 36% of the whole UK, is going to argue that the SNP don't have electoral legitimacy in Scotland just after they win a majority of Holyrood seats?

Yes, because his victory was perfectly legal election with a long established voting system. *You* are suggesting that the SNP have the right to hold an illegitimate referendum and then use the result as a basis for a declaration of independence.

Tories are irrelevant as Labour had majorities. A view to how Labour stepped down over the welfare reforms recently tells you that opposition action is often PR damage limitation. The liberal media machine was in full swing and the good times were rolling in the build up to 07/08. Tory reputation was in tatters at the time. 

The problem is not less regulation or more regulation, the problem is good regulation and bad regulation.

Labour shattered the existing regulatory system into three pieces (FSA/Treasury/BoE), ensuring that communication issues, turf wars and bureaucracy got in the way of regulating the City. Previously it had been centralised at the BoE.

The real tragedy of this whole crash was that the real crash came as a result of systemic correlations via the CDS market, which fractured Labour regulation created a loop hole for. AIG only needed to post 3 executives to London, to oversee the mushrooming of the CDS markets insurance of the subprime bubble that was otherwise banned in the States.

It's also worth reading just to see how much the BBC have mangled the reporting of the case.

1. It was never contested that the daughter was entitled to the money. According to Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975: ""Section 1 of the 1975 Act confers the right on, among others, a child of the deceased to apply for an order under section 2 of the 1975 Act if the will of the deceased or the intestacy rules do not make reasonable provision for her.""
2. The mother had no connections with the charities she chose to leave the money to in life. This fact was referred to in the judgement as ""common ground"" meaning disputed by neither party.
3. The daughter and the mother were estranged, the court were not able to determine either party to be overall at fault for the estrangement (""responsibility for estrangement is difficult to quantify""), but the mother was referred to as acting ""in an unreasonable, capricious and harsh way"" towards the daughter, and furthermore had an ""inability to make lasting relationships with anyone""
3. The father, Mr  Jackson, ""was killed in an accident at work about three months before the appellant was born. His employer made a substantial payment to Mrs  Jackson  which she used to pay off the mortgage on the home""

In short, the mother was a bitch, a good part of the estate was made up of money paid due to the father's death in an industrial accident, the mother attempted to leave all the money to charities she had no connection with (inferred to be basically to spite the daughter in death) and the daughter had a legal right to some money from the estate.",null,0,null,1438083016,null,0,false,0,ctiuz3s,null,t3_3evbqt,null,t1_ctiuz3s,null,t3_3evbqt,null,null,null,1440132101,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

My R35 was actually the 2nd production model in the country, I was working for RiDE at the time and sorted the review bag for Tim Thompson (editor at that time) and having seen the quality I basically bought mine then and there. 

The R30 is the pack I use most as its waterproof and good for laptop and gym kit and as the first and only do everything pack for a new rider is probably the best balance of size and function.

Got a link? I went looking but couldn't see anything, and I'm interested in those polls.

&gt; Labour party supporters are more interested in demonstrating their commitment to leftist values than they are about getting into power. 

How did Tony Blair win? By running against a hugely unpopular Tory government on a platform that was not too scary for disaffected floating centre/right voters, and without demonstrating total contempt for the left. He inherited a motivated core labour vote and added a layer of right-wing palatability on top.

However, that ultimately ended up completely alienating the core labour vote. This strategy slowly destroyed Labour over 3 terms in government and they are bleeding their original core to other parties, and to the ""not bothering to vote"" bloc.

Labour has to build an identity distinct from the Tories, *before* attempting to also annex the centre ground. It cannot win by *only* occupying the centre.

The problem in a nutshell, and why Corbyn is going down a storm: all the pundits are talking about how to win, which comes across as empty and devoid of any principle worth voting for. Corbyn is talking about WHY, and that is striking a chord with people that have walked away from Labour in the last 15 years.

There is essentially zero chance of Labour winning the next election - Tory boundary changes and a strong SNP see to that. The only hope is a broad, left-wing coalition and to achieve that will require someone willing to unashamedly work with the SNP, and stand by arguments that that is a good, progressive thing rather than run from them or demonise them or equivocate to placate the right-wing press. 

If that happens, we may get a commitment to electoral reform, and if THAT happens then we might finally get some representative government in this country.

null,false,Iceglaade,missy,Missy,null,"I'll guess that you're watching the series mostly through binges (and at least certainly not with a week between any two episodes!) It feels like they come up a lot more when you watch in that way because when you normally watch it weekly then it might be 10 weeks from Dalek episode to Cybermen episode, but for you it might be only a few days. But statistically, it's really not that bad: (these are the episodes which have Daleks and/or Cybermen as the primary antagonist, e.g. The Pandorica Opens wouldn't be listed here).

Series 1: Dalek, Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways

Series 2: Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel, Army of Ghosts/Doomsday

Series 3: Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks

Series 4: The Stolen Earth/Journey's End

2010 Specials: The Next Doctor

Series 5: Victory of the Daleks

Series 6: Closing Time

Series 7: Asylum of the Daleks, Nightmare in Silver

2013 Specials: not really applicable

Series 8: Into the Dalek, Death in Heaven

Thus there's really an average of one Dalek/Cybermen episode per series (1.375 to be precise counting two-parters as one story), occasionally none, occasionally two. Personally I think this frequency is perfectly appropriate since the above list counts for Daleks and Cybermen episodes *combined*, and iconism gives them leeway to use them occasionally like this. In addition, many of the above listed episodes have other plots as well as a Dalek/Cybermen story.

Also, there are 11 stories listed above, and somewhere around 100 plots in general, which says that about 1 in 10 stories will feature the Daleks and Cybermen.

&gt;Again, Martinez has been forced to deal with players potentially leaving, not arriving. It started with Seamus Coleman and Ross Barkley in June, and has moved onto Mirallas, James McCarthy and John Stones in July. Everton are spending so much time making sure the plug stays in the bathtub that there is little left for adding more hot water. The result is an inevitably lukewarm experience.

Aside from bs newspaper articles where is your source on any of this? This is our squad. These are our players. 

And Naismith is a much better player than you give him credit for. Barkley was having an off year and losing control of the ball too much to make a positive difference. 

&gt;Without simplifying things too much, it's the bit in the middle that's lacking. Martinez might be angry to see Stones leave, but to claim that Everton can keep all their best players is fantasy. Ask Southampton. Ask Tottenham. Ask Liverpool, even. Martinez seems to prefer the 'Buy high, sell rarely and never sell your best young players' philosophy to the one previously mentioned. It's totally unrealistic.

Why is it a fantasy to expect us to keep our best players? Tottenham sold Bale for €100 million but he wanted out. Sterling wanted out from the Red Shite. Your argument holds no water as Stones has said he wants to stay at the club recently. 

Why is it totally unrealistic to keep our young players we develop? Especially with all the new money from the television rights coming in it seems like times have changed a bit. This should be the model. Develop your own players just like Southhampton, but hold onto them so you can climb the table and challenge for the top 4. Southampton is just too small a club to hang on to its best players right now but has a great academy that is the envy of the league.

Because this isn't a householder case, (because you're simply defending property) force that is disproportionate in those circumstances will not be reasonable. In the above case, you could probably justify pushing them out of your house.

&gt; can't block them in till police pay attention

Actually, you could if you made an arrest under [section 24(A)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. 

This allows any person, other than a constable, to arrest someone who (amongst other things) he has reasonable grounds to suspect is in the act of committing an indictable offence. Theft is an indictable offence, as is burglary. 

There are some conditions for the arrest to be lawful; namely that it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a constable to make it instead, and that one of the four criteria below are satisfied:

To prevent the person in question—

(a)causing physical injury to himself or any other person;

(b)suffering physical injury;

(c)causing loss of or damage to property; or

(d)making off before a constable can assume responsibility for him.

Point (d) will do nicely here. Once again, section 3 of the Criminal Law Act is your friend here, as it allows you to use reasonable force to effect an arrest.

Once the suspect had been arrested, you would have to phone the police, tell them you had arrested the suspect and hope they arrive in a reasonable amount of time - anything longer than, say an hour, would be verging on false imprisonment.

When the BBC began UK broadcasting, the record companies introduced a system called needle time, which meant the BBC could only play about five hours of music from records per day. They had many bands and orchestras of their own and hired others, but it was still a limit and of course there's a huge difference between hearing The Beatles and hearing the BBC Big Band playing 'Love Me Do'. The BBC regularly tried to increase it but the Musicians' Union always threatened a total strike (not just refusing to play on the BBC, but refusing to record new records or perform concerts, which terrified the labels). The system collapsed when pirate radio stations began to play records all day long without paying anyone. In 1967, the BBC was given unlimited needletime (and Radio 1 could be launched).

The 1988 Copyright Act [requires the PRS to offer a licence scheme including unlimited needletime](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/VII/crossheading/use-as-of-right-of-sound-recordings-in-broadcasts-and-cable-programme-services). I don't know whether this was a new provision in 1988, but I suspect so, as there were no major copyright acts between '67 and '88. So the current system is not because the PRS is kind, it's because the musicians and their agents fought tooth and nail against using recorded music on radio and TV and the BBC was presumably still worried in the mid-80s that the musicians might try again.

Maybe if we'd had 'pirate TV' to take on Equity in the same way then there wouldn't be all the current difficulties with repeating old TV dramas. Having said that, I do respect the success of these trade unions in fighting for their members. I suspect that there were a lot more paid musicians in the 40s and 50s and the rewards from their labour were spread much more evenly around the industry, instead of lots of people playing for pennies in pubs while a few get made millionnaires by Cowell and his ilk.",null,0,null,1438085632,null,0,false,0,ctivuk0,null,t3_3eub5i,null,t1_ctivuk0,null,t3_3eub5i,null,null,null,1440132512,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

I am selling this fantastic monitor as I do not need it anymore. It looks great and has many inputs. Here is a link to the [product page](http://www.iiyama.com/gb_en/products/prolite-b2888uhsu-b1/).

Games, like BF4, GTA V and Tomb Raider look great on this. 4k is not that hard to run either. With a single 290X I got 40-60fps on BF4 ultra (NO AA), 30-40fps on tomb raider ultra (NO AA) and 30-40fps on GTA V high settings (no AA).
 
It was bought in October for £400 and had a 3 year warranty, currently there is around 2 and a bit years left in that.
I am selling it for £300, with free shipping. Though I am happy for people to pick it up.

£9000/year is nowhere near the full cost of your education; it's the subsidised rate available to Home/EU students. You can normally only get the subsidised rate once. If you leave and re-apply, then you may be asked to pay the full ('international') fees which will be about £13,000-£16,000 for English Lit at a Russell group university. You are allowed to drop out and switch up to a certain date, which in my day was under the control of your Local Education Authority (LEA). My LEA was Tory so we only had six months or so; others were more generous. I believe the new loans completely remove the LEA's involvement, so your first step is talking to Student Finance England to find out the current rules. Likewise, if you have done a BTEC, you may have to pay fees to study A-levels. This would still be a question for your LEA and you should contact your local further education college to ask them.

Tories did not have a policy as they were not in power. They spent the best part of Labour rule, decimated and broadly ridiculed by the nation. They only scraped 2010 in a coalition, despite Brown being widely hated.

With the creation of the eurozone, and low US rate boom driving up markets, Brown looked like a great Chancellor, but he was dovetailing off the back of outgoing Tory policy and external factors.

When the bubble burst, his claim to have defeated boom and bust was exposed as fallacy. 

But yes, stay sceptical of the Tories, and hope the Liberals can come back on the scene once Labour become splintered and irrelevant. Tories need to be held to account at end of day and while they are preferential to Labour any day of the week, anyone can be dangerous when not held to account.

Its quite unusual to be referred straight to secondary services, you would normally be started in primary care, and 'stepped up' if needs be.

Furthermore, he has held no high office within the party which you might argue makes him 'pure' but you need experience to manage cabinet ministers, to delegate and to work things out. Being prime minister is about compromise and hard decisions it is not just about having a position, sticking to it. In order to reach the position you want, you need to traverse events, challenges and people. 

Furthermore, plenty on the right of the labour party (the old right and the blairite right) have indicated an unwillingness to work with him and a whiffs of a plot to remove him. This sort of disunity is very harmful for a party and him having no experience of being a minister, a shadow minister or any sort or high position in government doesn't lend me much faith that he will hold his party together.

null,false,2beer,null,null,null,"It might be easier to estimate if you start on his wages. The wages form the base value of the contract, before add ons, bonuses, affiliate advertising etc. 

For example, if he's on £40k a week basic, multiply by 4 for the month and then 12 for the year, which is £1.9m per year. Then you multiply by length of deal, which is £7.6m for a four year deal. As each year passes, the remaining years form the value, so his value decreases to the club towards contract expiry, even though he will be offered a new deal at a new club on the same or improved terms. So, if he was on this deal at west brom, we would have to first pay the remaining years, and then add that to our offer to him. 

Saying berahino is worth £15m would mean he's likely going to be paid £80k a week-ish. But that is before we've sorted his existing contract. He may choose to waive his remaining clauses, such as handing in a transfer request which means he loses any loyalty bonuses and clauses in order to get the better deal elsewhere. And WB may have sell on clauses of their own which alter his contract value. 

So, if Kane is on our top tier wages, he will likely come in under that for the first part of his deal. I'd imagine Kane is on £80/90k. 

The trouble with this guesswork, and with all transfer speculation on fees, is the contract value is not released to the public at any time as its a private matter. And the sums involved mean a £10k estimate difference to the actual value per week means you can easily be millions of pounds wide of the mark, once you follow out the calculation. So a small sponsorship, or a newspaper column and your miles away from any kind of ballpark figures.

Firstly I its a rebound from the previous quarters slowdown of 0.4% - business had been(supposedly) holding back investment pre-election and so makes sense that there's a slightly higher than trend upswing post-election.

What growth there's been has been nearly entirely the services sector - which is low wage, low productivity and not actually a particularly viable economic strategy cos it relies on discrectionary consumer spending, which in the current environment of low interest rates is being paid for by cheap credit (household debt is reaching pre-2008 levels.) Construction however has totally stagnated and manufacturing has actually gone into decline! Construction (ie housebuilding) is not something the Tories really want in any large number because it could lead to lower house prices (and for all they talk about how much they love market forces they certainly don't want the market to reach an equillibrium here...) and manufacturing seems to be struggling as a result of the mix of a very strong pound and low labour productivity.

null,false,cathartis,null,null,null,"That contradiction between ""equality within a nation"" and ""equality across nations"" goes right to the heart of Green politics.

It's difficult to tell developing countries ""you cannot use the fossil fuels that made us in the west so rich"". How can you say to a peasant beggar in Bombay ""your nation cannot have things that will help it to develop"". And yet it's also very hard to tell people in developed countries ""you must use fewer resources"". Vote for us and you will have less stuff.

Western Green thinking on economics comes across as too fluffy. We want less inequality. Good start. But what does that mean? For many ordinary poor people, less inequality means workers being better off - being able to run a car, buying the latest games console for their kids and taking a holiday to Spain every year. We can't promise these things to millions and still be serious about cutting resource consumption. 

At the heart of of the current UK economy is finance - the City. Many of the activities of the city are extremely predatory. It's hard to imagine any future Green government being compatible with the continued dominance of finance in our economy. But we the financial industry shrinks, can we give any guarantee we can replace it with something else? So the nation is worse off.

Ordinary voters aren't stupid. Well some are. But many aren't. And they are only stupid in some ways. They might not think long term. They may not believe warnings from scientists. So in that way, yes, they can be pretty thick. But when the right wing press say ""if Greens get in power then the economy will be wrecked"", then it makes sense to them. And they are probably right. Any government serious about cutting resource consumption will make us poorer. To some of us, that's a good thing - we make sacrifices now for the sake of generations to come, as any parent makes sacrifices for their children. But others, who pretend there will be no sacrifice, leave themselves wide open to being called unrealistic idealists.

Going back to the original post - in my opinion the points about inequality go right back to the philosophical concepts behind nationhood. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes viewed nations as a social contract between people, who work together for their mutual betterment. That's a good starting point for understanding the nationalist approaches to equality, including those of the modern Labour party. They view a nation as a kind of club all working for mutual benefit. In this sense reducing inequality makes sense. It helps peole to feel like part of the club. It encourages national unity, and a united nation is a strong and peaceful nation.

From the Hobbesian point of view, transferring money to a poor nation like Zimbabwe makes little sense. We may do so out of charity, but they aren't part of our club. So we've got no real obligation to aim for any sort of equality between nations.

Later, in the 19th century, another philosopher, Karl Marx, proposed an alternative model, which saw working people as having far more in common with eachother, across borders, than with the members of the ruling class. So we should forget about the national contract of Hobbes, and replace it with obligations to our fellow workers, regardless of their location. Internationalism has always been a strong strand of thought within socialism, and I suspect that is where the OP is coming from.

However the wealthy have never liked sharing, so other philosophies sprang up in opposition, ranging from fascism and nationalism, which aimed to concentrate power and wealth in a nation, to libertarianism, which aimed to concentrate it in individuals.

In the light of the challenges we now face, all of these right wing philosophies no longer make the slightest sense. If all pursue the advantage of themselves as individuals, or of their nations, then we are surely doomed to experience catastrophic climate change. We will all suffer. But this knowledge doesn't suddenly change human nature. It won't suddenly make rich people give away their wealth and power, and it won't stop ordinary people from wanting x-boxes, new cars, and holidays on the Costa Blanca.

Achieving any realistic solution to challenges like global warming, something that all nations, whether rich or poor, whether oil producers, or consumers, can sign up to, will be tremendously hard. Ultimately it will take a complete re-imagining of the international system at a level even more profound than at Bretton Woods, which itself only became possible after a World War. 

I can't see completely equality as being realistic. There will always be incentives for selfishness, and the selfish will inevitably gather more power than the selfless. But we need to place strong limits on it. We need even the successful to not become so overbearing that they put our very planet at risk. I wouldn't claim to be smart enough to imagine what such a system might look like.

What we must do will be tremendously hard. Many underestimate it. But we still must do what we can for the sake of generations to come.",null,0,null,1438089723,null,0,false,0,ctixmph,null,t3_3evinu,null,t1_ctixmph,null,t3_3evinu,null,null,null,1440133416,null,1,false,UKGreens,t5_34166,1,null

They know that in an unstable ideological climate in which the dominant parties have an increasingly shaky relationship with their traditional base, unexpected things can happen.  It is precisely the opposite of what Blair claimed: there is no guarantee of any ""traditional result"".  They have no idea what the result would be if Corbyn actually won; because they had no idea that Corbyn even stood a chance.  And, remarkably, he does stand a chance.  The Yougov poll putting him some twenty percentage points ahead of his nearest rival, Andy Burnham, and giving him a six points lead with second preferences, may be wrong, but it can't be that wrong.

You seem to be working on the assumption that class is about wealth. That is a major misunderstanding. A good rule of thumb is that class in England = race in the US. Class is about what alcohol you drink, what newspaper you read, what radio or TV programmes you like, whether you even have a TV, etc., etc. You said you've got *Watching the English*; maybe look at that chapter again.

If a white American started dating an African-American, she'd know immediately and would realize she'd have some adjustments to make. Brits can read other people's class status very quickly and make appropriate adjustments automatically. You don't make clear here:

whether they are American, English, or something else. If they are English, it is a little odd, because English people usually avoid talking about class explicitly.

Background: At the time of the incident, Child M had been missing from home for nine weeks. Child M attended college a week after he was first reported missing. Police and children’s social care were informed and told that Child M did not want to return home as he was scared he would be beaten by his stepfather; neither agency visited the college nor investigated this disclosure and Child M was allowed to leave college without confirmed arrangements for his care.

&gt;Anyone can use reasonable force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. You are not expected to make fine judgements over the level of force you use in the heat of the moment. So long as you only do what you honestly and instinctively believe is necessary in the heat of the moment, that would be the strongest evidence of you acting lawfully and in self-defence. This is still the case if you use something to hand as a weapon. As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and the fear felt, the more force you can lawfully use in self-defence.

And

&gt; The force you use must always be reasonable in the circumstances as you believe them to be. Where you are defending yourself or others from intruders in your home, it might still be reasonable in the circumstances for you to use a degree of force that is subsequently considered to be disproportionate, perhaps if you are acting in extreme circumstances in the heat of the moment and don’t have a chance to think about exactly how much force would be necessary to repel the intruder: it might seem reasonable to you at the time but, with hindsight, your actions may seem disproportionate. The law will give you the benefit of the doubt in these circumstances.
This only applies if you were acting in self-defence or to protect others in your home and the force you used was disproportionate – disproportionate force to protect property is still unlawful.

And

&gt; If your action was ‘over the top’ or a calculated action of revenge or retribution, for example, this might amount to grossly disproportionate force for which the law does not protect you. If, for example, you had knocked an intruder unconscious and then went on to kick and punch them repeatedly, such an action would be more likely to be considered grossly disproportionate.

And

&gt; This situation is different as you are no longer acting in self-defence and so the same degree of force may not be reasonable. However, you are still allowed to use reasonable force to recover your property and make a citizen's arrest. You should consider your own safety and, for example, whether the police have been called. A rugby tackle or a single blow would probably be reasonable. Acting out of malice and revenge with the intent of inflicting punishment through injury or death would not.

It does not, however the .gov website [says](https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-force-against-intruders)

&gt; There’s no specific definition of ‘reasonable force’ - it depends on the circumstances. If you only did what you honestly thought was necessary at the time, this would provide strong evidence that you acted within the law.

null,false,the_weeknd,null,null,null,"I have **Hendo**, he offers top value at 7.0 and I think he'll build on the pts he brought in last season, he might get around 175-185pts and at his price thats a bargain. **Milner** could also be a great pick, he'll play a similar role to Hendo in midfield being very much everywhere on the pitch and probably chipping in the odd goal / assist.

I haven't gone for **Coutinho** because I've done it in the past and he always seems to be the player that sets up the attack rather than the goal. He obviously scored a few worldies last season and is definitely capable of doing a lot more this season but right now I've just gone with Hendo purely for value purposes.

**Firmino** is a bit of an unknown quantity, I think he'll be good no matter what, its more of a question of settling, where he'll be deployed and how quickly he'll find form this season, I'll be watching him like a hawk.

**Benteke** is my other and final choice, at 8.5 he was great value for a Villa striker who is capable of scoring 15-18 goals per season if fully fit, now with us I think he could achieve 20~ goals this season and at 8.5 that makes him a Harry Kane like pick similar to last season imo.

**Clyne** is a nono for me, our defence isn't the best and with our fixtures at the start of the season I don't see the point in having him, if we had a good starting 6-9 fixtures without playing so many of the top 6 teams AWAY, I'd probably have him, unfortunately we don't.

**Lallana** could be a big surprise this season, he has a lot to prove this season and he's already talking about that now in the press, at 7.5 he offers great value if he is deployed on the left or right of a 4-3-3 because he will get goals and he will get assists as a more forward attacking winger who has played a lot of games this preseason and also contributed well, keep your eye on him.

If **Mignolet** carries his 2015 form into the season he'll have a fantastic year, again fixtures make him a less attractive choice at 5.0 when other keepers who have easier fixtures and are more rotatable offer better value, definitely worth considering after our fixtures improve because Simon is an excellent shot stopper on his day and you will get more BPS this season for saves.

Its unlikely but if **Gomez** gets a lot of games this season however, at 4.5, if he does indeed get a run of games due to injury or just poor performances, he's worth bringing in for one of your 4.5 defenders (Morgan, O'Shea, Bassong etc.)",null,0,null,1438090672,null,0,false,0,ctiy4mb,null,t3_3ew1gs,null,t1_ctiy4mb,null,t3_3ew1gs,null,null,null,1440133650,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

They'd just spend the whole campaign calling it illegitimate, perhaps call for a boycott, and could be quite confident that the whole thing would fizzle out without major incident in the aftermath. Maybe the SNP would get more support as a result (maybe not), but that's irrelevant to the Tories.


It would be a referendum debated in Scotland. It would be very hard for any of the Scottish parties to boycott such a referendum because a non-binding referendum would only happen if there was significant demand for it in Scotland and it passed through the Scottish Parliament. That would spell political annihilation for all but the SNP as it would be akin to saying *no matter what* they value the decisions of David Cameron over the overwhelming democratic voice of the Scottish People.


I mean technically everyone but the SNP could boycott it and then the SNP would be on shaky ground as to how to proceed, but I think it must be clear to everyone that in that situation independence at some point in the near future would be absolutely inevitable, the UK Government and other Scottish parties would only be painfully delaying the inevitable, that significant support for independence certainly wouldn't fizzle out because David Cameron said you're not allowed to vote on it and attempted to scuttle a democratic vote, quite the opposite I'd imagine.


But again it's quite a fanciful chain of events, because if there really was a Brexit (very unlikely) then I really highly, highly, highly doubt that the PM would attempt to stand in the way of Scottish public opinion at that point.



&gt;And the SNP aren't going to unilaterally declare independence in a situation where no other country in the world recognises them. They're not that radical.

Well, as Nick Cohen in the first article says -

&gt;The first are beyond saving: the political equivalent of Jehovah’s Witnesses. They dismiss all who bring uncomfortable news from the outside world as contaminated sources, who cannot be trusted. In their demonology, Labour politicians become “Tories” or “Blairites” if they contradict Corbyn. Journalists become “tabloid reporters” pursuing “McCarthyite” vendettas if they hold him to account. Their curses are the modern equivalents of “the devil and all his works”, designed to blacken the reputation of all who speak heresy the instant they open their mouths.

I started taking 500mg oxytetracycline twice a day, along with rigevidon (combined pill). For the first time in my adult life, I have went MONTHS without spots. I attempted to go a couple weeks without the antibiotics just to see, and within 7 days I had small spots coming back.

&gt;Oh for f**k's sake, Roberto. Titles? You're not making it easy.

Is this writer an idiot? That is often, especially for people speaking English as a second language, a synonym for trophies, not the league, you can't complain at an ambition to win some cups for fucks sake. If he'd said our aim was to finish in the top half and have the occasional half decent cup run everyone would be fuming. Saying we aim for some cups and top 4 is what he has to say. This guy can't fucking win with some people.
&gt;His decision to blow the whole transfer budget on one young striker 

He's building for the future, only a moron couldn't see that, look at the squad he's assembled, the amount of U23 future stars, he's in it for the long haul and I'd much prefer to slowly build a great team than spunk our money on 5 or 6 mid range signings, disrupt the squad, maybe at best win the League Cup and then suffer for focussing too much on the immediate future.

&gt;See too Martinez's purchase of Lukaku. Plenty of Premier League clubs have learned to embrace (or at least accept) the culture in which they have no choice to be selling clubs. 'Buy low, sell high' has become the motto for Southampton, Swansea and Stoke.

So people complain about us selling our best assets and only buying cheap players for years on end, so we don't sell our best assets for a couple of years and buy an amazing 21 year old whose value will only go up, and people complain still that we're ""pretending not to be a selling club""? 

&gt;The assumption (despite Martinez's front) is that Chelsea will get their man for a fee of around £30m. 

No it fucking isn't. The club has said we're not selling at any price, the player has said he wants to stay, the manager has said he's staying, where the fuck does the assumption that we'd sell for £30m come from? 

This article is a giant pile of heaving shite and I disagree with almost everything in it.

&gt;They don't show how many people were actually convicted of those crimes.

Well, as conviction leads to being imprisoned, surely unless sentence length was different based on race the imprisoned population gives a level of information about convictions?

&gt;You can also see how many Asian men have been getting away with offences against children. Your figures show that 88 men were in prison for sexual offences against children. More than that have been convicted of those sorts of crimes in the last year alone.

I'm not sure that is accurate, you need to substantiate your numbers. The last breakdown of offence type and ethnicity i could find was 2012 data.

No that's the key, that's wrong. The Scottish Government can hold a referendum on whatever it want's any time, it just needs Westminster approval to make it *binding* as in a Yes vote legally must lead to independence negotiations.


So since a non-binding referendum would only ever occur post-Brexit if there was a big surge in support for independence (and DC for some reason refused a binding one, which by the way would only increase support for independence), then we'd be in the situation where Westminster would then have do deal with an undeniable majority Yes vote. I mean sure it's not legally binding so they could just ignore it, but do you really think that would be where it ended?


If Scotland voted to leave the Union in a referendum, blessed by Westminster or otherwise, it's not rocket science to work out that realistically whether Westminster digs their heels or not, independence would follow. And I really doubt Westminster would dig their heels, all it would do is firm up support for independence even further and create a terrible atmosphere for the coming negotiations.


I mean what you're saying is that say 60+% of the Scottish Population vote for independence and David Cameron tells them no, and that's it done and dusted the issue goes away the SNP are defeated, the Scottish people sigh a say ""fair enough"" and the Union continues business as usual, that is some pie in the sky political theory.",null,0,null,1438092173,null,0,false,0,ctiyygz,null,t3_3etrpd,null,t1_ctiyygz,null,t1_ctiyqfw,null,null,null,1440134041,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

At least Sterling will help out defensively, been good in that area this pre-season and he helped out greatly at Liverpool too. If Pellegrini actually start with 4-3-3, then hopefully we'll get more shielding in the middle. I'm silently hoping that Delph will be exactly what we're needed, an energetic midfielder who hopefully link up well with the rest of the team. 

We'll make some changes to the defense though, add some world class players on the sides.

I would have thought it clear by my previous language that I realise they can hold a non-binding referendum, but the point is that it is non-binding and so has no legal basis. They can feasably do anything, but generally when talking about what they can do the implication is we are talking about what they can officially and legally do. Not to mention I doubt the public are going to be happy with the SNP wasting so much resources. 

&gt;So since a non-binding referendum would only ever occur post-Brexit if there was a big surge in support for independence

I believe that the ""In"" vote in Scotland is polling around 53%, I don't think leaving the E.U would be an independence game changer. I have infact found some of my pro independence friends becoming anti-EU as the Greek story has evolved.

&gt;which by the way would only increase support for independence

Why would people who don't support independence be swayed to support independence by the prospect of not having an independence referendum when we just had an independence referendum?

&gt;If Scotland voted to leave the Union in a referendum, blessed by Westminster or otherwise, it's not rocket science to work out that realistically whether Westminster digs their heels or not, independence would follow.

Should we have anybody sleeping on the streets? Should we have 36 thousand properties in London registered in tax havens? Should 1million people be driven to using food banks? (fucking food banks, those things we used to collect cans for at schools and send to poorer countries) Should rich oligarchs be able to buy up property and leave it empty, while 1 in 4 children are brought up in an over crowded home? Should the same big 4 accountancy firms be allowed to help draft our tax legislation, then go back to their big multi billionaire clients and tell them how to exploit the loopholes? Should the poorest people in this country have to pay for the bankers crimes? Because what happened in 2009 was essentially the government bore the risk, and the banks gained the profit, and when the whole thing inevitably fell apart, we bailed the banks out, the same banks who saw record breaking bonuses that year. Does that sound right to you? The people who cause the crash and committed fraud got record breaking bonuses, while 6 years later the poorest people are getting bled dry through austerity, life destroying in some cases. Oh and should MP's be allowed to lobby for big business and abuse there position in order to advance their future career? Because that's essentially what is happening now.

No we are not seeing a better standard of life, and I am 100% sure their is a much better standard of life out there for everybody, and its more than achievable with the right man in charge.

Both are centred on the truth now held as self-evident, that a Corbyn-led Labour has no chance of victory in 2020. The people writing these articles remember the '80s too bitterly to realise that we'll be 40 years down the line, and the electorate has changed. I have no idea whether he'll win or not, but I reckon it would be a far more interesting, and perhaps engaging, election than we've seen recently. Bearing in mind that many of us don't exactly see any of the other candidates as particularly electable to begin with...

Cohen's whole article is written with the semi-unstated opinion that ""sensible tactics"" are to elect a leader who is far more centrist, or centre-right. Note that he doesn't suggest who to support - though I inferred he's on the side of Kendall - but rather sets his views up as ""sensible"" and anything further left of him as left-wing loons.

I mean, look at that final paragraph:

&gt;If they cannot say plainly why his plans are wrong and beliefs immoral, if they cannot challenge him and invigorate the decent people among his supporters by showing them a better way, they will deserve to lose.

*He* hasn't said why Corbyn's plans are wrong or his beliefs immoral. Frankly, I think it's incredibly intellectually dishonest to throw around phrases like that with nothing to back them up, and help spin a narrative based around nothing. Is it Corbyn's belief in renationalising certain natural monopolies that is immoral? His agreement with some, if not all, of Marx's theories?

Hell, it gets worse. Who are ""the decent people among his supporters""? The ones who might decide not to vote for him? The implication being that if any member of the Labour party is not swayed to vote for anything else then they are not decent? I mean, Christ, this is just rude.

He talks about Corbyn ""losing his temper"", throwing him in the same light as a petulant child, during that C4 interview, when anyone watching that interview would be getting frustrated at Guru-Murthy's ridiculous interview technique. Hell, we've seen an increasing amount of bad interviews conducted by Guru-Murthy over Reddit for a while now, why is it bad at all that someone finally called him out on it? He also, by the way, ignores the *actual answer* that Corbyn gave to that question to further spin it into his own narrative of the loony leftist.

He quotes Max Shanly, who is ""a member of Young Labour's National Committee"", not anyone of any major influence to the party, shoving this guy's big words into Corbyn's mouth, as though Corbyn was holding secret meetings of radical leftists, planning to take the centrist majority out behind the bike sheds and shoot them.

It's a borderline-irresponsible article, and frankly when compared to OP's, which focuses on Corbyn's policies and addresses them in a genuinely rational way, completely falls short.

The second article is better written - even as it maintains the same narrative, it at least attempts to back it up. But it's still coming from the same place. The same rhetoric that demonises anyone further left than Andy bloody Burnham, and suggests that the Labour leadership should (as /u/shlerm has said) ignore the leftwards shift of its party's base.

Actually, /u/shlerm's comment is a good TL;DR here:

&gt;Because the only critical journalism you've found are opinion polls bashing left thinking.

&gt;It is a strange criticism saying that a party who are growing more support for left ideas shouldn't have a left leader for elections.

&gt;Both articles were frank that labour supporters have shifted left, but criticise the possibility that the leader should align to that.

I certainly agree with you that the state does get a say and that it has the ability. I suppose I should have said that I don't think it *should* be the State's job to police unreasonableness, capriciousness or harshness. It collects inheritance tax in order to ensure that some of the money of a dead person is used ""properly"" and the understanding is the rest can be left to wherever one likes.

In this case, it doesn't seem as though there was any confusion over her intentions, and if we consider the advice that the charities had been getting, as well as the word ""surprised"", the fact it made a BBC article and the way the BBC added that bit on what experts say this ruling means (which I read as ""since this ruling, this is something you'll all have to do""), the implication is that this wasn't what people expected.

In other words, if I had asked 100 lawyers yesterday, the evidence seems to suggest that not all of them would have said ""Oh yeah, you have to explain way in a way that will be satisfactory to a court"".

And it seems to me to be a fundamental principle that a person should be able to find out if something is illegal or not before doing it and waiting for a judge to rule on it. Even if afterwards a court rules ""Actually, you know what? That probably should have been illegal. Okay, no more of that from now on.""

Ignorance of the law isn't an excuse for breaking it, no. But not being able to predict in advance which way a judge is going to rule based on her interpretation of the law shouldn't be a reason to have your wishes disregarded when the intention is perfectly clear.

And that's the kicker for me; the clear*intention*. Even the daughter doesn't seem to say that there was any intention to leave any of it to her. This isn't some large corporation hiding behind a loophole either, using the law in a way in which it wasn't intended.

And yet only 53% still plan on voting ""In"" unless suddenly the other 47% are going to be struck by lightning and decide that E.U membership is a major issue and the only way to reclaim it is voting for the SNP and a non-binding referendum?

&gt;Because people in Scotland respect their own democratic right. If we see a significant yes vote in a non-binding referendum do you really think the Scottish electorate will be happy with David Cameron throwing it back in their face?

The 55% that voted no are going to feel like we have already had a referendum, why would they support and even switch to the SNP's side when the SNP are just pushing a referendum for their own ends? Just think about it. Imagine someone who voted No in September and still does not support independence, are they going to look at the SNP pushing their agenda with an unofficial referendum and think to themselves ""Gee, that's me a Yes voter now""? You are projecting your viewpoint as a supporter of independence on people who do not support it and who do not want another referendum so soon after the last one. They will not switch to supporting independence because Westminster, rightfully, blocked a referendum.

&gt;'ve already explained why Catalonia is entirely different further up in the thread. Also their vote wasn't exactly convincing due to low turn out meaning the actual result was not 80% in favour. Like I've said again and again a non-binding referendum would only ever happen if the outcome would be a convincing Yes vote.

Why is it entirely different? You are talking about the SNP holding a non-binding referendum. It may very well be plagued by the same low turnout as the only people who are going to get swept along with it are going to be the nationalists.

&gt;Like I've said again and again a non-binding referendum would only ever happen if the outcome would be a convincing Yes vote.

So what is the point in this conversation? It's gone from David Cameron rightfully saying another referendum will not happen so soon, to some imaginary situation where independence has massive support *and* Westminster refused to allow a referendum. If support were large enough Westminster would allow a referendum, but it will never reach the levels you are talking about, certainly not over something like the E.U.",null,0,null,1438094058,null,0,false,0,ctj03jj,null,t3_3etrpd,null,t1_ctj03jj,null,t1_ctizrh1,null,null,null,1440134579,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

**Username:** /u/SittingAnteater        
**Original Post:**          
I recently upgraded to an MSI R9 390 and providing it remains stable over the next few weeks I'll be looking to move on my old [MSI GTX 670 Power Edition](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-n670pe2gd5oc). How much is one of these worth? I've had it for 2 years, used for gaming and only has the factory overclock. There's only one listing for the same card on ebay right now and it's for £100. To be honest, that seems a little high to me for a card that's pretty dated by now. Anybody know what it's worth?

There's a lot of other offences included, i think you're rather leaping to assume the best of a cohort which is going to include quite a lot of child abusers, just to put that out there. 

&gt;It would take time, but there have been several incidents of child grooming gangs made up of 10 or 20+ members being convicted in the last year. And that is just from the high profile cases that have made it into the media.

I think there's likely to be a rise over the next few years due to this, but nonetheless, it's clear that statistics indicate just as big a problem among whites. To throw yet more stats out there - [convictions of sexual activity with a minor in 2011](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales) seems to present a similar picture to the convict population (table 4.10) with a higher proportion white convictions being for sexual activity with a minor.

Secondly it does have the potential to take up your entire free time (as any hobby can, I suppose). Since joining the OU, I've become a bit of a recluse.

I agree that the right thing for Osborne to do was to slow down austerity because of how low interest rates were and how high a proportion of GDP government spending was - even if he did grandstand as if he was sticking to the plan. We should be happy he seems to be balancing it right. I would also agree that it is a good time to borrow for infrastructure projects and fiscal stimulus to try and include growth in how we address the deficit. I'm not at all against capital borrowing and I disagree with the government on that. The only difference is that I think we needed to move from a position where public spending was at a rate based on an assumption which has been disproved: that Gordon Brown's approach had ended boom and bust. The fact that a recession would push government spending to 53% is indicative that it was regularly too high in an environment where recession was possible. We were in a position where we had to borrow 10% of GDP come what may or face massive unplanned cuts. That's an unacceptable gamble.  

The key for the Tories was to strike the right balance so that austerity didn't cause a substantial double dip while taking advantage of the public's acceptance that cuts are necessary in day to day services.

I plan to vote for Jeremy. I am angry and upset at the name-calling from the rest of the Labour party / media / world about this choice.

&gt;&gt;I am not a moron, I do not need a heart transplant. I am not under-educated or naïve. 

&gt;&gt;My question for Liz is - why do the rest of the Labour party seem to think it is acceptable to be so audaciously rude about Jeremy Corbyn's supporters? If he does not win, what would you do to ensure that those who supported him feel included and heard?

&gt;&gt;My question for Jeremy is - how do we help the rest of the Labour party realise that thinking people can be left wing and that being called left-wing is not an insult?

&gt;Hello StregaNona - its not acceptable for anyone to be rude about party members who support any of the candidates, full stop! Your views must and will be heard. We all want an open and honest debate in the party about our future.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Will you do the decent thing and stand down now.

&gt;&gt;Thanks. Can I pose a question back to you. What would be decent about removing myself from a process in which many people have put in a huge amount of time and energy to develop a good, decent alternative political strategy for our party?

&gt;I don't agree that Jeremy should stand down. He's putting forward his views - lets have the debate in an open and honest manner and then it will be for Labour party members to decide.

My respect for Liz just shot up, although she probably lost most of her MP supporters by saying that..

&gt; Jeremy: I love your passion. But I can't stomach a return to no tuition fees, it feels very regressive to subsidise people who are already very clever and capable to get even more ahead; they should take more risk of what their education will be good for. 

Well... at least this person is honest about their feelings... ""Fuck people for being smart, they don't deserve education..""

&gt;&gt;Dear Liz Kendall, what is it you like about Public Enemy I listen to them myself and I think their politics are much more in line with Jeremy Corbyn than yours, we have heard from Jeremy but how will you fight the powers that be, or are you there to support the power?

&gt;where to start...?! I love their rhythm (great to run to) but more importantly their powerful sense of injustice, their refusal to accept the status quo, and their anger about some people holding all the power in life while too many have none. Life doesn't have to be the way it is. We can change it. That's why I'm in politics.

That's oddly quite a good insight into her.

You have Vieira saying he's the best player he's seen at EDS. But you have a lot of people who's watched him over the season saying he's nowhere good enough defensively. The few matches I've seen on TV has confirmed that view, but he doesn't get much help from Barker on the other hand. Also some complaints about his strength, but that'll come with age. 

Then you have us shipping him out to the MLS. If they don't get to playoffs his season ends in October. Then resting, as he hasn't had rest for 1½ year by then. Then I guess a loan to a La Liga club, hopefully. Even if he isn't the best defensively, fact is that many teams need a left back. Possibly going to the Championship?

He's already by far good enough offensively, question is how good he can get on defense. Patrick tried him as left winger a couple of times, he'll probably change to that if he's unable to get better defensively. My bet is playing for us earliest 16/17 season, maybe later.

Attempting to suggest that due to one offence included being more 'minor', the statistics indicating overrepresentation of whites in offences against minors isn't something to worry about.

&gt;What I am saying is that when talking about sexual abuse, most people would put viewing child pornography in a different category. The statistics in your report don't differentiate.

No they don't, but given the lack of a breakdown, and the approximate accordance with the 2011 data which doesn't include the possession of child pornography, it seems likely that a large portion of the offences against children aren't the most minor offense in the dataset.

&gt;Its important to note that sexual activity with a minor does not include the more serious crimes of rape and sexual assault, which are grouped with all rapes in your data. Asians are over represented in those numbers.

To break it down by raw numbers, it could also be noted that whites are the only group who had more instances of sexual activity with a minor rather than rapes. Or that 22% of all offenses by whites are sexual activity with a minor, double the rate of black, Asian or other groups. 

You can spin the numbers round and round to try and implicate as you wish.

First, some background: I do not profess to be a seasoned expert. My employment background has been mostly in finance and management roles.
Through school, I picked up a lot of technical skills. These are excellent and incredibly valuable (from how to think about creating an IT management strategy for maximum wisdom gain to how to properly account for taxes in a firm’s capital mix in order to maximise shareholder value). These are incredibly useful skills that will come up from time to time throughout an executive career.

However, it occurs to me that there is something else that I’ve been learning. There are other things that seem to seep through the cracks of the education; things that almost every class or text points to and yet somehow they are never laid bare. So here we are. What follows are the core lessons that I have taken from business school:

First (and this one’s big): the only way to add value to a firm is by creating value for its customers. I know that this one might seem obvious in a sort of naïve way. But then there are entire classes and schools of thinking (pretty much the entire “finance” career sector) that state that you can create value by optimising your capital structure. This simply is not true. The starting point, the revenue that you are optimizing your capital structure around, it all comes from the customer. Rather than add value, a trained CFO does their best to mitigate its destruction via things like taxes and unchecked risk. These techniques, while tools necessary to maximise value for a firm (by minimising its destruction) do nothing to actually create value. That comes from the customers. So how do we do that?

First, it’s important to recognise that there are only three business sectors: product (or manufacturing), resale, and service. They may be blended, a bit, but every company in the world is primarily one or another. (Apple, Asda, and Google).
To coincide with the three types of business there are three ways to create value for customers. That’s it. Just three. Before I jump into what they are it is important to explain what value is to a customer. To put it simply: it's a benefit received from your offering that has more utility to the customer than what they are giving you in exchange (money, although it doesn’t have to be).
Now onto the three methods:

&gt;Sophistication: Having an expertise in a craft that is not easily replicated maximises value. Apple is able to make more profit on a smartphone than a hammer manufacturer is able to make on a hammer for the simple reason that the smartphone is much more sophisticated, and thus harder for others to reproduce. The “others” here means not only competitors, but also the consumer. Sophistication should be the primary tool of value creation in the product (manufacturing) category of business model.

&gt;Economies of scale: Just about everybody recognises that the larger your up front investment, the lower your per unit costs. The larger you grow, the more value you are able to create for your customers. Asda is able to create a hypereffecient value chain due almost entirely to their enormity and economy of scale. Even in growing to their current size, the company reinvested earnings into growth aimed at obtaining economies of scale.

&gt;Simplification: For a long time it was hard for service companies to grow past a certain size. Restaurants and hotels could only grow so large in a given market before being faced with steep competition that seemed to offer the same value to customers as they were. Eventually value was added to the process by franchises and corporations who offered to simplify the delivery of their services (through streamlined menus and concierge services, for example, both benefitting from economies of scale). These services simplified the experience for their customers, though, which is what ultimately enhanced the customer value. Today, service companies on the internet are able to capitalise on simplification ever more, with companies cashing in by creating services that offer to simplify processes that were once complicated and cumbersome. This is ultimately the business model of every great tech company (Google, Amazon, Airbnb, Squarespace, Mailchimp, etc, etc, etc).

Just as the three core business models (product, resale, service) can be blended, so too--obviously, are the three core methods of value creation. The best companies are masters of all three, and therefore create the maximum value for their customers. Ultimately, however, each strong firm will specialise in the value creation method that corresponds with its business model.

The principle reasons given for not voting are that there is no difference between the parties, and that their vote doesn't count. That is never going to change if the main parties are all fighting over the same ground, and is why so many traditional labour voters stayed at home or went to UKIP.

Turnout in Scotland was a huge increase over the last election, in no small part down to the existence of a vibrant, distinct, anti-austerity alternative.  

Labour cannot win by ONLY appealing to the centre. The more it follows that path, the more it bleeds its core support to fringe parties and the lower the turnout, which favours the electorate on the right who always come out to vote. It needs to rebuild a base which is energised and motivated and dedicated to Labour, and that simply does not exist in the centre.

Even if by some miracle it did win by making itself indistinguishable from the Tories, what on earth is the point in that?

null,false,ladadadas,null,null,null,"Especially because Michel Foucault is just as important: 

""A citizenry that’s constantly on guard for secret, unaccountable surveillance is one that’s constantly being remade along the lines the state would prefer. Foucault illustrated this point by reference to a hypothetical prison called the Panopticon. Designed by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, the Panopticon is a prison where all cells can be seen from a central tower shielded such that the guards can see out but the prisoners can’t see in. The prisoners in the Panopticon could thus never know whether they were being surveilled, meaning that they have to, if they want to avoid running the risk of severe punishment, assume that they were being watched at all times. Thus, the Panopticon functioned as an effective tool of social control even when it wasn’t being staffed by a single guard.""

""In his famous Discipline and Punish, Foucault argues that we live in a world where the state exercises power in the same fashion as the Panopticon’s guards. Foucault called it **“disciplinary power;” the basic idea is that the omnipresent fear of being watched by the state or judged according to prevailing social norms caused people to adjust the way they acted and even thought without ever actually punished. People had become “self-regulating” agents, people who “voluntarily” changed who they were to fit social and political expectations without any need for actual coercion.**""

In the long term he fancies himself a central defender, but as with most young central defenders has been mainly used as a fullback so he can get game time.

He managed 12 games in the league for us (19 in all comps) in Rodgers debut season when he was 19, looking solid but inexperienced for someone of his age. 

He was sent on loan to Derby the following season where he performed very well. He was used at right back and had a very solid year with Derby ultimately losing to QPR in that play off final. 
I remember talking to a lot of Derby fans who had been very impressed with him.

So naturally after a successful loan to the championship, next was a loan to a premier league team. 

Initially he was a starter but fell out of favour when Pulis took over. He definitely didn't perform to the same standard he did with Derby, so it remains to be seen how he will do this year. 

His strengths are he's quite athletic, and the defensive side of his game is strong. But as he is a central defender playing as a fullback his weakness is going forward. 

His technical skills aren't the best and he won't provide much danger going forward.


Overall he has a lot of promise still, and has been playing premier league/high level championship football for 4 seasons now at the age of 22 so he's pretty experienced. I think and hope he'll do a job for you.

I'm working towards a History degree, but an issue for me was that in the first year the study the actual history content was minimal. It started with a broad study of the arts, which meant instead of focusing on anything history related I was interpreting paintings and poetry (which I was happy to leave behind in GCSE Literature).

As for the module I've just finished, I was left incredibly sour because the way OU weights assessments. I had got a Grade 2 for six assessments and Grade 3 in one. My final Grade for the year was 3, which I didn't feel accurately reflected my abilities. It was a major disappointment for what was otherwise an engaging and interesting module.

I hear that tutors are also a bit of a hit and miss issue, but so far all the tutors I've been assigned were great. Couldn't have asked for better ones. 

It doesn't take up a lot of time, but it's something that takes several years to complete. Whether I would recommend it I guess depends on how organised you are, if you have the will power to complete it, and most of all whether you will receive financial support. I'm able to pay fees upfront but I choose not to, instead opting for loans which I will likely never repay. 

The price tag for an education with the OU is absurd, ridiculous, and possibly extortionate. It's cheaper than going to a traditional University in the UK but that doesn't mean a whole lot when the UK has the highest tuition fees in Europe.

null,false,Richie__Dagger,null,null,null,"This is probably one of the most devastating losses (in my opinion) for a while. Dave and Ivanovic are not what I would consider the ""complete"" modern fullback, while Luis was. Whenever Luis played he provided the perfect amount of attack and defense throughout the whole game. For me that's what set teams like Bayern, Barca and Real apart from the rest, it's the constant pressure by the whole team which includes fullbacks. This season Ivanovic has been to focused on attacking leaving us very vulnerable down the right side, which weakens our overall squad significantly. Even when Ivanovic was in position he played to narrow, this is evident when you see that most of the goals we conceded came from his side. On the other hand Dave is unable to push forward and a get decent ball into our attackers because his left foot isn't so good. Luis is everything we need in a fullback to be able to compete with the big boys. He's great at attacking and he's also good at applying a great amount of defensive pressure. Chelsea needs to become a team that is relentless and with out current fullback situation I don't see that being possible.

This lack of balance from our fullbacks was clear when we played Atletico in the champions league 2 years ago. Juanfran and Luis were having a field day destroying our wings. They spent the whole game getting in behind and whipping the ball in. 

I am optimistic though, I'm positive Mou has a plan. As of late he's been looking for long term solutions to our first team, and I think his solution will be Baba. Baba is VERY good going forward, is able to get perfect crosses in, and unlike Luis he's is actually able to dribble around the opposition. Baba, Zouma, Stones, Dave and Courtois could eventually become the most feared defense in the world. All are quick, able to push forward when needed, can distribute the ball and are excellent defenders, hell even Courtois helps with counter attacks.

So they tried to force me to pay the remainder on my contract on just the phone, which went back and forth a bit.

 According to this, child pornography is almost exclusively consumed by  [white men.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14654867)	There are around [1700](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/john-carr/record-level-of-convictio_b_1363732.html)	 convictions or cautions each year for these types of offences, so clearly they make up a very large number of the 2983 offences against children from your data. 

&gt;To break it down by raw numbers, it could also be noted that whites are the only group who had more instances of sexual activity with a minor rather than rapes. Or that 22% of all offenses by whites are sexual activity with a minor, double the rate of black, Asian or other groups.

I  agree with that. White people are over represented in the less serious crime of sexual activity with a child, and under represented in the more serious crimes of rape and sexual assault. For black and Asians, it is the other way around. Which suggests that while every group has the same potential for serious child abuse, it is more prevalent among black and Asians.

I do admit that towards the end of the season we did look dire but at the same time, that wasn't Sherwood's teams. This season he has built the team that he has wanted, he has been given some funds (quite a bit actually) and I hope that Villa finish a lot higher than the few previous seasons. I don't think we can challenge for European competition spots with foreign players who have yet to adapt to the Premier League, but many players have been given long-term contracts so there is a long-term project with Sherwood.

For a while in the middle of the season Ivanovic was getting caught too far forward and it left Cahill more exposed. But when Ivanovic does track back, we are impossible to beat off of counter-attacks because Dave usually never goes too far forward and has pace to get back, Matic roams the middle of the pitch because he never goes too far forward, and Fabregas, Oscar, and Willian are all good at winning the ball back after losing it/closing out the passing lanes that prevent counters. 

Above all else, Ivanovic just gives just so much flexibility, and I think that is his most appealing trait to Jose, obviously besides his leadership, which is also very good. This is my personal opinion, but I think Jose has realized that he's got something very good here in his fullback combination. A defensively oriented pacy left-back compliments Hazard, an attacking player who is best when he's given a free role, to roam anywhere. And an attack-minded big right-back who has a wide range of pass compliments Willian, who is a defense-first pacy winger/attacking midfielder. 

If we keep Willian in the starting 11 in 2-3 years time, then I'll be interested to see if Jose does do what I think and buy that hybrid RB/CB. But in 2-3 years time is when I would expect RLC to be knocking on the door for a spot in the starting 11.

If I don't want to get too pissed: [Wu Gang Chops the Tree](http://pressuredropbrewing.co.uk/portfolio-item/wu-gang-chops-the-tree/). It's a wheat beer that only has 3.8% alcohol, but it tastes like it's much stronger.

If I want to pretend to be Belgian: [Orval](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/37/129/) or [Grimbergen Blonde](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/grimbergen-blonde/3948/). Orval seems more widely available in the UK these days. Both are delicious and pretty strong, although not ruinously so.

If it's a hot day and I want something refreshing: [Camden Town](http://www.camdentownbrewery.com/the-beers/) Hells Lager or Pale Ale. (I usually prefer the Pale Ale but I guess sometimes I'm just in a lager mood.) 

If I want to stick to traditional hand pumps then [Deuchars IPA](http://www.caledonianbeer.com/beers/deuchars-ipa) (mainly because it's reliably available in my local) or pretty much anything from the [Hop Back Brewery](http://www.hopback.co.uk/).

If I want something super-local then one of the beers from my [closest microbrewery](http://www.thebohemia.co.uk/). Not much good unless you're in north London though.

If I just want a few cheap tinnies for at home then something Polish from the corner shop.

null,false,Flying_Ferret,null,null,null,"&gt;I agree that the right thing for Osborne to do was to slow down austerity because of how low interest rates were and **how high a proportion of GDP government spending was**

I don't think this is necessarily that bad, a lot of the research into the size of the public sector and economic growth has shown there is not much correlation between the two (disregarding some areas like education which showed positive correlation). I don't mind them cutting the structural deficit on ideological grounds too much so long as they had increased capital spending and ring-fenced education so growth didn't stagnate. Although the current level of growth is back to the trend pre-crisis level, typically after a recession you would have higher than trend growth due to the spare capacity and we haven't seen that. 

&gt;The key for the Tories was to strike the right balance so that austerity didn't cause a substantial double dip while taking advantage of the public's acceptance that cuts are necessary in day to day services. Only by doing this can we ensure that we don't end up in the same situation all over again if there is another bust in the near future.

I feel we should have waited till we were in a position to cut the deficit without harming growth i.e when interest rates were back up and monetary policy could offset the impact of austerity on demand. For me high growth was more important than getting the debt down, high deficits always follow recession and as GDP increased the size of the deficit would have gone down automatically. To ensure we don't end up in the same situation I feel it's far more important to fix the problems that caused us to have such a severe reaction to the global financial crisis last time: Overspecialisation in the financial sector and poor regulation of the banks. Bank regulation has improved drastically since the recession but we still need to do more work to diversify our economy so we are not so vulnerable as we were last time.

When you cut the police budget by 18-20%, when you lose 21,000 staff across the country and then tell them there will be **another** 18% cut to their budget over the next five years how the hell do you expect them to deliver the same service? 

Anyone involved in healthcare or policing (and yes, the two are linked) are already aware that they're not providing the same cover-service that they used to, filling the cracks between social care and emergency response. Crime numbers haven't reduced, they're just not being reported any more because there's no point. 

Burglaries are hard to solve, stuff is sold quickly then moved on to people who don't care that it's stolen goods. At that point it's all-but-untraceable. At best you can dust for prints and hope for a hit, but CSI is fiction and the forensic teams who carry out that work have had their budgets hammered too. 

The Police Federation missed the mark when they were protesting in 2010, made it all about that pleb nonsense. Their every statement needed to be ""what is it we do now that you want us to stop doing?"" 

""Too many non-jobs... blah blah blah."" So sure, let's cut the civilian staff on 17k from the front desk and put a warranted police officer on 22k on there instead. Fewer ""non-jobs"". HR still needs doing, as does payroll, as does everything else you'd expect in a massive organisation, The fewer civilians involved the more expensive it gets. Knee-jerk populist shite. 

""Single officer patrols providing a ""presence"" on the streets"" Here's the thing, there are places where that's a good way to get a dead police officer. So now there are areas that could really do with some community policing that get very little, because to do it at all you need the manpower to cover when shit goes sideways.

We are one of seven teams to have remained in the premier league since the beginning (the others are United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Everton) and are founders of the original English league (The villa director in 1888 is the one who started it all). 

We have also been massively successful over the years, winning the European cup, the first division (7 times!), the FA cup (5 times), and being runners up in the premier league &amp; first division multiple times.

Recently, we have made it to the FA cup final (2015, 2000), the league cup final (2010) and have finished top 6 on four occasions (2010, 2009, 2008, 2004). 

Villa Park is an incredible stadium seating a bit over 42,000 people, and has remained Villa's stadium since 1882. 

It's a fantastic place to visit if you get the chance. 

Where do you live? Are you going to visit England somewhen (before the internship)?
