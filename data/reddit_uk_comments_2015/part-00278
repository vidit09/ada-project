The worst part is that this has been a constant problem throughout history and is still ongoing. Time and time again, people or groups always try to decide what art is ""lewd"" or not, or tries to censor art based off of some other nonsensical standard.

Art causes emotional reactions, and again, who is anyone to judge another for the emotions that are elicited? Especially if said emotions are nothing but sexual. Sexuality is a positive thing for anyone to explore, and a negative thing to withold from them, with the exception of when said sexuality will harm others.

* We have done good business so far, our leakiness at the back has (hopefully) been addreessed. On top of that we have done well to get rid of a lot of the players who didnt quite fit into the squad.

* We still have a fair amount of business to do in the transfer window most importantly at the striker and CM positions. Up front we need cover for Kane and in the middle of the park Bentaleb needs a partner. Mason is decent but not special and he went off the boil pretty badly towards the end of last season. Furthermore there are still a few players who we should get off the books (ade, Soldado, lennon are the ones that come to mind).

* Realistic suggestions. At striker - Berahino, Benteke and Jay rodriquez are all options. In the middle McCarthy is probably the best option.

**Players**

* Best XI

Lloris 
 Rose - Vertonghen - Alderweild - Walker 

Bentaleb - Mason 

Eriksen - Dembele - Lamela 

Kane 

* I remain that Lamela will come into full bloom next season and i also think that after his injury plagued shocker last year, the added competition will make Walker step it up as well.

* I think the biggest danger is Kane not having another blow out of a season and I am worried about Dier, last year he got a ton of experience and 1st team football last year with the defenders we have bought that may not be the case this year and his progress may stall.

3. Show the sources of your research. If you found a forum post from 10 years ago, is it as relevant as the official admissions page from the university? 

Here's what I'd suggest. 

* Email the university in NZ and ask them what you need to do / provide in order to transfer to them. I did an exchange with a foreign university and I needed to provide transcripts, a letter of recommendation, vaccination certificates etc. 

* Email Roehampton and ask whether they have a formal procedure for transferring. How much of your tuition will you have to pay if you move before the end of the first year etc?

* In both cases keep your questions concise and fact based. Don't engage in speculation (""What if X?""). 

* Check the NZ government website to see what you need to do in order to get a student visa.

Why the fuck is him owning a villa a bad thing? What more could we want than convincing rich people that sharing their wealth is better than hoarding it and they should vote labour? As it is, it's actually his family's not his. 

He also denied firmly that he was a member of that club and didn't have that locker, and I'll believe a labour MP over the daily mail any day. 

The northern thing was a joke that failed. You can't dislike someone for failing to make a joke well. I'm pretty sure all of us have made a cringeworthy joke at some point that we wish we had never said. 

The trash comment is fair game, but again, he's on a network of cool people trying to seem cool. We've all probably made ourselves look like twats when trying to appear cool.

null,false,TheSmellOfSilence,num23,,null,"I'm very happy with our activity in the transfer market. Needless to say, I'm delighted with the purchase of Alderweireld, who will prove to be an immense signing. Not only that, his history and chemistry with Vertonghen could improve both of them, and potentially turn them into the best defensive partnership in the league. I'm also excited about having Trippier in the squad, who looks like a really solid full back. The fact that he's a fantastic crosser makes it even better, seeing as many of our wingers are incapable of performing a simple cross. Wimmer also looks very solid, should be a good signing for the future, and could come useful in some of our less important games. I also really like his mentality, which is something that our squad desperately requires. 

In terms of sales, getting rid of the deadwood is a massive plus. I honestly did not expect us to sell so many players at such a fast rate, and it seems that we're going to sell even more before the transfer window is over. The only dealing which concerns me a bit is the sale of Holtby, who I personally really liked.

I'm still completely convinced that we need a new centre mid who's capable of covering our defence. It doesn't have to be a DM, especially considering that Poch doesn't seem to like them very much. However, I don't want another season where we struggle to get a positive goal difference, and the main way of achieving that is by ensuring that we have someone in midfield who is defensively-competent, alongside Bentaleb. As much as I like Mason, he is simply not top 4 quality. Although, to be completely honest, I have no idea who we could possibly get to replace him. Kramer and Camacho tend to come up from time to time, but I'm not sure if they suit Poch's play-style. Except for that, we also need a back-up for Kane, and possibly an additional winger. Getting an exciting youngster for the future would also be nice, as long as we focus on our priorities first. We also still have to sell Ade, Soldado and Vlad, but I guess everyone already knows that. 

I think our starting XI should consist of Kane, Chadli, Eriksen, Lamela, [New Signing], Bentaleb, Rose, Vert, Toby, Walker and Lloris. Walker should be given one more chance to prove what he's capable of. If he underperforms in the first half of the season then Trippier should replace him(unless he plays poorly as well). Also, even though I put Jan and Toby together, I still want Dier to play relatively often, as he can improve massively in the upcoming years. Despite making a few mistakes last year he was still a vital part of our squad, and it absolutely terrifies me how good he could become in the future. 

This is linked to the next question as to who will improve on their last season. Except for Dier, I fully expect Lamela to finally establish himself as a first team regular. Despite being invisible for a large chunk of the season, he was still a very good player for us last season. A brilliant game against QPR at the start of the season, the rabona against Asteras Tripolis, the Bale-esque goal against Burnley and his performances in the last 3 games of the season, not to mention that fact that no one else in the squad managed to get more assists than him, is nothing to be ashamed of. 
Chadli could also improve significantly. After his first season, he promised to improve, and he did. A few weeks ago, he made another promise to become even better, and I believe he can do it. In addition, I really want Davies to improve. As a Swansea fan I can tell you that he has much more potential than Rose, and so I would be really glad if he was given more time to impress. 

In terms of regress, I don't think anyone is going to permanently decline. Kane is probably not going to be as good as he was last season, due to the fact that some of his brilliant performances were inspired by the desire to break into the first team. Now that he has pretty much secured the striker spot, he doesn't have to worry about it as much. However, I'm convinced he is still going to be a vital part of our squad, and at some point in the future he's going to have at least one season during which he'll perform even better than in his first one.

&gt;**308 to 308**

As you note, the Tories don't have 308 MPs, they have 330. The Conservatives will have only whipped this using a minor whip (e.g. a one line whip) as they knew Labour were abstaining. There's no reason to assume that the 22 Tories who didn't vote were doing so because they objected- it might be because they had other important duties that they didn't feel the need to abandon in this case, but would have if they had needed to. They may also have taken advantage of the pairing system.

The Doctor doesn't have to try to hide who he is anymore but that means he has to figure out who he really is after all of that too. 

All of this is to say, where he starts out at the beginning of the season as a character is noticeably different than where he is at the end so don't panic if you don't have him figured out after the first few episodes like you probably did with Matt. That's kind of the point.

Oh and for what it's worth, I actually think Capaldi brings back a lot of gravitas that Tennant had but Smith struggled with at times. Tennant is still my favorite overall but Capaldi does a really good job of embodying the character in all these little subtle expressions and vocal inflections. It seems like they focus more on what he conveys with his face rather than showing Smith waving his arms around all the time.

1. First of all check out [Monevators list of cheap online brokers](http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/). Given your capital and contributions there may be a cheaper alternative (e.g. Charles Stanley or Cavendish Online) than HL.

1. Secondly, Vanguard offer a range of funds under the name [LifeStrategy](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy/#/). These are already internationally diversified (multiple countries, some emerging markets), risk diversified (stocks &amp; bonds depending on which LifeStrategy fund), automatically rebalancing and low cost.

Hargreaves Lansdown are a reputable online broker but charge slightly more than the alternatives. The Monevator link provided does not take into account customer service, interface usability or research/information provided by the services. If you think they extra cost is worth it then they aren't a bad choice.

Nutmeg is OK if you like the sparkly interface and aren't sure about what you want to invest in. Unfortunately it charges what is, at least in my opinion, a relatively a high fee.

- Pleased with our overall business so far. Defence looking stronger, esp with proper right back cover and some of the deadwood in the squad has left for good money. Carroll and Pritchard add some  extra depth to the squad, and most likely, hungrier backup.

- We've seen so often, huge squad overhaul is damaging. We're rightfully making the squad leaner so it makes no sense to start stuffing a bunch of new players in the squad. I think only a centre midfielder and a striker are absolutely necessary.

- It difficult to suggest individual players really. I do think we're perhaps lacking some experience in the squad so I wouldn't mind a 'Davids' or 'Naybet' type signings. The problem we have is signing a striker who is willing to play second fiddle to Kane as absolutely nothing should prevent Harry from getting playing time.

- We should only be selling the players who contributed very little to the previous season. We've got rid of most of these but I'd definitely include Chiriches, Lennon (sadly) and Ade (not so sadly) to that list. 


Players

- Much the same as the past season. Lloris, Walker, Toby, Vert, Rose, Mason, Bentaleb, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Kane.

- Honestly, looking at the age of our squad, then I'd suggest all of them. We're so quick to be critical of all our players but we finished 5th with the youngest squad in the league. That's a huge achievement and these players deserve a little more faith that we currently give them.

But that squad will need strengthening with older players, like Lallana for example. And those players could get disgruntled for having to play with the kids in the B-tournament.

Hello Hardwareswappers.
I am selling a Saitek x55 Hotas Joystick system, this a system which has been used around 2/3 times. I unfortunately don't have the space to use this equipment effectively, therefore forcing me to sell it. The Joystick and Throttle are basically brand new like i said earlier, they have been used only two or three times. It comes with the box and all accessories.
Price: It was bought on Amazon for £160. Seeing as it is in perfect condition i would be asking for around £110. I can include postage in this price! Obviously that £110 is negotiable. If shipping out of the UK we will talk on postage price.

First of all he isn't defensively frail.  Because I'm not even sure what that means.  He is a robust big man that can tackle and use his body so I assume you meant tactically. 

The reason he got forward was Can and Sakho both were the ball playing CB's that moved the ball out from the back by keeping the ball on the ground.  Teams either pressed the CB's or fell back into coverage.  If they pressed the midfielders came to help alleviate the pressure if the team fell into coverage the CB's had space to move.  And Can would dribble out. 

The Sakho-Skrtel-Can back line was one of the best defensive schemes of last year.  And he rarely made 'impulsive' forward runs.  Usually he would get forward if the above aforementioned team fell into coverage or Liverpool had a great deal of possession but couldn't find an open man or run (something that happened a lot more than it should have).  

Also you are critiquing his aspects of style not defensive capability.  He can tackle, can shield the ball and is very good in the air.  

I don't feel he is too reckless at all.  Recklessness is usually an attribute of someone without maturity or composure something Can has in spades.

I do, however, like that you're trying to incorporate artistic mediums into photography. That was the biggest challenge I undertook at university: reimagining photography and taking it away from its figurative approach. We're saturated with images of things, so much so that we refer to photographs of objects as objects themselves. If somebody shows us a photo of the Taj Mahal and asks us what we're looking at, we say the Taj Mahal when we're actually looking at a photograph of the Taj Mahal.

The two systems most associated with the name, closed- and open-list PR are actually fairly different in terms of operation, and both have a lot of negative qualities. 

Closed-list basically means that there is not control over the order that candidates will be elected.  This is what happens when electing MEPs.  People vote for a party, that party decides which MPs are elected.  This is, in my opinion, a terrible way to run an election, because it means we have no control over who is elected, and MPs can stay in power for as long as they like, without being answerable to the general public.  There are ways around this (votes of no confidence etc) but working out how to make sure it's not too easy or too hard to remove an MP is a hard problem.

Open-list PR allows the electorate to simultaneously vote for individual MPs as well, where different forms of open-list PR assign different weights to the public vote.  The issue here is, with a parliament of a few hundred seats, most people don't know who each candidate is, what they have done, and why they should or shouldn't vote for them.  Voting is done positively, so it's impossible to ""unvote"" bad or notorious candidates, while simultaneously being difficult for new, public-favoured candidates to be elected without a huge groundswell of support.

Neither of these systems seems at all good to me.  The fact that they produce perfectly proportional parliaments seems of little use when the elected MPs aren't held accountable to anyone.",null,0,null,1437469343,null,0,false,0,ctapbuz,null,t3_3dymdx,null,t1_ctapbuz,null,t1_cta5hcv,null,null,null,1438051142,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

All decisions which turn on the delivery of public services (health Education, welfare etc) should be taken, within a framework of national entitlements, at the lower level closer to the citizen.

null,false,YOUGOTTAPIZZABRO,England,CBR500R,null,"That's a fair point, I suppose it really depends on which bike you're going to and from. If I went from a restricted ER6 to an R6, it wouldn't be much different weight wise.

Completely agree on mileage. Its actually not a bad idea to put it solely on mileage in my opinion. Once you ride 10,000, you can get a bigger bike, perhaps with some modified test to prove you are in fact not a hooligan. This wouldn't work for riders say in London, who perhaps commute, but don't really put many miles on.

I personally think that the best way it could go is that you do your tests as they are, and if you're below a certain age, you're restricted, as I am now. But then to unlock my full licence, I have to become a member of the institute of advanced motorists. My dads a part of it, and he says he's improved dramatically during his observed rides etc.

This will solve a few problems:
1. get rid of repeating the exact same test 2 years later
2. gets some younger riders in the institute, which I know is something they're struggling with (they can't shake the 'old man club' look)
3. the tests are actually quite good, it takes a while to ride to their standard (which is better and MUCH more practical than a test standard)
4. you'll become of a larger biking community, which I would be a part of if there were more younger rides. I'm not that interested in going to Wales for a long weekend with a bunch of oldies (no offence folks).

That's the best answer in my opinion. I'd learn to ride at a better standard, it's cheaper, I'd meet lots of new riders, become part of a community, get great advice, the institute would bloom, and you could get a bigger bike in a quicker time, but in my opinion, in a safer manner. Also perhaps before you can get an unrestricted licence you also have to go on a trip with them (where they do like 200 miles a day), that'll get your miles and experience up a lot quicker than just poking around town on your own.",null,0,null,1437469890,null,0,false,0,ctapgm6,null,t3_3dxktn,null,t1_ctapgm6,null,t1_cta1qcp,null,null,null,1438051210,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

Hi all,

Looking to build a hackintosh.
Require:

CPU - i3 or i5 depending on money.
MOBO - Gigabyte mini itx h81 or z97
PSU - 500W or greater

Let me know if you have any of the above for sale and prices you are willing to sell at.

Mobo is more than likely going to have to be a gigabyte unless you can show me a simple hackintosh install with the make you are offering.

Thanks :)

* it's much bigger than Bristol: Leeds is the third-biggest city in the UK by some definitions and has 800,000 people at the smallest count. 

* it has a huge student culture with three universities plus private ones. It also has an interesting alternative culture and, in terms of things to do at night, everything from craft bar pubs to old man pubs to multi-storey nightclubs. It has massive shopping centres as well with more or less every chain store in the UK having a branch. 

* it's well connected, on the East Coast mainline around two and a half hours from London by train and the same time to Edinburgh in the north. It's also got Leeds Bradford Airport which is a major Ryanair hub for cheap flights to Europe. I flew to Milan from there myself for about thirty quid all in. What's more it's only 45 minutes from Manchester on the train which is even bigger with an even more comprehensive airport.

First.  Gotta love quoting the totally impartial NYT as a source ""proving"" that America had no involvement in the anti-democratic coup plot in Venezuela.

Second, how many dictators are democratically elected and submit themselves to regularly scheduled and internationally adjudicated as fair elections? US elections are probably open to much more criticism, if not for being rigged, for being bought.  The fact that you say he was a dictator shows that you have already completely bought in to the Western anti-progressive propaganda which always kicks into high gear when a country goes off the accepted global capitalist rails.  Every left wing leader in the global south has had to face it, no matter how democratic and how open and free they tried to keep heir society.

Third.  More objective outside observers [didn't think it was a conspiracy theory](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela).

As I said, 29% of MPs are women vs the theoretical optimal being 50%. The UK repeatedly voted for a female leader for ~10 years, and that was back in the 80's. There's still a bit of a way to go, but we're hardly miles off now. Women are represented heavily in politics today, and there are absolutely no barriers to them reaching the top. And this is despite the fact that women are generally less interested and knowledgeable about politics:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10154822/British-women-know-less-about-politics-than-men-but-why.html

And also less likely to vote:

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/08/female-parliamentary-candidates-rise-why-arent-women-voting

In both these articles, these facts are spun to be men's fault which is debatable but the facts are true regardless.

&gt; and fuck me, if you actually think that any of those things tarnish the ""feminist narrative""... christ.

They kinda do though don't they? I mean, feminists are saying that women are still hugely disadvantaged in society and yet we have many clear examples where the exact opposite is true. It doesn't really help the cause does it?

&gt; could you just define the feminist narrative for me please? preferably with the supporting academic work or writing.

It's whatever a woman wants it to be. I guess officially it's about equality between the sexes, but we're way way past that point now. In my eyes, feminism is about women retaining all of their traditional advantages, whilst also obtaining all the advantages men traditionally had, shedding any traditional female disadvantages and of course not taking on any of the male traditional disadvantages either. Basically the best of all worlds. Having their cake and eating it too.

For example: There's a big push to get women on the board of big companies, regardless of the fact that there is a huge lack of viable candidates. But I've not seen many feminists campaigning for women to work the hard, dangerous or generally crappy traditionally male roles such as becoming rubbish collectors, working on building sites etc.",null,0,null,1437472650,null,0,false,0,ctaq4aw,null,t3_3dxvpd,null,t1_ctaq4aw,null,t1_ct9yjm5,null,null,null,1440469589,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Virtually every other facet of those states has varied; geography, politics, econonomics, culture, with the only common factor being atheism. It's very difficult to look at that record and claim that the ideology of atheism was not responsible.
&gt; 

You do realise that most of those totalitarian states remove religion (or create their own) as it's a threat to the power structure? It's nothing to do with ""Atheist values"" but removing yet another organising structure from the threat list.

&gt; This is quite easy to demonstrate day to day; a quick look at r/atheism[1] or any mainstream atheist forum like ""The Brights"" will reveal shocking intolerance and abuse directed at believers, uncontested and without any corresponding peaceful voices.

Well a lot of those are reactionary American atheists who have a hard time in their home country. The amount of vitriol against atheists in America (they're the most distrusted group, ""coming out"" as Atheist can mean being kicked out by your parents) can be pretty bad, so I can see why there'd be a fair amount of resentment and hate back. Groups like the [BHA](https://humanism.org.uk/), and Atheists in the UK seem a lot more relaxed.

&gt; where are the atheist forums which are not dominated by ridicule, abuse and hate directed at believers?

Let's not forget Israel are relentlessly violated a huge amount of UN resolutions, including the Geneva convention building settlements on land which isn't theirs and dumping their waste onto adjacent farmland.

To add to that, they've been documented committing war crimes.

1) [Firing white phosphorous over residential areas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKgph9PV3SA), a chemical that rains from the sky and burns through flesh, cannot be put out by water.

2) [Using kids as human shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu63L7rYrg0) forcing them to stay in front of their armoured Humvees, sending them in first when performing house raids etc etc.

There are also countless reports of ex-IDF soldiers that say they systematically abuse Palestinian children abducting them from their homes and forcing them to confess to crimes they've never committed.

And what's more, THEY BOMBED A UN SCHOOL IN GAZA. Can you just imagine, for a split second, what would happen if Iran did something like that. There should be an overwhelming majority of people in the commons calling for economic sanctions to be put on Israel until they stop this extremely reckless illegal activity. Until they do, they are by definition a rogue state.

That was your entire comment, with the only 'they' possible to interpret as the 330,000 children who are going to be worse off.

&gt;Well, not every family,

Perhaps you should go for a more nuanced, thoughtful approach, rather than having to backtrack on your rhetoric. It will make you look less callous. 

&gt;a lot of these people fritter away their money on alcohol etc. 

'A lot' is a pretty vague target. Do you have any statistics, or are you just going with what you FEEL are the facts?

&gt;Just go to any of the shitty estates and you'll see plenty of people sitting around drinking lager and smoking roll ups

I'll see 'plenty' of people drinking lager and smoking roll ups, will I?

Again, there's nothing here that's factual. How many people 'smoke roll ups' or drink 'lager' in these 'shitty estates' and what percentage of their income is being spent? 

Or maybe those statistics don't matter to you. Maybe you'd rather go with your gut.

&gt;Those habits can be fairly expensive, 

Pretty ambiguous words here. How expensive is 'fairly' expensive. Again - how many people are spending what you feel is a disproportionate sum of money on these items. How much money would they save if they stopped? Would that be enough to solve their financial problems?

Or do you not know? Are you just guessing?

&gt;so I have little sympathy.

Well, that's fairly clear. You seem a little lacking in empathy as well. 

&gt;It reminds me of a vice documentary I watched that has a focus on food banks in the UK. They're interviewing people who are basically wringing about the state of the country and hope they're so poor, and then they go and light up.. 

Interesting. How many of these people did you see? 3? 4? Do you believe that's a representative sample to dismiss ~~all~~ ~~a lot~~  an indeterminate amount of families as at fault for their own food insecurity?

&gt;How much are cigs these days? 7 quid? Little sympathy for their self imposed escapable situation.

You have little sympathy for kids who do not have enough food to eat? 

Because you have decided that 'plenty' of their parents are not managing their money effectively.

Ok, well, that's one point of view I guess.

Let's pretend you DID care about these kids - consider it a thought experiment, I don't actually expect you to generate the human empathy required to ACTUALLY care about them...

That's a good point! Haha!

I'm quite an artistic person at heart and I've become really bored and fed up with the very saturation of images that you mentioned. I want something more from my photography. I want to make a photograph  that means something more to the viewer, a photograph that provokes a reaction good or bad. Obviously you can do that through conventional photographic means but trying to do that and get it to an audience that cares is very difficult. Personally I think it's not enough anymore to produce a nice photograph that you can put on a postcard and sell to the masses. We're constantly exposed to high quality, high definition photography that it doesn't hold the attention that it might have 10 years ago. I believe that people want more and I'm hoping that my twist on Impressionism might provide a spark that will interest people and give them something new to think about. 

This is why I chose the Liverpool waterfront. It's been photographed thousands of times but I felt I could add something different, something more than the postcard.

(3) Iheanacho is playing so brilliantly, its only 10 mins or so but every touch hes made has been smooth and the way he controls a difficult ball or a ball under pressure is superb

(4) Sagna doesnt offer anything in attack, he's solid defensivley but is horrible going forward, he keeps making small back passes when forward instead of attacking the ball and crossing it into the box like zaba does and iheanacho is forced to do the crossing

(5) The goal we conceded, though a powerfull shot, was poor on the part of cabellero, it was just above him he barely had to move, not too impressed with cabellero so far

BTW - what have the left-wing press done?

Edit:  Because I really try to be fair in my comments:  Looking at the Guardian I did find this in [a comment piece by Mohammed Shafiq](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/20/david-cameron-british-muslims-extremism-speech)

&gt;If freedom of speech is a great British value, as the prime minister claimed, then we must all fight any attempts to restrict it.

&gt;I abhor what Tommy Robinson and Anjem Choudary stand for and what they say, but removing Choudary’s right to free speech will restrict our ability to confront him. The government has plans to do away with the civil liberties of our citizens through the snooper’s charter; this legislation will affect all communities and must be resisted.

You should hopefully be able to get on the housing list as a priority - definitely speak with one of the charities linked above as they have the experience to help you do that in your interviews with the council.

Also, assuming you've never lived out of your mother's before, let us know if you would like some advice on renting a room or whatever.

Sometimes change only happens from strong leadership but there is a danger of going too far, undermining what is good and progressive. Conservatives are naturally drawn to what frustrates progress.

If someone who works a near-minimum wage job is seeing someone who is on benefits living a lifestyle equal, sometimes better, than them at least in terms of material possessions then trying to explain to them that this isn't so much a problem with benefits but the 'low-wage economy' won't get you far. I don't really think this happens anymore but I did live in a town with a big mix of demographic groups and you did see people working minimum-wage jobs finding they have no more spending power than their friends who left school and had a kid. 

The problem with the left is a failure to argue in real tangible terms to people and instead having academic 'big picture' arguments. It's the same with immigration. There is little point telling someone whose community has changed drastically, whose school has teachers spending longer on children whose first language isn't English and whose wages are being held down by cheaper workers that immigration is actually a net economic benefit to the wider country. It's true but it doesn't help them. 

The Tories can craft a message to the electorate that tells them how *they* will benefit. They directly addresses *their* concerns.

I found some more info from [Pink News](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/20/pride-event-bans-drag-queens-in-case-they-are-offensive/)

&gt; It continued: “It was felt by the group within the Trans/Non Binary Caucus that some drag performance, particularly cis drag, hinges on the social view of gender and making it into a joke, however transgender individuals do not feel as though their gender identity is a joke.

&gt; “This can particularly difficult for those who are not out and still present as the gender they were assigned at birth. While it was discussed whether we could have trans drag acts perform, it was agreed that as it would not be appropriate to ask any prospective drag acts whether or not they identified as trans.

Still nowhere does it use ""offend"". That word is a fucking dogwhistle.

Personally I still agree with the main Pride organisers:

&gt; “As an organisation Pride Glasgow had a similar discussion back in 2010 over how Drag could cause discomfort to people however we took the decision that Drag Queens and Kings play an important part in the history of the Pride movement and should be included within the event, so we used our Pride Guide to address these concerns by having a statement from Crosslynx (a Trans support organisation at the time) explaining that not everyone people would see in Drag at Pride would be Trans or represent the trans community.

&gt; “Pride Glasgow believes that any community group should be given their place to flourish but that success should not be built on the negativity and ignorance towards other events, groups and like minded people and we are saddened to see that this is the direction that Free Pride has chosen to take.""

I like Can, I really do, but this place is the only place I've seen him hyped like this. The lad has had a handful of decent (not fantastic) games and lads talk about him in here like he's the next big thing.

This might be unpopular in here but he isn't half the player this sub thinks he is and from what I've gathered from other fans, it seems this sub is the only place he's hyped like this. I can't see him ever nailing a regular spot down that will carry from season to season. He's a utility player, like it or not. He's good defensively, decent on the ball, tactically good and OKAY going forward despite the minds lost by fans over a few decent (and mindless) runs he makes with the ball but that's it. He's not outstanding at any one thing. 

In every position there's someone more suited or better at the job we need done in there. He's most similar to Hendo who is a far far better player. The fact that everyone in here is saying 'could he play here?' 'what about here?' Shows we don't really know what he is bar a utility player. 

Unfortunately lads, decent performances at u21 level don't always translate to senior level so I would be taking his summer performances with a pinch of salt.

Nicola Sturgeon made the point while in Brussels:

England is likely to vote No regardless of whether it triggers another Scottish referendum.

I once spent 5 days camping in the middle of a border crossing between Senegal and Mauritania because I refused to bribe the customs official 10 euros to sort my paperwork out ""quickly"" 

I crossed out of Senegal with out a hassle and got approached by ""The customs guy"" who had a uniform, collecting forms and was using it to his maximum advantage.  ""100 euros import"" he challenged. ""10 euros for tax"" was the next offer.  I kept saying no with a kinda tired weary look on my face.   The guy got the hump after about half an hour and said to come back later and wandered off to extort some poor truck driver or something. 

So I parked up in the middle of the strip, more or less blocked the road and waited whilst buses, trucks cars and hand carts tried to chaoticly manoeuvre round the Land Rover.  Every now and again I would wander back and the guy would wave me away with an annoyed look on his face so I would go back to the Landy and smile at the enraged truck drivers I was holding up, shrug my shoulders, say ""Un probleme avec les douanes"" (there's a problem with customs) , and point at the customs guy.  By the afternoon, people had taken to driving round me and squeezing up the narrow gap between the Landy and the customs post causing all sorts of hassle and chaos.

The border closed at 6.30 when it got dark, so I wandered over to the Senegalese side and started chatting to the border guards. Thinking I should stay on the right side of these guys, I found a tout and bought a crate of Flag Special beer to drink with them.  Another couple of crates later, fun was had by all, listening to Bob Marley on the radio and taking the piss out of the Mauritanians who were mooching about on the other side of the barrier.

The next day,  customs guy turns up again and pointedly stands behind the Landy, ignores me and spends the day taking paperwork and cash from other vehicles and waving them off down the gap between the customs shack the Landy.  I spent the day chilling and reading on top of the Landy, chatting to the touts and drivers who were milling around.  That night I bought some more beer and hung out with my new mates in Senagal.

The next few days followed a similar pattern, although occasionally a RIMer (Republique Islamique de Mauritanie) in a blue uniform would wander up, cadge a rollie and have a laugh about the customs guy with me.  I have become a fixture.  People sell me fruit and peanuts, I get to know the touts working the businessmen and I see drivers I recognise waving at me with a smile as they return across the border. 

On the 5th morning,  everything changed.  I got up as normal when it got light and made some coffee.  Whilst I was doing this, a blue uniformed RIMer wanders up and cadges a brew.  We chat for a bit about the weather.   It's going to be a lovely day, Its dry, sunny clear and bright, just as it has been for the last 50 years in this drought ridden part of the Sahel.  He asks politely if I wished to enter Mauritania and if he could see my passport.  Fine. I go with him into the customs shed where he sits in front of a large desk, writes my car reg in a big leather bound book and stamps my passport and says ""Welcome to Mauritania"" with a big shit eating grin on his face.

I go back to the Landy and start the engine.  I wave to my Senegalese mates and they start whooping and shouting  ""Vous etes libre!"" whist I drive under the stripy pole barrier and disappear North in a cloud of dust. 

TL/DR - I have been described as unreasonably stubborn in the past.

What is interesting though is back in the 70s when transgender as an identity was still being distinguished from ""common queens""; your drag queens, transvestites etc. they also tried to ban drag queens in NYC:

&gt;""Gay Pride organisers tried to ban transvestites from the parade in 1978 because after all, you turn on TV and there was a gay pride parade and all they show is the drag queens. So what Sylvia &amp; Marsha did, is they went ahead of the opening banner as two transvestites with some friends, they marched in front of the parade so it made them end up leading the whole parade! So the committee decided 'well, we've gotta start including transvestites in our parade'"" - Randolfe Wicker, Human Rights Activist 

&gt;""She would talk about how there was nobody to represent her and her rights as a transvestite, 'cause they had all these gay men and all these gay women working at the gay center, but they had no transvestites.

The kid, and I do mean kid, is 20 years old. In normal development terms he should still be playing Under-21 football. Relearning a different position at that age is not as difficult as some make it out to be. Hell, Lucas did it when he was a lot older, and he went from a no.10 in Brazil to a defensive mid under Rafa. You can point to his tactical ability, and you can argue that it took a couple of seasons, but with the squad we now have, we can afford to give Can the time to develop in to the role.

With all of that being said, I think it's actually about what Can WANTS to do.

Does he want to play as a defensive midfielder, or does he want to play as a box-to-box player?

If the former, then he will have to relearn the position, but he will probably ultimately be a more valuable player, and play as backup to Lucas. If the latter, then he will probably be fourth choice behind Hendo, Milner and Allen.

null,false,BritishLibrary,null,null,null,"Firstly, I'd be really totally honest about our actual outgoings. I'd set a line by line budget value for each of the entertainment and food outgoings you have. I imagine your current spending cuts out quite a lot of this extra £500.

And then:

**Credit Card** - 26% is a really high rate, even with the reduction. Over the course of a year thats about £400 in interest charges. What kind of repayments are you making on this? If it's the minimum, you're barely paying any of the actual balance off and you'll take much longer to reduce this debt.

I would see if you can get a 0% Balance Transfer offer for another credit card to reduce this. Take a look on MSE for options. This means any money you pay towards your card will hit the balance directly. (Note - with Barclay card, their minimum charge is 1% plus interest per month - £12 + about £25 interest. - The more you can pay over the minimum, the more you will save in interest later).

Secondly, increase payments above the minimum - what's the most you can afford after your other expenditure? 

Currently, it looks as though your credit it your highest APR debt, so focus your payments here. If you can get this on a 0% balance transfer this will give you more flexibility.

Between now and October you need to save £100 / month for your Argos debt, and about £80 for your Very debt. What happens at the end of the term, if you haven't paid these? I expect these will have greater consequence than your existing credit card debt if you fail to pay them?

And with your overdraft, do you have any interest on this or are you currently in a grace period due to your recent graduate status? I expect if you are paying interest, you may be getting a better rate than your credit card.

So I would suggest trying to prioritise your debts, and working a plan to get rid of them. Assuming your two Pay Later debts will have the greatest impact if you fail to pay them, I would prioritise those, then Credit, then Overdraft. 

As a rough split:

July| August | September | October| November| December| total| Debt
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
£100| £100| £100 | - | - | - | **£300** | Argos
£80 | £80 | £80 | £180 | £180 | - | **£600** | Very
£50 | £50 | £50 | £50 | £50 | £230 | **£480** | Credit Card
£15 | £15 | £15 | £15 | £15 | £15 | **£90** | Overdraft
 | | | | | | | 
£245|£245|£245|£245|£245|£245|£1470||

**But** first and foremost. You need a budget. You need to plan your spending, then spend to your plan. Of your £500 remaining, you need to find a way to prioritise as much as you can to your debt. If you can get to a £245 / month you can pay off about £1400 by the end of the year. Some of that will go to interest, so if you can do a balance transfer you will be better for it. 

/r/YNAB is a great resource (and piece of software) to help you plan a budget and reduce your debts.

The Tories won the largest share of the vote. Forming a losers coalition was impossible numbers wise, and would have been a disaster as public opinion was hugely against Labour and Gordon Brown. They could have refused to go into coalition, at a time of huge economic uncertainty in the UK plunging us further into recession. The Tories would have formed a minority government, and struggled through for maybe a year, not able to do anything. Our economic position would have become worse and the public would have become even more scared. Another election would have been called incredibly quickly in which the Tories would have been the only party with enough money to run any kind of campaign. And could have blamed all the uncertainty on the Lib Dems and Labour. We would have almost certainly then have elected a Conservative Majority government and be where we are now, but 5 years ago.

They're also more likely to benefit from networking so they get a better chance of netting a good graduate job. When they do start to repay, they'll have less to pay back and will have had a leg up getting there. 

If a kid from a low-income background goes to uni, they will have to take out a loan to fund their studies, will likely have a harder time getting a grad job (no old boys network, parents less likely/able to support during the intermediate period) and when they do they will have more to pay back. Assuming the two kids from this example did the same course, got the same grades and went into the same jobs after graduation, why is it fair for the kid with the advantage to have less to pay back?

It's completely convoluted. It's actually possible, if you're near the borderline, to be paying back student debt **and** have the amount of money you owe increase due to inflation/compound interest. Depending on what you earn, there is either an incentive to make overpayments and pay back less overall, or pay as little as possible because you'll never have any hope of paying it off. 

To be honest, if the main defence of this policy is that most graduates will never earn enough for repayments to worry them, then why the hell are we sending them to uni? Surely the government should just withdraw all support for degrees as a stop-gap between school and employment in the retail industry, make university affordable for degrees that have value in the job market, have some kind of serious commitment to non-academic training and make sure there is skilled work for people to go into. 

Two immediately more fair options spring to mind for funding universities; 

 * Implement a graduate tax. The amount you pay is only ever tied to post-study earnings. 

 * Let university be free (or at least cheap, on the order of £500 per year or so. Pretty much every other European country manages this). If our universities are working properly, then the average graduate should earn more than the average non-graduate. That means we on balance should generate tax revenue from graduates and that university courses are an economic investment (as they ought to be). 

The problem is that the government doesn't see a university as an economic investment. They see it as a cash cow and as an excuse to ignore the fact there is no real coherent plan for integrating young workers into the economy. They treat the symptom of this by taking more money off people who (admittedly misguidedly) go to uni but the problem still remains.",null,0,null,1437479131,null,0,false,0,ctarshn,null,t3_3e1ty0,null,t1_ctarshn,null,t1_ctappmb,null,null,null,1440469489,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

What makes a British citizen less of a security risk than a person coming in from France to work in London, but with a conviction for vandalism 5 years ago? The British citizen could be someone with a history of arrest for creating sectarian graffiti in the past. Currently the free travel area isn't actually extended over the whole of Europe - our decisions are made based on our assessment of whether the country in question is safe to allow for visa free travel. So if we judge the security situation in the whole of a given EU member state to be equal to or better than our own then it seems very sensible to allow them to come and go without being subjected to a background check. 

The real checks should come if an EU resident wants to take up work in a sensitive profession (eg. teaching) or wants to access services that are dependent on some kind of good behaviour. We can save immense cost and potentially lost productivity by centralising our databases and putting faith in our counterparts in the other EU policing services to do their jobs properly. If we can't then we can easily envision that they wouldn't be in the visa free zone anyway. British citizens do have plenty more rights in the UK, but I don't envision the right to enter and reside without a police check as being one such right that is exclusive to our own people.

* Kids in hospital being told by their traveller parents that they're going to get their jaw broken.
* The younger teenagers that are already perfecting their 'orange tramp look'
* Where we live, as soon as travellers rock up, all the horses in the nearby stables are locked up, otherwise they're ridden with ropes and mistreated overnight 'for fun' (happened again last week).
* Another 'feature' of when they arrive is that the amount of local flytipping goes up by a great deal (starting from previously 'not happening at all'). Of course, when they leave it stops.

You're comparing printing a topless photo on the inside of a newspaper to putting hardcore pornography on milk-cartons?  Well, OK.

Look, I don't read the Sun, and I get my pornography from the internet like everyone else.  But, I am concerned about the Page 3 campaigners.  Used to be that it was the religious right who campaigned against nudity.  Now it's the feminists.  And honestly, I don't see why one is wrong and not the other.  If you support free-speech principles then you should support them for everyone - including those you disagree with.

Really, I think it's a class thing.  Sun readers are perceived as lower class and the middle classes think that they should get to decide what's best for them.  But, if the tables were reversed and it was Sun readers objecting to nudity in middle class publications or art galleries then there would be OUTRAGE.

That aside I think while Cameron may not become a war criminal, the damage done by mass privatisation can quickly get out of hand. It takes bloody ages and a lot of money to build large public organisations, but not long at all to sell them off.

My deepest fear is that in one term bought by cleverly misdirected ire the Tories will manage to accomplish near-as-true total destruction of public organisations like the BBC, Post Office (already a done deal), schools and yeah, the NHS. 

Last time it was the houses, public transport and industry, this time I fear it will be media, communications, health and education. Oh and throw in the tearing down pillars of welfare while people starve too.

What I do see happening though is devolution of powers, which normally I'd support entirely if I weren't AGAIN afraid, afraid that Cameron is so eager to devolve powers to Scotland and thus divide the electorate sufficiently to cement his party as the top cat in a one party 'democracy' that is England, which is all they care about really.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"Very familiar with DPA. You should perhaps study up on the [DPA Principles](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/schedule/1). Schools processing data on an individual's disciplinary background is a lawful and relevant activity.

The DPA does *absolutely nothing* to prevent a school - for instance - asking for a reference from an individual's previous school and the previous school stating that they were expelled for beating up classmates or violent behaviour.

Just as schools and 6th form colleges provide a reference in support of UCAS Applications. It's absolutely not illegal to provide a reference of that nature.

DPA does not prevent a data handling entity making *factually accurate* statements regarding an individual where there is a proper reason for doing so.

It merely requires Data Handlers to only collect relevant data, protect the data, only process it for lawful and reasons and ensure it's destruction when it ceases to be relevant.

See [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/schools/pupils-info/) for information from the ICO on School Records.

[quote]As a parent, what sort of information can I access?

If your child attends a maintained school, you have a right to access your child’s educational record. This covers information that comes from a teacher or other employee of a local authority or school, the pupil or you as a parent, and is processed by or for the school’s governing body or teacher, except for information the teacher has solely for their own use. So it will cover information such as the records of the pupil’s academic achievements as well as correspondence from teachers, local education authority employees and educational psychologists engaged by the school’s governing body. It may also include information from the child and from you, as a parent. Information provided by the parent of another child would not form part of a child’s educational record.[/quote]

Notice the bit about information from Local Education Authorities? The other thing is that the power of head teachers to make expulsions has been curtailed in recent years, requiring sign-off for certain things from their LEA. Ergo, certain disciplinary data, as well as things like Statements of Special Education Needs (where schools are sharing SEN resources) are going to be floating at an LEA level, not a school level, and could be made available to other schools where relevant.",null,0,null,1437480375,null,0,1437481151,0,ctas73b,null,t3_3dyt3s,null,t1_ctas73b,null,t1_ctarpu8,null,null,null,1438052501,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

Should we allow someone with a history of soliciting child prostitutes to go on holiday to Thailand? No. But we shouldn't be so harsh to offenders with lesser crimes, nor should we expect that offenders of all colours should be disbarred from the UK. 

If an EU citizen is subject to some kind of probation limiting movement in their own country then it's reasonable that they should be prohibited from travelling to the UK, and should be sent back to custody in their country of origin if they turn up one day. That doesn't require a blanket ban on travel without checks, however. Sharing of information gives us the ability to selectively disbar from the UK anyone subject to charges or a control order elsewhere in the UK, whilst letting law abiding citizens pass. If a British citizen decides to snap off their angle tag and hop on the next plane to Madrid then we should also expect that they'll wind up on a plane back in short order.

In the UK we have the nearly unique (shared with Ireland) benefit of still having passport checks and controls to EU nationals attempting to enter the UK. The degree of control that gives us is probably enough to allay most of your concerns, as we can screen for criminals anyway. I'm not so worried about arseholes going in or out of the UK so long as they're not committing very serious crimes. Sometimes we just can't tell which tourist or economic migrant is going to commit a crime until they do it, and I have no issue with billing another EU state for the expense of locking up their citizens for shoplifting or drunk &amp; disorderly and arranging them travel home.

That's not the case with any *actual* tax. The tax I paid as a 14 year old, buying a packet of fags on the sly (I didn't, it's an example, calm down), I'll pay as a 99 year old. 

I find the ""it's not a loan, it's a tax"" argument nothing but a convenient way of inuring people to accepting this huge mountain of debt - and making it easier to pile on even more over time. It's a loan you have to pay back. Whether or not you notice it being paid back is irrelevant. Calling it a tax is sophistry and a dangerous falsehood.

If you had an overdraft of £50k+, if you were never in credit, if you were being forced to live your life in debt to the bank, would it not keep you awake at night, even with a perfectly reasonable repayment scheme?

Most French citizens are as law abiding as ours, so I don't see the point in doing a background check if a Frenchman comes here to work in some London firm (London is one of the 'largest French cities', after all).

I think that second statement is a strawman argument. I appreciate the need for borders, but I think some borders should be less stringent that others. We have a 'border' in some sense between Wales and England based on differing laws and administrations, but this border isn't significant enough to bar free movement. Within the EU we have free movement within reason, with people free to enter without giving notice to us about their plans to arrive, but still subject to passport and records checks on arrival. 

I'm certainly not anti-Parliamentary, but I do believe in the spread of power to authorities best qualified to deal with it. Mostly that means power to local people in counties and cities, but sometimes it means deciding among European countries about product standards or massive infrastructure projects that we best decide together. All of these levels should be held to account democratically. Our 'country' is called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that's what it says on my passport. I owe alliegance to no other entity, but I have a great deal of fondness for England nevertheless. If we in the UK were in a situation where the EU's needs were incompatible with ours then it would make perfect sense to weaken ties, but for now the EU serves our needs pretty well.

I feel incredibly lucky as I started university one year before the fee hikes. I studied with the Open University and have barely had to pay anything due to grants for low income. Even with the Open Uni, which is significantly cheaper than a regular university, had I been just one year younger I would now be £15000 in debt. That's the difference just one year in age makes, or one gap year, whatever...starting off your life with no debt, vs starting with thousands. 

Yes in America students are always in debt from studying. And maybe that will from now on be the case in the UK. But to grow up being told university is the only way to go (and if you're not a completely rubbish student, most schools will push you into going to uni), and thinking that you would get grants or minimal loans...to suddenly realising that you will come out of it in debt for your whole life...that's jarring.

And to be honest university doesn't guarantee anything these days. When my parents went to uni - my mum was the first in her family to do so - they were pretty much guaranteed a job afterwards. A lot of their school year didn't go to university. But now, most school leavers go to uni, having a degree is nothing special - and will leave you in masses of debt - but it's expected of you.

The reason why 70% of the public support it is because the conservatives won the PR war in 2010. They promoted austerity very effectively and Labour didn't publicly propose an alternative, although they had been trying to stimulate the economy in the 2008-10 period and it had shown signs of early success. When Brown went that all stopped and we had the 'double-dip' in 2011-12.

Labour did try to counter with 'our plan *was* working until you messed it all up with austerity' but by then the barn door was already wide open and the horse had bolted. The public believed austerity was the only way forward and Labour had no economic credibility because of 2008.

We then find ourselves in the current situation, where Labour have no option (in their view) but to support a policy that they disagreed with in the past (as discussed, goes against their core values, hurts the poor/working class, etc). Which is why people view them as being hypocritical and weak.

The differences between the two aren't actually that great, although the American House of Cards obviously raises the stakes somewhat. You may be interested to know that House of Cards was actually originally written about the House of Commons by a British author, and there's a very good TV series of the British version that was made in the early 90's (think it's all on Netflix).

Anyway, the Whips Office (for they are plural - they have a Chief Whip) are there to ensure that members of which ever political party they belong to vote in that direction. Each week, the Whips office will send out a circular to the members of its respective party telling them which way to vote. Each issue will be underlined either once, twice or three times depending on how important it is to vote that way. Defying any whip gets you in bother, and you'll get a smack on the wrist for doing so. 

If you defy a three line whip, you can end up in serious trouble and may be expelled from the party. Note, however, that you are still an MP, as parties and MPs are technically separate. The action that will be taken against you probably depends on how many of your colleagues took your view, and on your past behaviour. 

As a general point, however, one wonders why you would want to be a member of a party whose whip you would constantly defy as, in such a case, your views would appear not to match the party's remotely. 

Note: If you harbour ambition, you do not defy your Whip, as the Whip is dictated by your party's leader/cabinet. You're unlikely to be promoted if you're unwilling to follow the party line.

To many people £29,500 is a great salary and is more than either of my parents have earned. Of course graduates will earn more than most people so they can afford it, as you said the median income is only ~£24,000 so at £29,500 you are better off than at least 50% of people, more likely 60%. 

Also lets put your figures in context, if you paid back £37,000 of debt after working 30 years with an average salary of £29,500 then you have paid back £37,000 out of £885,000, or just 4% of your earnings. Hardly a huge amount considering you wouldn't be getting that much money to begin with if you hadn't gone to university.

Then there is the fact the threshold was raised from £17k for me to £21k for you, that means that if we both got £29,500 a year I would be paying about 50% more in loan repayments a year than you (£1125 compared to £765). So even if you have more debt, I am hit harder at the beginning of my professional career than you. 

**TL;DR** You don't pay a penny unless you are better off than 40% of people (£21k). The percent of your total earnings going to the graduate tax will be tiny and increases if you have a higher income. The new threshold means that post-2012 students are better off when they come out of university and their repayments are lower and more spread out. 

As an aside, the best system would be to get rid of this system of loans and instead give all students a grant which covers fees and living costs, then all graduates pay a graduate tax on income above £21k. Even better would be if the each graduate's tax went directly to their university so that universities have an incentive to teach marketable skills along side the degrees to improve their graduate's salaries.

You may argue about emotional harm to those close, but we don't legislate relationships. You have a right to do something that upsets someone else close to you. If you disagree, would you ban bad breakups or cheating?

You may argue about criminal harm,  but that's a separate offence and already covered. Just like alcohol, if you know something may make you break the law you take the responsibility for the acts. 

The other point is about safety. During prohibition cost of all drugs has fallen and quality has gone up. That's what happens in every case of prohibition everywhere. Legalisation allows for regulation and safety measures. No mixing of drugs with other things, no random strength. Imagine walking into a pub and all you can ask for is ""a pint"" and that pint could be anything from water to rum and all in between. Not only that but in some cases you had to down the whole thing at once and wait for the effects. Now imagine what our image of alcohol would be if that were the case. 

The final argument is taking a huge bunch of British citizens engaged in criminal behaviour and making them tax paying entrapenuers. Stopping the entry point for so many kids into criminal gangs. Choking off the money supply for terrorism and organised crime. If selling groceries were illegal, do you seriously think the equivalent of ASDA and Tesco wouldn't be shooting at each other and other criminal behaviour?

You can put limits on different drugs in terms of strength, labelling, advertising, where you can take them, who can sell them. Something like heroin might be in a controlled environment with a trained medical assistant. Current laws for alcohol in terms of behaviour in a public place and at work would still apply. Money raised could go into efforts to reduce usage and offset harm. You could at the same time limit alcohol advertising.  

Without full legalisation you just squeeze the balloon and push demand and profit elsewhere. With it you gain influence on the whole supply chain and revenue.

Edit: thought of one more point. What other new industry would create jobs and local businesses across the country, in towns and rural areas, without fail? If you're not sure about this. Have a look at how many ""hydroponic"" shops have popped up by you recently. I'll give you a hint, theres not been a huge increase in the home grown tomato market in the last decade. Now imagine each one was supplying a local business. What else has that coverage?

You requested an order, they agreed to fulfil it in exchange for the price, meaning the contract had been formed, and then you've performed your side of the deal while they've completely failed to do so with theirs. 

Of particular interest here could be the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which in Schedule 1, under the title 'commercial practices that are in all circumstances considered to be unfair', lists at para. 5: ""Making an invitation to purchase products at a specified price without disclosing the existence of any reasonable grounds the trader may have for believing that he will not be able to offer for supply, or to procure another trader to supply, those products or equivalent products at that price for a period that is, and in quantities that are, reasonable having regard to the product, the scale of advertising of the product and the price offered (bait advertising).""

Just to be clear, IANAL and the whole thing will pretty much entirely hinge on what exactly those T&amp;Cs say, but I'd say you probably have a case.

I doubt very much he'll stick around for long. He'll also backtack on much of the manifesto and find excuses to avoid carrying through policies that are particularly stupid.

I also think that the Tory party has let the unexpected nature of their election victory go to their heads - remember the main two parties in the last General Election barely changed their overall share of the vote from their 2010 results, all the action was with the death of the Lib Dems, rise of UKIP, Labour losing Scotland, the Green surge and so on. The vagaries of our electoral system flatter to decieve. 

In his favour however is the Labour party is almost certainly going to split into two parties. If it stays together it will be unleadable. 

The left-wingers faced with the problem that much of the country is supportive of the principle of Osborne's welfare reforms. I've seen polling which shows that people are very willing to support welfare reform when it's a semi-abstract notion, targetting the ""scroungers"" we see plastered all over the TV and the newspapers etc, but once it gets specific and you ask someone ""do you want to lose your housing benefit"" or ""do you want your local swimming baths to close"" and so on they change their tune. People are always willing to support benefit cuts when it's for *them* (whoever they are) but once you get specific support drops rapidly. The Bedroom Tax is a great example - at the time of it's introduction it was supported by a slim majority according to YouGov, but as it was implemented it got less and less popular, and by the GE Labour felt comfortable enough to feature its repeal as one of their leading policies.

The right-wingers are faced with the problem that even if they move to the centre, without being able to win back Scotland or areas of the north where they lose to both Green and UKIP they can't win a majority. Even if they pick up another 30 or 40 marginal seats in ""aspirational"" middle-England that's still not going to be enough to counteract the affect of the SNP in Scotland. And unlike in 1997, those traditional Labour voters can not be relied upon to turn up and tribally vote Labour, they'll either stay at home (as they did this time round) or vote for another party. They can't take that for granted any more.

So Cameron's going to take advantage of this early honeymoon period where his party is briefly united and Labour is weak to ram through the most ill-thought out and controversial bits of his program. So the foxhunting, welfare cuts, BBC reform, the EU referendum business, he'll try and get that outta the way quickly so he can put his feet up and retire sometime around 2017-18.

*You have to let yourself go to be creative. Children possess this quality but then seem to lose it as they are told, ""it's not the done thing"". Pablo Picasso summed it up well; ""Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up"".*

*The answer is simple. Never grow up. I don't mean don't become an adult with responsibility and the weight of the world on your shoulders. I simply mean if you're writing or directing give yourself enough time to play. Play the fool. Goad. Shock. Laugh. Trip over something that isn't there. Try something. And never be afraid to fail. That failure is useful too. It's just another building block.*

*Fame can curb your playful streak in the same way as adulthood, as it's another form of societal pressure. This is dangerous as comedy at some level always has an element of undermining normality. The reason fame can stifle this is because reputation suddenly matters more. Now, it's not just some idiot annoying everyone in the pub, it's that idiot Ricky Gervais. I didn't care about strangers thinking I was an idiot before because they didn't know me. Now, they think they do. But, I've realised something.

If your speech is controversial there may very well be strong consequences for you by saying it, but that doesn't deny you the right all the same.

______________________________________________________________

Obviously, Stella's all about the community organising, so it's not surprising that she focusses on that. Here, she's mainly talking about how our campaigning during election time should be informed by our community work during all other times, invoking Joe Hill's famous dictum of 'Don't mourn, organize'.

&gt;one of the lessons we must also take from our election defeat is a willingness to ask if our campaigning approach, which saw thousands of volunteers working incredible hours to knock thousands of doors, needs to change too. Too often, a member’s knock at the door will be greeted with a reply that ""we only ever see you at election time – you just want one thing""

She's not the first to offer a similar critique of our campaigning, which was heavy on boots on the ground and low on actual interaction. She argues that community work is the way to fix this and that we can make a difference when we're not in power:

&gt;Being out of office does not mean we are out of power – we can campaign now for change to show the public what we stand for.

She suggests this is a win-win: We help communities now *and* in doing so we make it more likely we'll win and find ourselves able to do still more to help them.

She then offers some suggestions of how this can be brought about using the structures we have now (and adding some new ones):

&gt;That’s why I am proposing measures such as a development officer for Young Labour, to help us build the leadership skills of our younger members and supporters to be able to in turn recruit their peers to Labour.

A decent idea to engage more young people with Labour and politics in general.

&gt;We also need an academy for campaigning to help build the skills and networks of future Labour activists including councillors, organisers and CLP secretaries.

A similar idea. It'll be interesting to see exactly what form these take.

&gt;advances in technology make it possible to change the way we campaign, so that we can really get to the heart of what makes voters tick, and build long term relationships with them as individuals

Stella already has a decent [discussion area](http://www.stellacreasy.org.uk/discussion/) on her website, showing one way we can use technology more effectively than in the past.

&gt;As well as a dedicated diversity fund to support the involvement of those currently underrepresented in our movement...

(Which would presumably include youth, as mentioned above...)

&gt;... I want us to directly match-fund new campaigns and projects to engage with communities

Another actual policy suggestion. Again, I think this is a good idea. We have the [membersnet campaign area](http://members.labour.org.uk/home) but it doesn't work that well. Stella seems to have some serious ideas about making it work properly, which crucially includes trusting people with money!

She ends with a fairly standard call to action, asking people to support her.

_______________________________________________________

I think that all sounds excellent. The role of Deputy Leader is traditionally a bit vague: What Stella is essentially proposing is to make it into head of community organising for Labour. I think that sounds like a perfect use for the role, as it will a) mean we're taking community organising seriously, as we should do, and b) give a high profile to all our community campaigns.",null,0,null,1437484487,null,0,false,0,ctatt92,null,t3_3e1muk,null,t1_ctatt92,null,t3_3e1muk,null,null,null,1438053604,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

I'm sure she does understand the difference, but, to me at least, in this quote she seems to equate being Jewish and not recognising Palestinian statehood. Whether she meant that, or not, that's certainly how it comes across. 

Just out of interest, if you do support a two-state solution, why wouldn't you support recognising Palestine? Surely upholding the Palestinian Authority to the same expectations (rights as well as responsibilities) as the Israeli government will make a just two-state solution more likely, wouldn't it?

It just seems to me that the Tory government policy seems to be ""if a problem is difficult to solve, privatize it and let it be someone else's"". Which is fine, except when it's a public utility. Solve the problem and make the entity work for the electorate, don't pass it on to a private enterprise, that's not in public interest. Yeah it saves tax, but then whoever gets the PO will be charged tax, which they will then pass on to the consumer, with a load of overhead and for-profit shenanigans on top.

As for the BBC, I should have been more specific. I'm worried about the proposal that changed the funding model and subsequent agreement with the BBC, specifically the proposal to change to a tariff based model (which to my understanding basically turns the BBC into Sky). Again with the ""privatize the complex and scary things"" mentality. 

I think currently the BBC is a unique entity in that it's state media that is independent from the state, and that should remain intact. From my understanding, and conversations I've had within the BBC, the corporation is not state owned - it's association with the government comes in where the government agreed to compel people to pay TV Licenses. In exchange the BBC has to provide balanced, unbiased news coverage, programming for everyone, and programming with merit (generally educational), and will not include adverts. For me, this arrangement absolutely has to remain. I completely accept that the state of broadcasting has changed more than anyone could have known when that charter was written, but rather than talk about changing the funding model, talk about the ""broadcast for everyone"" clause, and also what it means to broadcast. Allow the BBC more freedom in what it can and cannot show, and allow it to exclusively broadcast niche content online. Again this is just some ideas, a proper discussion needs to be had by people more qualified than I.

The NHS is a cumbersome beast, in many ways it is hampered by both its age and size. I think it's become clear that whatever is needed to make it truly efficient will involve fundamental changes from the very foundation of the NHS. Of course the issue here is that if said changes don't work... People die, or rather, more people. Look at models used in Switzerland and the Netherlands, both more efficient than the NHS, both newer and less cumbersome. Yeah, the suggestion of ""make is better and more efficient"" is as obvious as it is useless, the real question is ""how?"". I don't know the answer, but I'd rather the government try and figure it out how to make it cost-effective than the private sector try and figure out how to make it profitable.

Step two - get on to the housing executive/ benefits office and get what you can - it won't be paid immediately but you'll get the ball rolling.

Step three - Talk to the Simon Community. They have various hostels around Belfast but if you're under 25 they have a fantastic one on the Malone road beside Methody. They'll be able to support you through your ordeal and the staff are fantastic.

Step four - it may take a while to get into a hostel. Through the welcome organisation you'll be able to get a bed and a hot meal at the night shelter. They'll bus you from the Welcome centre to the night shelter beside Custom House Square where you'll queue for half an hour.

Most opinion polling shows that this area remains a top priority for many Jews and Muslims, so I don't think she's crazy to suggest that there's a link, there. Certainly she's not alone in doing so.

As for the two-state solution, I do support it, but I honestly don't know where I stand on when it's appropriate to recognise Palestine. Some people argue that when it's being ruled by Hamas, an internationally-recognised terrorist group, it's not a great time to say that it's a state.

Others suggest that until the status of Jerusalem is solved (both Israel and Palestine claim it as their capital), recognising Palestinian statehood will do more harm than good.

Still more say that recognising Palestine simply won't achieve anything: Unless there's a negotiated peace, Israel can simply carry on doing what it's doing while refusing to recognise Palestinian statehood (it's no stranger to flouting UN conventions, after all), and that recognising Palestine will make it harder to get Israel to negotiate a peace, not easier.

Overall, I'm extremely glad I'm not a politician so I don't have to take a firm position on this. My point is simply that Liz Kendall's position on Palestinian statehood should not necessarily be regarded as support for Israel in general or support for the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and *certainly* not as support for every action the Israeli government has ever undertaken.",null,0,null,1437485364,null,0,false,0,ctau7r7,null,t3_3e1w9q,null,t1_ctau7r7,null,t1_ctattsc,null,null,null,1438053933,null,4,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,4,null

It would be beneficial for both Stones and Everton for him to stay another season and Im sure both parties are aware of this. With this season Stones can guarantee (100%) first team football for him, which he cannot if he leaves for Chelsea. On top of that if he impresses next season better offers for him may come and he can guarantee a better spot in his future team. If he stays another season his value wont really go down (unless he starts playing shit, which he probably wont) since he signed a new contract and if he plays well Im sure Everton can sell him for more than 32m(?). 

Im not too hurt, ever since I heard the hype around him when Moyes got him Ive had a hunch he was due for great things.

Hi all!

Thanks for the support so far, the venue is fantastic, got a [photo update](http://imgur.com/a/FNcWQ) of the interior for you!

The screen is massive, the photos don't do it justice, being 10am with the lights on, but its approximately 3m wide, and the projector is of course 1080p.

The bar boasts up to 16 kegs, and 6 casks, including 4x tanks of Pilsner Urquell floating above the main door.

You can get an idea of the space from the panorama, we're hiring in tables and chairs and reconfiguring the booths to make the most of it, for the ultimate (press R!) viewing experience.

We've also learnt we can offer full table service on the night, so food and drinks will come to you!

We look forward to seing you there and watching some awesome DOTA, please retweet, facebook, whatever us, and make this a pubstomp to remember!

Walcott was far better at 19 though, he was playing 30+ games a season from the age of 17/18 and by Ibe's age had already played around 110 games for Arsenal..

Dealings so far seem to be quite targeted. The two of the three main issues look to be being remedied, that is: lack of defensive depth, glut of less-than-stellar midfielders. The third issue, still apparently to be considered, is to find a reliable alternate for Harry Kane. I'm surprised we've sold defensive midfielders, unless they were deemed incapable. With Stambouli gone, Bentaleb is now the only player native to that position.

**Players:**

I don't think we can honestly say what the best XI now is. There are still player who have already cemented their starting place. There appears to now be more competition for certain places.

Sciennes and Meadow Court are both self-catered flats, meaning that you'll be living in flats of 4-6(?) and preparing your own meals (or eating out). They are both about a 10 minute walk to the George Square campus. 

Meadow Court is located across the road from Sciennes, and in my opinion the two are quite similar. Sciennes has a relatively new and rather misused common room, and I'm not sure if Meadow Court has a common room. I do know, however, that every flat in Meadow Court has a television in the kitchen, unlike that of Sciennes. 

I'm pretty sure neither of the buildings have lift access, but there are ground-floor flats (which may be susceptible to break-ins).

You cannot accuse the public of missing the point. Under Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, the Labour Party has increasingly defined itself increasingly as being a voice for those on benefits.

Furthermore, in describing a country that is mired in poverty as a result of callous Government cuts, many Labour voices describe a world that does not ring true to C1/C2 voters – people that are not poor but not rich and that carefully watch everything they spend. Clearly poverty exists in this country and the parties have a moral duty to tackle it; that is not the point.

“We had email exchanges which have been contradicted, so that’s made it very complicated. It’s difficult. The Tottenham board’s theory is to explain that the economic market is very hard and so we have to get used to renegotiating.
“It’s been very, very difficult. I’ve got 25 years of experience as a president of a club and it’s our 16th participation in a European competition in a row. But this is very rare in the football world. The negotiation with the Tottenham directors has been the hardest I have ever had to undergo in these 25 years.”

There is a monolithic band of mainstream thought defined mainly by what big business wants. They have the money to spend on advertising, on lobbying, on media ownership. The debate that you see on tv and in the newspapers is a debate within that school of mainstream thought. 

Overton imagined this band of thought as a window through which the audience(s) are shown a representation of the world. on either side of the window is blank wall as if nothing exists outside of the window.

Over time the window has moved to show more of the right-wing argument than the left, with the result that what was once well within the window is now regarded as 'loony-left' material. This includes things like nationalised industries and trade unions.

At the present time the Welfare State is drifting toward the left edge of the window. By the time I die I expect it to be gone under the constant attacks from big business leaders. It's funny, when you think of people like the Koch Brothers, exporting their brand of capitalism to the world by funding think-tanks and lobbying in various parliaments I can't help but think of Saudi Arabian princes and businessmen funding Wahhabi inspired Islam to various other places. 

And it's all in the name of the same thing: Conservatism. Tradition. Keeping people in their place.

So the instances you cite of the right-wing trying to silence the left-wing aren't a passing annoyance but neither are they a flashpoint; there's an ongoing class struggle and much as the popular meme expects those on the left to be 'triggered' by these things we tend to view them with a somewhat sour amusement.

I tell you what you do.

null,false,Lou3000,flair1,,null,"Transfers have been encouraging so far because they show a willingness to craft the squad regardless of squeezing pennies out of sales.  I'm going to go against the grain and say that CM/CDM is not our first priority, rather we desperately need a WF and a striker.  Ideally we'd sign both, but Berahino is really my first choice right now as he can be a solo striker, play up front with Kane, or even slide over into LW.  Martial was originally on the top of my list for the same reason.  Obviously in a perfect world we sign a fantastic CM, a young/pacey LW, and a solid backup to Kane. 

Chiriches, Lennon and Adebayor are obviously on my transfer list.  If Townsend can accept the super-sub role, then I'm okay with keeping him.  I really don't know where the club stand with Carroll, but at 24 and still struggling to make the first team, he seems like he's on his way out.

My XI is the same as the favored XI at the end of the season.  I think Lamela is due to become a solid star.  His progression has been slow, but very steady.  Think about where he was 1.5 years ago.  I think Mason and Walker are the make-or-break players this season.  If Mason can keep his Scum/Chelski form from last season, he could be immense.  If Walker can stay fit and remember how to defend, he can be a major component.  I don't see any regression.  We're selling the players that were regressing.

* China is a developing (stage 2, or stage 2-3) economy. It relies on siphoning off investment from the developed world to grow. The reason growth has slowed from double digits is because they are hitting the limits to where this is possible, and will need to look towards making world leading products to avoid stagnating.

* India is not even a stage 2 economy. Their agricultural sector is broadly the same as it was 500 years ago, very low mechanisation, very low investment and medieval land ownership laws. Their manufacturing base is languishing as key infrastructure is missing. Wierdly, they have a surprisingly modern service sector, but that alone does not constitute development. Bangaladesh will be a more modern economy than India in 20 years if things continue.

* Productivity is a key issue that remains unadressed. Much of this comes down to lacking infrastructure and poor labour mobility. The longer these issues remain unadressed, the further from the US the UK will be.

* Wages are growing, net migration to the UK is low. Your statement is demonstrably false.

* This is due to stagnant productivity. The UK must invest, and the UK government must invest.

* Developing countries grow fast, they can use other nation's advances and have 50 years of growth in a decade. Factor exports are also growing as China and the US recovers, causing undeveloped countries to have high GDP growth - though this is not likely to improve living standards for the majority of their people.

* As above. Poland is also a developing (stage 2-3) economy, like China.

* We're 9th, bearing in mind that 2nd and 7th are city states. If we could improve our productivity base, we could easily be 3rd or 4th.",null,0,null,1437489089,null,0,false,0,ctaw6eq,null,t3_3dzlk9,null,t1_ctaw6eq,null,t1_cta9m7k,null,null,null,1438055454,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Pensions have an administrative burden, particularly those accepting regular contributions. The idea that you can get trackers at &lt;0.25% is nice, but it only tells half the story.

The cheapest sub-£40,000 or so pensions available on the direct-to-consumer market are with the likes of BestInvest (0.30% administration fee). You can build a portfolio of diversified trackers for about 0.2% PA, or 0.24% PA if you outsource that aspect to Vanguard with their LifeStrategy funds. Total cost ~0.54% PA.

Once your funds are over £40,000 or so you can get the cost down by going with a fixed-fee SIPP. Even then, you would need funds in excess of ~ £150,000 to bring the costs down to the 0.25% level. Fixed-fee platforms also tend to charge buy fees (which can make them expensive if you're making regular contributions).

Likewise, being an MP for a political party is a franchise, and the party gets to kick you out if you don't put the right toppings in the burgers and break hygiene rules (i.e. if you're not Tory™ or Labour™ enough).

Thus the whip is the party telling MP's ""this is how you have to vote, otherwise you'll lose the franchise"" in which case someone else will stand for MP in your area next time.

There are nuances to this - independent MPs stand little chance of success because most people want to change the government, not the local guy. And, in first past the post and the two party system, there's no backsies if your vote is wasted on the wrong guy. So your candidacy pretty much *has* to be backed by a major party if you're to stand a chance of being an MP. 

Meanwhile, safe seats are only given to party faithful, anyway, and backbenchers know their seat is at risk at the next election. Thus backbenchers are more likely to rebel against the party whip and vote out of conscience - because they have less to lose.

I post this regularly, but I think more people need to understand the reality we live in, a reality where people are not free actors. 


&gt;politics and economics both assume that the players are rational, at least in the sense of knowing their own short-term self-interest. As rational actors, reality provides them with limited choices. It is assumed that, on the whole, people and nations will pursue their self-interest, if not flawlessly, then at least not randomly. Think of a chess game. On the surface, it appears that each player has twenty potential opening moves. In fact, there are many fewer because most of these moves are so bad that they quickly lead to defeat. The better you are at chess, the more clearly you see your options, and the fewer moves there actually are available.

Sterling said some shitty things both through himself and his agent, said they didn't protect him from the media.

Anyway the vast majority of the aid goes towards protecting the extremely corrupt, who in turn provide generous contracts for British industry. Especially defence, but also finance these days.

Most people don't realise that financial aid provides far more money coming in (even if it's corrupt, blood soaked money) than going out.

The problem with this country is it still wants the foreign blood money but it doesn't want to pay the bribes. Which doesn't make any sense. 

Most of the right wing who despise seeing money going to certain type of people don't realise that the money goes towards making the undesirable foreigners far worse in order for Britain to get more money, if they were the real socio-paths they'd see that foreign aid is good for the country. 

I'm pretty sure they are, they're just misinformed about the reality of the situation. They've also bought into all the propaganda about Britain actually being one of the good guys.

I don't know what point you are trying to make.. are you suggesting that we should be happy to suffer the stupidity of politicians, just because they are well intentioned and not perfect.. should we be happy with our lot and not complain.. and worse vote Conservative? Should we not want for better? Should we just be the happy consumer that those with all the power and wealth, and worse the corporations, want?

For all your replies, what you've not acknowledged is the real enemy is power and wealth beyond politics.. the corporations are too big to fight and Government should be protecting us, not indulging them.. the trade deals are suspect for the way they've been contrived... but then you would have us roll over and accept the fate.. just because politicians aren't perfect.

The other aspect of noting that politicians are mostly well intentioned ""well rounded decent people"", is that that tempts a lazy attitude all round. We should not accept the difference; we should push for better.

The best calculator I've found is https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/pension-calculator

Playing around with your rough numbers - you'd need to start saving around £19k per year if you wanted to retire at 65 with £24k.

Assuming you put all £86k into a pension now...

&gt;  At your preferred retirement age of 65 your total pension pot size could be £135,549. 

&gt;If you take a tax free lump sum of 25% of your total pension pot it will give you a cash payment of £33,887.

&gt; This will leave a remainder of £101,662 in your pension pot which could provide you an income of: £5,021 per year. This income would stay the same throughout retirement but would buy less over time if prices rise. 

If you stuck £40k in there now, and contributed around £10k per year into a pension scheme until you retire, that'd get you £20k per year to live on.

Have a good think about what your plans are for retirement.  Do you want to sail the world in a luxury yacht or just go fishing down the canal ever weekend?

Leeds is a very ""Studenty"" University from what i've seen from it and know of it, big nightlife and big student culture, for instance. When I was in Sixth Form (in Manchester), huge numbers of people applied for it even if they had no chance in hell in getting there. Part of this is that it's pretty close to manchester, but it's massively popular these days for it's atmosphere.

One thing I would say about leagues is that it's entry requirements are a bit inflated due to it's popularity - don't get me wrong it's still a great university, but if you haven't been accepted or applied for it yet I would bear it in mind.

Bristol is another fantastic cultural city, and a great university. Not all of it is nice, but I prefer it to Leeds personally, and if you're desperate to go to London often it's much more hand. Also, a lot of buildings are covered in street art which lends the place a bit of a charm and I personally quite like.

I wouldn't worry about any university in the UK not being lively though. I go to a campus university which is outside a relatively small city and is probably a quite quiet university in the grand scheme of things, but if you want to go out to a club, drink a lot and do some bizzare extracurricular activities you absolutely can, and Bristol and Leeds are bound to be much more lively than where I study.",null,0,null,1437490314,null,0,false,0,ctawwvv,null,t3_3e0zgm,null,t1_ctawwvv,null,t3_3e0zgm,null,null,null,1438055966,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Dier was a great signing and will really come into fruition within a few years. 

Davies provided much needed depth for the LB role, he is a very necessary player.

With Freidel resigning, and Lloris recently getting an injury. it's quite obvious why we signed Vorm.

Yedlin &amp; Dele Ali are your classic Spurs low risk signings, even if they don't work out we'll sell them at profit.

Fazio was always a poor signing, I don't know why people were excited about a slow centre-back with attitude problems, but when I pointed this out I got downvoted. He was gambled to be just as good as Musacchio, he wasn't.

Stambouli just didn't make sense at all.

&gt;GDP balance and global wealth has shifted away from developed economies towards developing economies

This just reinforces why you cannot comment purely on GDP growth. Developing countries are starting at such a low baseline that it's very easy for them to make large proportional increases based on minimal investment, particularly with debt so cheap at the moment due to low interest rates. This is absolutely not sustainable as interest rates rise and they carry out all of the cheap infrastructure upgrades. For example, China is slowing almost monthly as they try to transition from developing to developed. It doesn't last.

*Public Sector Borrowing (or Deficit)*

*****

In June 2015, the public sector spent more money than it received in taxes and other income. This meant it had to borrow £9.4 billion to balance the books, which was broadly in line with market expectation2.

Of this £9.4 billion, £7.6 billion related to the cost of the ""day-to-day"" activities of the public sector (the current budget deficit), while £1.8 billion related to the spending on infrastructure (net investment).

Annual borrowing has generally been falling since the peak in the financial year ending March 2010. So far this financial year, the public sector has borrowed £25.1 billion. This is £6.1 billion lower than at the same point in the previous financial year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, who produces economic and fiscal forecasts for government, expects that the public sector will borrow £69.5 billion during the financial year ending March 2016.

*Income and Spending by Central Government*

*****

Central government’s income and spending make the largest contribution to the amount borrowed by the public sector. Central government received £46.9 billion in income in June 2015. This is around 4% higher than in the same month last year, largely due to receiving higher amounts of VAT, national insurance contributions and income tax this year, compared to last.

Central government spent £58.1 billion, in June 2015, again around a 4% increase compared to the previous year. Of this amount, roughly half was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence) and around a quarter on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, child benefit and maternity pay).

*Debt*

*****

The amount of money owed by the government to the private sector stood at £1.5 trillion at the end of June 2015, which equates to 81.5% of value of all the goods and services currently produced by the UK economy in a year (or gross domestic product). 
Debt has been built up by successive government administrations over many years. When the government borrows, this adds to the debt total. 
Public sector debt increased rapidly following the banking crisis in the financial year ending March 2008

Tougher skin?  Disliking a player that disrespected the club has nothing to do with the toughness of one's skin.

&gt; I've been through the best players in football, basketball, and soccer leaving my favourite team but it seems soccer is a lot more sentimental than other sports.

No shit.  European football is structured differently.  It's quite obvious that the sentiment towards the players will be different.  Clubs are engrained in the community in a way that you just don't see in American sports.  

&gt; I've been huge fans of Derrick Jeter and Paul Pierce both legends at their clubs for 15+ years.

Neither of those are remotely similar to Sterling.  They would be more comparable to Gerrard... but then again Derek Jeter and Paul Pierce weren't born and raised in the city they played.  American sports don't really compare.  It is a different culture.

&gt; Even with players like sterling most fans don't have a single kinda word to say about Sterling.

And why should they?  In his 2 and a half years playing what did he ever win for us?  Nothing.  He was a gifted young player with lots of potential that treated the club like dirt because he thought he was worth more.  And he could hardly finish.

&gt; Many many players leave in bad ways, but in much worse ways. 

Many, many murders are worse than murder x, but it does not make murder x not terrible.  Stupid logic.

&gt; terling said some shitty things both through himself and his agent, said they didn't protect him from the media. Which is a stupid thing to say but people just want to say he's a shitty human being and fuck his family. He was a pretty damn good player for us yet so many Liverpool fans seem to be on a high horse about Sterling. ""How dare you?"" Type of attitude.

He wasn't *that* good, and he definitely did not earn the respect that warrants being considered a legend or anything like that.

&gt; He left our club in a bad way, but didn't fuck the owners mother. I appreciate what he did for the club in his short time here. My point is that what sterling did isn't that bad

The thing is, if people go to university they're supposed to learn skills valuable in the job market. With those skills, they can have a higher earning potential when they graduate, which means they should be paying more in taxes, as well as supporting skilled industries which themselves will generate tax revenue and possibly trade income. If university tuition is seen as an economic investment (as it is in plenty of countries, [plenty of whom have a higher GDP per capita than we do despite free tuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_(nominal)) then it absolutely makes sense not to charge people for it up front via a loans system. 

The real issue is that the approach to integrating young workers into the economy has been haphazard and incoherent. Apprenticeship schemes do not have enough numbers or quality, university courses are offered that have little value in the job market and good quality white collar jobs are hard to find for non-graduates, in part because the jobs aren't there, in part because secondary education isn't up to standard. Charging increasingly high fees for university treats a symptom of this problem but not the problem itself and I really don't think it's the best way to fund higher education. 

&gt;If you can't grasp that your 'loan' is almost free money already, I don't think university is for you..

I don't think you're in a position to be making remarks like this if you think loaned money equates to free money. It essentially adds an extra tax band of 9% on top of all earnings above £17k for me (£21k for people on the new system). It's not crippling, but it's noticeable. It also grows over time due to interest (currently at 1.5% + inflation for the old system, 3% + inflation for the new. Compared to a bank loan its cheap money, but compound interest is a powerful thing), so its entirely possible that even on a respectable salary you'll have the equivalent of a very nice holiday taken out of your paycheck every year for the rest of your working life (average salary in the UK is about £26k I think, you'd expect the average graduate to be on more than that. You can play with the numbers using [SalaryBot](https://salarybot.co.uk/)). Loan money is not free money.

They may have a flat screen TV but unless we are willing to let children die on the street then we are getting a bloody good deal.

Cost of State Care source - figures may not be exact but the margin is so huge it hardly matters.

The fact of the matter is that there are a lot of things people would rather keep private in many ways, shapes and forms and for many reasons, i.e because of the fear of embarrassment, any professional, social, legal, or monetary ramifications that could result from this information being leaked out. And some of the things that the Snoopers' Charter are proposing to store uncencrypted such as IM conversations, voice communications, browsing histories, search histories, billing details, activity in online video games, possibly a log of files that have been downloaded, and the history of products they've bought, their real world identities, and others are the sort of things that people are worried about the government scooping up.

Then there's the broad-wording of clauses within the Draft Communications Data Bill, which has the Open Rights Group, amongst other critics, deeply concerned about how much data really can be stored on people.

David Cameron's comments on encryption and how it should either be illegalised or weakened are also very, very worrying for the future of the internet because sufficiently powerful one-way hashing and two-way encryption algorithms are necessary to keep everybody's information secure and difficult, if not near-impossible to breach.

So let's say David Cameron builds a surveillance network under the provisions of the Draft Communications Data Bill and now we have everybody's internet activity and personal information being stored and actively monitored. This leaves many possible dangerous scenarios which may occur, such as government and ISP databases being targeted by hackers, who then have the ability to steal or leak a treasure trove of personal and payment details on people, or the government deciding to later secretly sell personal information to third-party companies willing to pay up for said information, or even a dystopian 1984-style police state where disi.

The second scenario (the selling of personal information to third parties) is especially is something that the Tories could do to line their coffers, as I imagine there is a lot of corporate interest from insurance firms, credit card companies, record and film industry associations, and many others.

The third scenario is less likely but remember that societal attitudes, economic climates and political power can change very quickly.

Yes it is. 

Let's take a step back and think about what they are doing. 

They are discriminating against people, based on their gender identity. Do we want to think about that for a bit? Some transgender people have taken it upon themselves to discriminate based on the same thing that they themselves face discrimination for. That's quite literally the daily-mash level stuff, and so it does, to me, read as parody. 

&gt;  It's a sensitive subject

No one has said otherwise that I can see, I certainly haven't. 

&gt;  being tackled by people who're much more empathetic towards those struggling with sexual identity than you are. 

Um, do you want to give any evidence for such a baseless claim? 

&gt;  You don't approve... 

No, I do not. 

&gt; ... or understand ... 

That's another baseless assertion. You have no idea of my level of knowledge. 

&gt; ... and why would I or they expect you to.


Because if they want to move society on at all, they have to take society with them. Not exclude people, build up their own barriers, and bitch about the rest of us not playing ball. This is exactly how to create resentment both within the LGBT community and between the LGBT community and the rest of the world. 

They have absolutely no need to explain themselves to anyone, but neither do they or you have any grounds to whinge that we're not in approval. 

This whole thing is an absolute nonsense, they're bringing lots of negative press onto a community I'm heavily involved with, they're furthering discrimination on the basis of gender identity, they're further building on entrenched binary gender identities, they're creating resentment between drag performers and trans people, and they're going to result in more trans people getting bad treatment - I've already seen some examples of this. They're a fucking embarrassment, and the quicker they grow up, the better.

You refuted your own point.

We could have asked him not to throw a tantrum, call in sick to training, and force a move... without showing enough character to hand in a transfer request.

Magic in his feet. 

Holds true for Hazard today and sure did for **Joe Cole** during his 6 years with Chelsea, which were unfortunately troubled by injuries and led to his departure to Liverpool (replaced by one of the most forgetable name this century : Yossi Benayoun), the team he loved to score against. 

The headliner this week is his goal in the title-clinching game against ManU in 2006, [even with the replay](http://i.imgur.com/vybmHtD.gifv) I'm still mesmerized by how he managed to pull that of. 

Here's the set :

Yes.  The losers, who should have done a better job getting the vote out and arguing their case before the election.

null,false,GeorgeMellor,null,null,null,"&gt; means testing benefits is not racing to the bottom. I'm as progressive as they come, but we have no business using tax money to help the rich

It most certainly is.

The point about universal public services is that they're *universal* - this a crucial point. We do not say to people who earn over X amount per year ""you're not allowed to use public services, send your kids to a private school, use a private hospital etc"" because we implicitly recognise all people rich and poor have a right to a basic amount of social security. 

It also leads to viewing other forms of public service, the NHS, public schools, council houses, as a form of charity from the rich to the poor. Welfare is based on social solidarity, not charity, and we do not create these sorts of institutions for them to be used simply to throw a few crumbs off the table to help the poor, but to become a social floor beneath which no-one can fall. 

It's the same principle with the much-loved policy of ""taking people out of tax"" by cutting taxes for low earners, whilst simultaneously praising the ""hardworking aspirational taxpayer"" as some sort of God-like figure we all must look up to. This sets it up so down the line, low earners, people in part-time work who don't pay tax and rely on tax credits and welfare to keep going, can have their social safety net taken away. ""Why should you, who doesn't even pay in to the tax system, be allowed to send your kids to a state school?"" 

This is already starting with immigrants, who won't be able to claim benefits or use public services unless they pay into the tax system for X number of years, and because most people are comfortable with sticking it to immigrants they'll not stop to think that that logic will be used against them. 

Having successfuly demonised the unemployed and disabled as being too lazy and feckless to work, we'll now move on to other forms of social division to undermine the universal social solidarity welfare was built on - part-time versus full-time, old versus young, taxpayer versus non-taxpayer, and so on, all cheered on by the short-sighted, supposedly progressive nice people such as yourself.

You could, at a push, make a case for letting the very wealthy opt out of their state pension in return for a tax break of some kind, if they're a high-tax brakcet earner, but I'd make sure the principle of universal benefits is kept cos once that goes the whole thing goes.",null,0,null,1437494512,null,0,1437498646,0,ctazmpj,null,t3_3dzlk9,null,t1_ctazmpj,null,t1_ctayypo,null,null,null,1438058081,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Blubbey,null,null,null,"**14/15:**

Dier - main backup on the right and became the default with Jan by the end of the year and is only 21. Definite improvement.

Davies - generally solid, just so happened to have Rose jump a couple of levels. Compared to before? Definite upgrade as a backup (Naughton/Jan/Fryers) and almost certainly has improved Rose. Improvement.

Vorm - Friedel has retired, definite upgrade on someone who doesn't play any more. Generally quite good, although I'd take a 30 y/o Friedel over him.

Fazio - compared to Vlad/Kaboul? Yes an upgrade for third choice. Over Daws? Questionable, slight improvement. *Adding on to this he's potentially gone from third to 5th choice now, which is an upgrade. Not bad at all.

Yedlin - too little to go on. In a very difficult position being 22 and being behind a 24 (soon to be 25) and 25 y/o with Kyle Walker-Peters who's 18 who will soon be snapping at his heels.

Alli - too little to go on. If I were to go out on a limb, I'd say he's an upgrade compared to Paul/Stam/Cap and only being 19, he has many years ahead of him.

Stam - sold.

**15/16:**

Wimmer - potentially yes, according to Cologne supports on /r/soccer he had a very good year and was key to their defensive successes.

Trippier  - had a good/very good year last year in a side that was relegated. If Walker plays like last year a definite upgrade, if they push each other to improve a definite upgrade, if Walker improves a lot and makes Tripp the backup that's still an upgrade.

&gt;On what arguments do you base your prediction that next economic crisis is coming in less than a year?

&gt;Everything that appears to be going well is doing so on the basis of such a massive injection of liquidity without providing any real growth. This is the biggest stimulus package which has ever existed. It was not used as a Keynesian stimulus package, but for buying up toxic debt, and it has even not been able to get 0.5% growth.

&gt;Now there is an even bigger debt bubble than in 2007–8, and the banks are even more concentrated than before the crash. If you look at the US stock market, you will see that firms are borrowing money in order to buy their own shares to maintain the prices, and not investing in the real economy. Unemployment is increasing, at least in terms of real jobs rather than pseudo-jobs. The European economy is not really recovering, and there are also difficulties in China.

&gt;These three areas amount to 60 percent or more of the world economy — and if each of them is fragile, it is plausible to conclude that we will have a new crisis.

Putting him into the midfield gave us a drive that we apparently lacked without him. He is an excellent player that at 20, promises a lot for the future.

That is literally the definition of democracy, 'a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state', everyone should have a voice in democracy. You can't have a democracy where people don't have a voice, that's not a democracy.

I think you're confused between direct democracy and representative democracy. This isn't what I'm arguing. Personally, I do believe that we should have direct democracy, but I understand that the system we have now is a representative one. However, a representative democracy should aim to be as representative as possible; it should reflect, to the best of its ability, the wishes of the population in whom they wish to govern them.

A coalition is more representative of the electorate's wishes than a single majority. 59% of people voted for either a Conservative government or a Lib Dem government. That's a majority of the population. Now, obviously there were issues with the coalition; Lib Dem voters were angry because they didn't vote for the Conservatives, yet it was their vote that allowed for them to go into government, yet this is an issue with our current system.

 - Ings is much better than Origi currently and much more likely to feature more.

 - Balotelli is transfer listed and didn't even play when we had a striker crisis last season, let alone now when we'll have better/more options. 

 - It's Firmino, not Firminho, I really don't get how people spelling it that way has started.

It looks like we'll be playing a 4-3-3 and diamond depending on opposition and who's available or in form.

My ideal 4-3-3;

                              Migs

        Clyne          Skrtel       Sakho      Moreno

                             Lucas

                 Henderson           Milner

       Firmino                                 Coutinho

                            Benteke

My ideal diamond;


                              Migs

        Clyne          Skrtel       Sakho      Moreno

                             Lucas

                 Henderson           Milner

                       Coutinho/Firmino

             Ings/Firmino            Benteke

Firmino being able to play either role in the diamond is fine with me.

It was Year 7 school camp, we were camping in a public country park for a week.  I was sharing a tent with a kid in my class and being that it was a public park we were both a little bit scared that anyone could come along and get in our tents.

The school secretary was going round all the tents and making sure that everyone was ok.  My mate and I told her that we were both a bit scared/uneasy.

She said she would pray with us and said a basic prayer to the effect of ""help us sleep and keep us safe"".  She then left and a short while later I looked at my friend and said ""are you feeling what I'm feeling"", he said ""yeah"".  I was feeling the most intense sense of peace and calm that I have ever experienced and didn't feel it was necessary to tell him what I was feeling, I just assumed that he was feeling it too.

I've not felt anything like that before or since.  I grew up where it was normal for my mum to pray with me everytime I sick and there were never any miracle cures, but this experience was definitely out of the ordinary.

&gt;What do you think of our dealings so far?

Excellent. We've been getting rid of our dead weight for decent amounts of money in addition to the fact we've made 3 *very* smart buys. Our biggest weakness in our team last year was the defence and so far our incoming transfers have all been defenders that will undoubtedly improve our shaky defence.


&gt; What positions still need to be looked at?

I think we are still in desperate need of an out-n-out winger, someone who will just bomb it down the wing, down to the byline and then cross it. I think we also need another quality, proven goalscorer in the striker position. Not saying a world-class striker but someone like Berahino or Austin would suffice. Last of all I think we are in dire need of- to put it in football manager terms- a ball-winning midfielder in CM position, someone who will complement the type of midfielder Bentaleb is.

&gt;Do you have any realistic suggestions for those positions?

Striker: Berahino, Winger: Yarmolenko, BWM: honestly stumped on this one. Perhaps Gonalons, but why would he leave a CL team?

&gt; Should we look to sell anyone else?

Yes, lets keep up the good-form of selling our dead wood. Would like to see Chiriches, Lennon, Carroll, Adebayor, Soldado (if the offer is too good to turn down) and Vorm (we have Archer &amp; Miles) all go.


**Players**
&gt; What do you think our best XI is currently?

Lloris; Trippier, Vert, Alderweireld, Rose; Bentaleb, Dembele; Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli; Kane

&gt;Who do you think will improve on their last season?

I think we all know who... To Dier is To Do. Dier is going to just keep on improving, he's got so many qualities (including being hella fast) and I think he will take over Vert's position eventually. Bentaleb will also undoubtedly progress as a player this season and I think he'll be turning in even more amazing performances. To me, Lamela was fucking shite last season, but I'm pretty confident that he'll improve this season.

&gt; Do you think anyone will regress?

Fazio and Lennon. Also, I don't think Kane is going to score 30+ goals again this season but defo think he'll hit the 20s.

Multiple sources report that Lazio are in for Sakho, and that his agent is in Rome today for talks. Reports conflict on the reason for Sakho's potential exit, with some stating that he's fallen out with BR/LFC and wants to secure regular football to ensure place in the France squad in the Euros, and others stating that the club is desperate to keep him.

[Reds to Offer Sakho to Lazio](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-transfer-rumours-reds-9696587)

When he has not been injured Sakho has been a consistent performer and was one of our best during our 13 game unbeaten run last season. I for one would be sad to see him go.

She speaks with the prime minister every week and has done for many many years. She has travelled the world. She has met incredible people. I have a respect and admiration for the amount of knowledge she must hold in her head!

She does make many decisions for herself. I believe she made the decision to try to mend relations with Ireland. She has shaken hands with people we thought she never would. She has visited places in Ireland we never thought she would. It is extremely important that she has done this and she really didn't have to.

After victory was declared in the war she went out and partied in London like a normal person!

She was a good sport and appeared in a short Bond clip for the Olympics.

While there is a big difference between Zionist and Jewish, it's also undeniably true that support for Israel is very high and passionately held by a large part of the British Jewish community. To take (what some would regard as) an ""anti-Israel"" position would certainly contribute to the disillusionment with Labour among Jewish voters.

null,false,lostsoulfreespirit,null,null,null,"For me it will always be Suarez. As soon as we were selling him it was no way but down, you can't replace a talent like that. Nevermind physically what he brings to the pitch but the mentality and the hunger and the infectious way he integrates it into the whole squad. It fires up the supporters as well. 

I did see Gerrard play against San Jose the other day and though I did enjoy it, it also made me feel unbelievably sick to my stomach at the same time. But over the last few years I've been leaning more towards trying to play without Stevie because his legs have been shot and it felt kind of eventual to be honest. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would hurt....I say this but watching him with a galaxy jersey on just didn't feel right, but seeing him struggle playing in the premier league and having Hendo do his running for him didn't feel right either...neither would have seeing him on the bench match after match. So I'm pretty happy now I'll get to see him play regular football in a league which is a fair bit below his level even now, but where he'll be able to have more of an influence, pass on his knowledge. Help the sport grow. He'll always be with us though. 

The thing about Suarez for me that hurt so much though, is that you knew after that season he was just going to get better and better. The explosiveness, the fire, the temperament, the controversy. I miss it all, and I miss the way a player like wee Luis made our captain smile and dream one more time before his on the pitch career ended with our beloved club. I miss the competativeness which with him and Sturridge ended up scoring a combined total of 50+ goals between just them two. I miss the way someone like him would run to Flanagan after that goal against Spurs! He made us believe once more and he healed a heartbroken Steven Gerrard after Nando chose to leave. 

And I couldn't begrudge a player like that a move to Barcelona to essentially be settled down where his wife's family are as well. At the same time, everytime I see him in a shirt other than red it makes me sick. Someone that good, to have someone of that caliber, who plays at that level, consistently week after week. It makes me sad he isn't still in our red.

&gt;Given the fact that the coalition essentially stopped imposing new austerity measures after its first two years, there’s nothing at all surprising about seeing a revival of economic growth in 2013.

null,false,dednbreak,null,null,null,"Looks like we have found ourselves in an environment where rest of the top 4 have squads deeming with first team players that could literally walk into any team in the world whilst we lack anyone of that nature in our entire squad. Even Sturridge will not be able to walk into most top teams in the world and he is our best player.   
   
Let's take a look at our competition,

#Arsenal#   
   
They have had their core for a few seasons now. They have stopped selling their best players to rivals. If you check out their starting eleven, most of the players have been in the team for at least for three years now. Their entire core has been retained well. Almost all of their players and even bench players are well above average. They're a better team than most of the other squads that will be fighting for the title.
    
Definite Top 4? **Yes**    
    
    
# Manchester City#    

Do they have the squad to challenge for the title? A resounding yes. Would they finish in top 4 even with a poor season? Yes. Their squad is filled with talent and players who are just pure world class. The likes of Aguero, Silva, Toure, Fernandinho. Sterling is going to give their team even more depth. I hated this transfer and the saga that went along with it. If Sterling was sold to real madrid or someone else it won't bite us but this transfer has a very good reason to bite us in the future if not this season, may be next or the one after. City's defense was shaky last season and it was down to the fact Kompany was out of form. Their second choice striker Jovetic has as many goals as our main striker Sturridge in all competitions and they have both managed only the same amount of games 17 in all competition. If City could manage to keep Aguero, Silva and Toure fit they will be in top 4 with no real sweat.    
    
Top 4: **Yes**        
    
#Chelsea    

Most likely to win the title. Best squad in the league, best manager in the league. It would take a miracle for any team to distort their claim to be champions. Mourinho is strategically sound and a better tactician than almost every other manager in the league. It would be hard to argue against the fact that they will be champions or in the least they will be competing for the title.   
    
Top 4: **Yes** Title: **Most likely**     
    

# Manchester United#

Probably the only team out of the top four apart from City that will be our rivals. But United have strengthened. Compared to the other top 4 teams, they currently have the most strengthened squad compared to the previous season. They had a dodgy start to the season last year but came out of it with no real trouble.They have over spent on transfer and have signed top quality players in Schweinsteiger, Depay and have allegedly lodged 100 million bid for Muller. If they do not sell Di Maria and if he manages to find form there is nothing stopping them from even contending for title.    
    
# Liverpool FC#
    
The team that is in the outlier. We have a better chance of winning the Europa league than finishing in top four if the rest of the contenders have everything going their way. There is a chance to dislodge one team from the top four. The squad is quite improved compared to last season. Gerrard left and if he had left four seasons ago Liverpool would have been in bad shape but it barely made a difference. Benteke would be the one who will make or break Liverpool's season. Even a fifteen goal return would be considered a good return. With Firmino added to the squad and the purchase of a decent RB in Clyne and Wisdom coming back Liverpool is a bit more solid on the right flank.

null,false,justthisplease,null,null,null,"&gt;Caroline Lucas, the Green Party’s MP for Brighton Pavilion will today vote against the ‪#‎FinanceBill‬, which she has labelled as ‘deeply regressive’.

&gt;“I will be voting against the deeply regressive Finance Bill today because it continues the Government’s cruel and counterproductive austerity agenda, which is both socially destructive and economically illiterate.

&gt;“Despite the Government’s rhetoric the IFS analysis makes it perfectly clear that the biggest losers from this bill are those in the second and third poorest tenths of the population. It’s simply untrue for ministers to say that that this year’s budget is progressive.”
Lucas also slammed the Government for favouring the ‘profits of polluters’ over ‘people’s right to live in a safe and habitable climate’:

&gt;“The detail of the Finance Bill also flies in the face of the Government’s own rhetoric about the threat of climate change to our economy, society, security and wellbeing. It proposes, for example, to tax renewable energy as if it were a fossil fuel – by removing the climate change levy exemption for renewables.

&gt;“This comes alongside the announcement in the Budget to scrap the long-established zero carbon homes policy-meaning that future homes, offices, schools and factories will be more costly to run, locking residents and building users into higher energy bills.

&gt;“It’s fossil fuel subsides that should be cut – not support for clean, green, home-grown renewable energy or targets for warmer homes. It’s deeply disappointing to see this Government continue to prioritise the profits of polluters over people’s right to live in a safe and habitable climate.”",null,0,null,1437499117,null,0,false,0,ctb2slu,null,t3_3e2gjm,null,t1_ctb2slu,null,t3_3e2gjm,null,null,null,1438060582,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"It's not really outlandish at all. Why do you think nuclear energy is such a popular solution at the moment? It certainly is not because of the price - it's significantly more expensive than fossil fuels in most countries and in countries like Germany, it's in a similar price range to solar PVs. The real reason why nuclear energy is so popular is a) because it's very convenient as it requires no change in the energy infrastructure and more importantly b) because it's intrinsically centralised, meaning energy corporations retain their monopoly on energy production. A shift to nuclear energy would suck for the fossil fuels industry but it's absolutely fine for the utility firms. 

In comparison, renewable energy (in particular solar PV and to some extent wind energy) is fundamentally decentralised. It makes it possible for communities to own their own sources of energy. It represents a shift of power away from the energy corporations and to the people. Critically, this means that all of the proceeds from the energy generation goes directly into the local communities, rather than significant chunks of money being taken away as dividends by utility firms. This is the reason why solar energy has been so incredibly successful in countries like Germany, and also why the cost of solar PV has become so low in Germany - because local communities are pooling money together to construct solar farms and they are reaping 100% of the profits from them. This is why renewable energy is such an appealing form of energy to socialists over nuclear energy. Sure, you could put an argument forward for state ownership but I'm fairly certain that you'd still find that most members of the Green Party would rather own the means of energy production themselves than to allow the State to own it. And of course, there are other more minor (but not insignificant) arguments against nuclear energy such as the fact that it blocks nuclear disarmament and makes nuclear terrorism possible.

I think it's important to mention that most Green Party supporters would support nuclear energy over the status quo, but that arguing in favour of nuclear energy when renewables are a much better alternative is pointless and defeats the object of the Green Party's socialist aims.

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"The Queen is actually pretty busy in the background working on our behalf and on behalf of a lot of people around the world. She keeps up to date on political matters, mainly from the UK but she does get general briefing on the goings-on of all the countries she is head of state for, and will get specific details if she is interested in a particular topic. The Queen has her own Government red box (A ministerial briefcase, the tradition of which dates back to Prince Albert in the 1860s) and is known in Government circles as Reader Number 1. She gets copies of all of the important documents even if they don't require royal assent just because she is interested in keeping up with the goings on of her government.

This naturally means that when she speaks to the Prime Minister in a weekly Audience, or with the Scottish First Minister when she's in Balmoral, or when she meets other ministers (for example the Chancellor on Budget day) she asks questions, gets clarification, and whilst not officially expressing an opinion the fact that she asks questions and makes the ministers think about things means they have to be sure about what they are saying.

Apart from that, the Queen hosts events for all sorts of people - she holds yearly garden parties for people who have served their communities with distinction, she meets her Govenors General on a regular basis (the Govenors General act as the Queen's representatives in countries where she is head of state), new diplomats posted to the UK formally present their credentials to her regularly, she hosts dinners and parties for groups, ranging from the England football team to Americans living in the UK, as well as formal Banquets for visiting dignitaries (like Obama, Chiraq, Pratibha Patil (a former President of India) etc etc).

Besides that, she makes lots of visits to various places inside the UK - things like openings of important buildings, visiting wounded servicemen, and just generally being seen. There are also tours of foreign countries - for example the Queen visited Germany in June of this year, and visited the USA in 2007.

When she makes speeches, most of the time (with the notable exception of the Queen's Speech on the opening of parliament) she has a lot of input into them and will usually decide the theme and main points and will approve the final draft (possibly followed by the Foreign Office if a foreign power is involved).

There are also state occasions in the Queen's calendar, like the State Opening of Parliament, Trooping the Colour and the Garter Ceremony, and the Queen is also head of many charities which she gives up some time for.

The Queen is also responsible for the administration of the Royal finances and the palaces and other buildings. She is also in overall control of the Royal transport, which consists of one helicopter and the Royal Train, plus occasional use of the jets of the Royal Flight of the RAF (when they aren't busy being used as navigational trainers) or the hiring of British Airways aircraft (or parts thereof) for longer overseas visits.

And on top of all that she is a mother, a grandmother and a great grandmother, and has to work in running a large family.

The Queen, in her limited downtime, is also very fond of horses and horse racing, and takes a keen interest in her stud farms - it's said she knows the names of all of her horses by heart, and their lineage up to Grandmother level. She attends Ascot yearly (both as a state occasion and for fun) and often goes to watch her husband in his carriage driving events.",null,0,null,1437499365,null,0,false,0,ctb2ywj,null,t3_3e0x2b,null,t1_ctb2ywj,null,t3_3e0x2b,null,null,null,1438060881,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

The damper could help with strength against high wind, but I believe in design and city review that contribution is neglected. This is mainly because of the problem you noted about power tending to go out in storms just when you need it. 

The main reason Citicorp was at risk was due to installed brace connections that weren't as strong as the original design called for.

When something has (at this moment) 31 upvotes and an 84% upvote rate, then maybe it's actually posted in the right place? And if it's not, wouldn't the downvote button serve its purpose?

And if it's generally agreed upon that a post could/should go in /r/coyscirclejerk, then isn't there a more tactful way to approach this?

Credit to her, though. She's a good mum, and she's got a job recently (although minimum wage) so she's not doing so bad. 

Still, the attitude of 'now the government have to look after me!' must end.

CDU/CSU: 37.2 + 8.1
SPD: 29.4
Left: 8.2
Green: 7.3

Other parties failed to gather the 5% needed to enter parliament. This led to the following seat distribution:

CDU/CSU: 40.5 + 8.9
SPD: 30.5
Left: 10.2
Green: 10.0

In parliament there is a slim majority on the left, but as the Left party runs partly a communist platform (anti NATO, and the like), the social democrats refuse to coalition with them.

Instead we got a grand coalition, conservatives and social democrats, that is implementing an agenda* that contains a lot of social democrat elements (like a minimum wage, which we didn't have before). This is worth noting again: the conservatives had a combined 46.3 percent of the vote, a full 16.9 points ahead of the runner up social democrats.

In the UK system, a much smaller share of the popular vote enabled the conservatives to take a majority, and push for rather ideological changes to the structure of the UK state. The voting outcome in terms of popular vote in the UK would not be anywhere near a mandate anywhere with a proportional system.

I have to comment on this lunacy. There is no official word that they have bid E100m for Muller. That's because it's bollocks. He wouldn't leave Bayern anyway. DiMaria is too inconsistent and is leaving for PSG. And Swinestiger (as he will now be known) is injury riddled and not the player he was. What's funny is that the Scum were desperately trying to sign Vidal, got shunned, he chose Bayern so they got rid of their veteran leader and made a good few quid in the process. That's highly amusing to me.

Labour MPs voted to oppose the bill. They raised amendments trying to change the bill. They refused to support (by abstaining) the bill's second reading, but didn't want to vote against it seeing as it had a raft of our own bloody manifesto pledges in there (alongside a bunch of nasty stuff).

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"You can cut the deficit without cutting the budget. Tax revenues in the UK are low, both historically &amp; when compared to many OECD countries. In 2009 for instance tax revenue as a proportion of GDP was 40%, it's current 36%. If you get those revenues up our deficit disappears on its own without cutting anything. 

If you look at where we stand in Europe on this issue we're below the OECD avg, and well below our Northern European counterparts. In Denmark revenue was 49% of GDP in 2013, in France 45%, in Belgium 45%, Finland 44%, Sweden 43%, Italy 43%, Austria 43%, the list goes on. If we have revenues like any of these countries we could support vastly larger levels of public spending than we currently afford. This chancellor wants to reduce public spending because of his ideology of having a low tax low spending state that doesn't look after the least fortunate. Over the next 5 years public spending will go below even American spending. Do we really want to be compared to America? A country with booming inequality brought about by right wing religious fanatics only out for themselves.

Having said that, I'm afraid I disagree with your position.

I guess the first thing I would say is that there's little evidence that banning speech actually works.  It's practically impossible to implement given today's technology.  It doesn't change people's minds to forbid the expression of an opinion and it can actually make things worse, because people will feel that they're being unfairly oppressed.

You cited Canada as an example.  Well, let me cite the US in return.  It has perhaps the least restrictive speech laws of any nation in the world.  Does the US have problems?  Sure.  But it's also been a furnace of innovation for new ideas in science, technology, *and* civil rights.   The struggle is ongoing and it will never end, but the history of the US shows that it has been constantly moving in the direction of more tolerance and more minority rights. And they've managed to do all this without *any* restrictions on hate speech.

And the story is pretty much the same in the UK.  Free speech societies *work*.  They're not perfect, but they move in the right direction.

EDIT:

Huh...surprising that you have no answer. 

- Our wage bill is 6th in the league, our turnover is also 6th in the league so we are right were we need to be 

- More importantly, the reason we can't start doling out 100k a week contract is that other big-name players (Eriksen, Kane, Lloris, Verts, and Bentaleb) would start demanding the same.

- Our budget would be in trouble if we did that, and more importantly:

- Under FFP we are only allowed to increase our wage-bill by 4 million per season (of TV money). That is one single player on a 80k contract.

null,false,princemephtik,null,null,null,"How long are you coming to the UK for under your student visa? Just to briefly explain how your rights work:

* In order for you to get any rights as the partner of an EEA national, she must be here 'exercising treaty rights'. This really means working or studying, though some periods spent jobseeking or ill can sometimes still count. As a student she must have comprehensive private medical insurance. 
* Provided she remains a qualified person, you can stay in the UK on the basis of your relationship with you if you are married, or in a ""durable relationship""
* If she racks up five continuous years as a qualified person, then she gets the right to permanent residence here and can do what she wants
* A durable relationship is usually taken by the Home Office to mean cohabitation for at least two years, it's not as good as marriage because the Home Office *can* use their discretion to refuse it, for example if you have a criminal record, have an adverse immigration history, etc. In practice, whilst they have to have a reason, if they can refuse it they will.
* Your right to stay here is completely parasitic upon her continuing to exercise treaty rights. If, for example, she did not have permanent residence and stopped working, or was studying and didn't have insurance, your right to stay here would immediately end and you could be removed.
* If you try to get married then the Home Office will notified. As another commenter has said the combination of a Pakistani on a student visa and a Polish national will raise suspicion. Do not even try to get married until you can prove your relationship.
* Comply with all the requirements of your student visa, as you can make certain that they will be checking with your university about you if you do get married. If your visa is curtailed and they think you're trying to have a sham marriage then they will detain you.

Make sure you can prove everything. If you cohabit, get a tenancy agreement in both names. Put all bills in joint names, or at least make sure they're spread between you. Make sure there are friends who can attest to you being together. Make sure you don't lose that skype log! 

It's in your interests to move fairly quickly. If Britain does vote to leave the EU then it will still be several years before we do. It's unlikely that couples who were already here will be forced to leave, but who knows. Once you're married, and you both live here for five years, you may be eligible for permanent residence, and to naturalise as British citizens.

Yes, Jeremy's views don't match up with what we're reading out of the results.  Yes, that means that if you reran the election tomorrow with him as leader he would probably lose horrifically.  Yes, that means that he isn't a _guaranteed win_ (I think people saying he's _unelectable_ are jumping to conclusions based on shaky ground).

But the odds are stacked up against us regardless of what we do, and I think that changing tack to a strategy based on conviction, honesty, and the unconventional will at least get people talking about Labour again.  And, in an age where so many are disillusioned from mainline politics, isn't this what we want?

Slavery wasn't abolished by assuming the electorate is always right.  Nor was women's suffrage granted by refusing to challenge the received wisdom.

The grants are not tuition fees, which is a whole other issue, they are about attempting to level the playing field between very low income students and those who can easily afford to live as a student. It's rightly government policy to try and make university education as accessible as possible to all potential students making it a low income benefit like any other, your argument is more suited to tuition fees which pay for the actual education.



The reason this already means tested benefit was turned into a loan is pure politics, the government already decided to ring fence every penny pensioners get which may or may not (definitely) have something to do with chasing their votes. The promised cuts still have to come from elsewhere and it's very easy to take from students or potential students because just a whiff of the word ""student"" and people will be chomping at the bit to talk about how we shouldn't be paying to make other people rich.

I remember reading somewhere that if one of these companies actually fails to deliver and we want to terminate their contracts, we could have to pay them a settlement to end it early - how the hell is this beneficial? A state-run system, run properly, could react better in some cases - not all clearly - to systemic failures. 

I feel this method of introducing the market into welfare programmes and contracting out government services is a massive enabler of cronyism - even if it isn't intentional. How can you have a free market system when only one company is permitted to supply the service based on whomever gets the nod from the government?

Side note: I bought my TV while I was on benefits. Took me 2 years to save up the £180 it cost me. During those 2 years, I had ample opportunity to snatch up a massive smart TV from Bright House, get an Argos card and do it that way, or use one of those Christmas savings things.

While I'm somewhat indebted to the taxpayer for that, I don't really see it that way. After all, I could easily have got a bigger, more awesome TV without putting in any sacrifice. Not because I had too much money, but because there are plenty of options out there for that. How many people who *do* go the Bright House/Argos card route end up not being able to pay off instalments because they hit a precarious position in their benefit income? I already thought of that when I decided I was having none of it. By doing my own saving, I avoided the responsibility of having to budget such a small income to match such a large spend.

However, I recognise myself as an outlier. At a guess, I'd say the majority of people who get this sort of stuff while they're on benefits are saddling themselves with insurmountable debt and/or paying well over the odds primarily because they can't pay upfront. Any jealousy or blaming is entirely misplaced, because nobody with any sense is going to want to be in such a position. However, it doesn't stop there being options, and not necessarily everyone on benefits is so bad at budgeting that the Bright House loan is impossible to handle. I know I couldn't manage such a thing. Perhaps for a matter of weeks and months, I could stably pay off the loan, but you never truly know what's around the corner when you're on benefits. You never know that perhaps next week, the jobcentre will have failed to put your payment through. What do you do at that point, when your £9 weekly instalments for the last 2 weeks are something you can't pay?",null,0,null,1437504139,null,0,1437505245,0,ctb6c0p,null,t3_3e1zti,null,t1_ctb6c0p,null,t1_ctay8qw,null,null,null,1438063517,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Print more money or borrow more money?  If it's ""print more money"", then that is a tax on everyone who has GBP, and inflation harms the poorest the most.  Rich people have assets and can divest -- not so easy for the poor.  Printing more money simply isn't an option.  Not to mention how horribly unfair it is to the responsible people who save for a rainy day, only for their savings to be effectively raided by the state once said rainy day occurs.

If it's ""borrow more money"".  Well firstly, the reason rates are so low is perhaps that we are seen to be doing something positive (cutting) in the eyes of the market.  That means we are seen to be likely to pay it back, so I'm not so sure that borrowing would remain cheap if we decided to start spending massively.  Secondly, all this money must be paid back one day, so the question is ""will these investments create more tax receipts in the long run than they cost?""  Well, I'd be very wary of immediately jumping to ""yes, absolutely"".  The state isn't controlled or guided by market forces, it is guided by politics.  Politics has no place in business.  Our computer industry died for this exact reason due to Tony Benn's politicking, for example.  Once we return to growth, there will be huge interest groups, lobbies and vested interests demanding that the state keeps spending this money.  What I'm saying is that if we are not careful, we will struggle to cut spending when the times are good, and all these ""rainy day investments"" will stay, and suddenly we have an even bigger state.  A state even more inbed with big business.  No thank you. 

Now I don't know how anyone can argue against all cuts at any cost.  Of course we need to cut, surely the question is how quickly?  You see lots of people say ""make cuts and watch gdp and/or gdp growth fall"", as if that in itself is an argument against cuts.  Well, of course if the government suddenly stops spending £X, then GDP will fall, but that is because it takes time for the capital to be reallocated.  It doesn't actually mean we have lost that wealth, and we are now poorer because of it, if we are it is only for a short while.  So long as the cuts are slow enough to allow people, and the economy, to adjust appropriately.

And lastly, when are we meant to cut?  When the times are good, it's ""spend, spend spend"", and now the times are bad it is also ""spend, spend, spend"".  Why can't we cut now?  We have to make cuts because the world economy is still not out of the woods yet.  We could still yet see a return to economic stagnation, and so we should be prepared.

For what it's worth, I'm not necessarily defending the conservatives, but I am defending the idea of cuts and austerity.  There is no such thing as a free lunch; the state cannot just magically provide us with all we need, and in fact will often make things much worse.",null,0,null,1437504822,null,0,1437511784,0,ctb6tkm,null,t3_3e26ze,null,t1_ctb6tkm,null,t1_ctauzp3,null,null,null,1440468753,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

My aunt divorced my uncle due to an abusive relationship, and you would have her stay in it for financial reasons, evidently. She was also not on NMW when she had a child. Nor does she have no qualifications - she has several good O-levels. She just can't take on a job that has a full-time commitment due to health issues and having to look after her son alone - and so that limits her to part-time work, the majority of which is NMW. She is a victim of circumstances and you would see people like her punished for nothing other than having the audacity to have things happen to them unexpectedly.

You have a go at me for simplifying issues but I have never seen anyone gloss over the intricacies of the morality of helping people in need with ""well, that means I'll be negatively affected right now, so it can't be a good thing!""

Like [Agbonlahor's winner at Old Trafford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=44&amp;v=ODMlbaY9Xr8). Nothing special about the goal itself if I'm honest. It was simple. Textbook attacking, really. But what it meant. The result it got us. That was a special day. 

Another of my favourites is from the same season and not really about the goal itself but what it meant. [Milner's penalty against Blackburn in the League Cup semi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaIZbyn1-Wk). Went into that match with a 1-0 lead, an away goal. Looked like we'd have to catastrophically fuck up to not make it to Wembley. Before that penalty though, Blackburn were 2-1 up on aggregate, and had two away goals. We were in trouble. We were going to fall at the final hurdle. The energy in the stadium was draining away quickly, like we'd all started coming to the same conclusion: we're gonna fuck this up. I'll never forget the emotion in Villa Park that night. There was a literal huddle of about six or seven of us in the Witton as he stepped up, all praying that he didn't miss (because we felt like it would kill the game if he did, even though it was still only about 20-25 minutes in). He scored and we blew the roof off. Went on to witness one of the best games I've ever seen, and [invaded the pitch at full time to sing Que Sera Sera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV25mM2JJ9c).

Yeah I know.  I don't blame Labour for the crash, I blame the US government.  The fact is that tax receipts fell massively in the economic downturn, and I blame the labour government for expanding spending such a great deal.  They left us in a bad position when the crash arrived.  

&gt;Think of it this way. If you get sacked tomorrow, should you put your energies into finding a new job or sell all your possessions and cancel your phone and insurance?

Hold on, so is the budget akin to a household budget or not?  Apparently it is when you're pro-spending, but is nothing at all like a household budget as soon as you're pro-austerity.  And anyway, no, if I lost my job I wouldn't sell all my possessions, but I would put off booking my holiday and definitely not eat out as much.  In which case, by your analogy, austerity is justified.  

&gt;Now imagine you've got a nice rich family who will lend you cash for say, going back to uni or keeping your car on the road while you await your first pay check and they will lend you money for below market rates.

What is your point?  There are plenty of reasons not to go on a spending spree, even if we can borrow cheaply.  Assuming of course borrowing stays cheap as soon as the market, I mean ""rich family"" looks at you and sees your deficit balloon even further.

&gt;Oh, and imagine you also had a magic money tree in the back garden, but if you use it too much everyone notices you're minted and ups their prices when they see you coming.

We're essentially pushing debt onto students for something that is unlikely to give them an edge in general employment now. The money is still taken from the government, the money is still given to the University, but rather than wanting it paid back in income tax, which it more than likely will be, we also want the students to pay on top which could have repercussions down the line.

I expect in the next 30 years that the 30 year cap will be removed to make the sale of the loan book more attractive to investors, along with the repayment threshold likely to be frozen at the point of application for the loan.

The problem we face is that if the minimum wage ever hits £10-£11 an hour, which if we get the supposed living wage of 'over £9 an hour' by 2020 will probably mean we're not far off that happening, then minimum wage workers will nearly be at or over the currently frozen repayment threshold under existing terms.

I'm not a huge fan of the whole 'it's free money' approach going on right now. It isn't, and the fact that the government wants to sell it off makes me suspect that since they can retroactively change the terms to any student due to the small print terms, we could all end up being in a bad place.

To pull ideas out of nowhere; I'd be more in favour of having free University education with better options for alternative moves.

I'm a woman and a feminist so I realise I have a lot of bias but surely teaching boys what counts as sexual harassment and threatening behaviour is extremely valuable. I don't think it's right that boys are singled out in the classroom but education is so important because in my experience most men who engage on threatening behaviour don't even realise that they're crossing the line. It goes back to the age old idea of teaching boys not to rape, and avoiding such situations as opposed to teaching girls how not to be raped.

Edit: For all those below saying that it's ridiculous to brand all men as rapists... thats not what I'm doing here or what these classes are doing either. As I say, there is a fine line and, as comes up time and time again, some men inadvertently cross it and become rapists and perpetrators of sexual harassment. Most men do not set out to rape women!! Only a tiny minority of rape and harassment cases are from hardened sexual criminals. If we teach boys and men in university what really constitutes consent, or what is deemed sexually threatening behaviour then that's akin to teaching them not to rape and harass women. You're all right in saying that men are not natural sexual predators but I can guarantee that every single woman will have at some point encountered harassment and the perpetrators don't even realise what  they are doing. As a highly anecdotal example; I was in Bath at the weekend for a friend's hen do. In the club on Saturday this guy started talking at/to me. I was polite and chatted for a while but I wasn't really interested because I was out with my friends ect I made my excuses after 15 mins. As I turned away the guy turned to his friend and started to talk about how I was a ""frigid bitch"" and had ""led him on"". He would walk away thinking that he'd done nothing wrong. Then on the way home with two friends I got asked, with my friends, by a lone man on the street if we had ever fancied a foursome because he had a mega cock he wanted to show us. This is one night! This is not ok behaviour. Both of those men will dismiss this behaviour as ""banter"" or whatever and won't even remember them!

Another glorious byproduct of FFP and of course the homegrown quota is wealthy clubs snatching up young English players before they become too expensive. 

I'm normally not one to get sanctimonious about the practices of clubs like Chelsea and City, but to me shit like the Izzy Brown deal seems fucking reprehensible...it seems like something that damages not only English football clubs but the English national team as well. The kid would be a regular in West Brom's first team by now if he'd just stayed there, and instead he's made one token appearance for Chelsea probably in a meaningless game. He's probably making more money than Bentaleb and Mason too. 

Like I don't mind buying a kid who has already become a first team regular at a young age, but Chelsea swooped in when Brown was still 16. It's just a fucked up trend.

Huh? The abolition of slavery was driven by the electorate - the middle class electorate - hundreds of meetings were held to change things, teh campaign to abolish slavery was a proper movement, and the govt of the day caved (but compensated the cohort of rich slave owners who lost out). The electorate was right, the govt was wrong, the voters forced a change.

Voters at the moment do not want Jeremy Corbyn's ideas of increasing taxes, cuddling up to terrorists, and planned economies. They tried it in the past and it didn't work.

Instead of dissing voters, try listening to them. They've got it right on pretty much everything from slavery to to economic reforms.

P.S. The other thing you need to know about the abolition of slavery was it was a Tory movement and a Tory achievement. The anti-slavery movement was made up mainly by Tories. The liberals were not interested because it got in the way of money-making. It's cartoonish to assume that these people are wrong about everything.

P.P.S. The abolition of the death penalty also came about because of public pressure. The last person to be hung, Ruth Ellis, was an abused woman (she miscarried due to a punch in the stomach) and there was outrage that she should be hung. The govt changed the law in response to the voters. I know that in various surveys people claim they are for the death penalty, but remember that people know surveys arn't serious and they are completing it in five seconds in their spare time.

No matter how ""small"" a nuclear power station you build, you are never going to get a nuclear-driven power station that is cheap enough for community ownership. The only difference will be that corporations end up owning lots of sites rather than one big single site. The only forms of energy at the moment that lend themselves to community ownership are Solar PV and to a lesser extent wind. Even more importantly, whereas the cost of nuclear energy has stagnated and governments are essentially locked into 40+ year contracts, the price of solar energy is plummeting. It isn't going to be long until solar energy is cheaper than nuclear energy and when that happens, the countries with a massive investment in nuclear energy are going to look a little bit ridiculous when they're physically unable to invest in these technologies on a massive scale because they're locked into expensive contracts.

With 2 children (with no disability), getting the maximum housing benefit for a 2-bedroom property, and ESA, it goes up to £552.95 (again, if  I'm adding these up correctly - which there's a good chance I'm not).

I read an article somewhere recently about a program in the states that had very positive results (something like a 50% drop in sexual assault reports on campus for those who took the course) by training women in setting clear boundaries, consent etc etc. Of course, this is a *really* difficult thing to do well, not least because it sounds an awful lot like blaming the victim...but it does seem to have been very effective, which suggests that setting clear boundaries &amp; recognising that someone who crosses them regardless is probably someone you need to get as far away from as possible are things that lots of women have trouble doing today.

This course sounds an awful lot like a sort of male yin to the yang of that women’s course - respect boundaries, communicate clearly &amp; don’t treat people like shit should surely be a program we can all get behind.

null,false,harryman100,null,null,null,"By your post and comments, it sounds like you expect to get money, but at no point have you been promised it. So legally and morally it doesn't sound like you have much of a position. Just because you think you're good, you've been told you're good it doesn't mean you're necessarily entitled to the same as other people have got. There are many other factors which will be taken into account when deciding pay rises. You might have missed a threshold for employment duration, or be in the wrong department, or have the wrong skills profile. Unless you can point to specific rules or policy which defines the conditions explicitly, you've got very little to work from. 

Some pointers:
* Once you've got it in your head that you're not in a position to demand that *anything* be done, then you'll have a much better chance of getting something to happen.
* If you've been told that things are happening, then let them happen. HR departments tend to be slow (because companies see them as an overhead, so they them), expect these problems to take months to sort out.
* Once you've been told they're done, expect it to take time to show. Payroll typically doesn't get modified until the following month. 
* Remember, that everyone you deal with is human, mistakes get made, oversights happen, holidays happen, busy periods happen, sicknesses happen. Explain your situation, give them time to work it out. Chase them up, but don't hassle them.
* Find an ally who is more senior. If you can't find someone who has the power to make things happen and thinks you deserve it, perhaps you don't deserve it.
* Play the long game, you've just started your career, so these things feel like a massive issue, but sometimes the best thing you can do for your long term career prospects is to forget about it, and move on. Continue to show that you're awesome, and you will get recognition. Recognition for long term contributions is normally more worthwhile than short term ones.

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;I think you're stumbling around in some fallacies there. I could draw the same link between American prosperity and their relaxed regulations on gun ownership, but I think that's just as unsubstantiated.

Well, we are talking about a key Enlightenment value. I'm not the first to point out that free-speech has led to better, more moral societies.  There are multiple serious academic works which have already explored this topic.  Karl Popper's books for instance.  Sorry you see that as 'stumbling around'.

In any case - the onus is on *you* (and Cameron) to show that curtailing free-speech actually helps curb bad ideas.  You want to take away a freedom?  Then show us the evidence that it's going to be worth it.

&gt;You defend the general case of free speech, which is admirable, but I think you need to defend the specific case of islamists being permitted to preach hate and division. 

Well, the free-speech argument goes something like this:

i) There's no evidence that curtailing freedom of speech will actually solve the problem. 

ii) If you ban ideas then you turn the exponents of those ideas into martyrs.  And these people feel like they're being oppressed and that the government is victimizing them.

iii) By banning ideas you're preventing the KEY method an open society has for dealing with bad ideas.  Which is to argue against them.  To defeat them with better ideas.

iv) Another really good reason for allowing hate speech is that we want to know what people actually think.  If you ban e.g. speech in support of radical Islam then you're just driving those supporters  underground and it will become less easy to tell who thinks what.

v) Related - but, a supreme court justice once wrote about free-speech 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant'.  

vi) One perverse consequence of banning ugly speech is that the speakers are sometimes actually right.  As an example - two years ago, if I saw anyone talking about 'Muslim rape gangs' I would have thought it nothing more than hate speech.  Indeed  - many of the people who would talk about it were from the racist far-right.  BUT - it turned out that there was an element of truth to what they had to say.",null,0,null,1437509775,null,0,false,0,ctbaczi,null,t3_3e1tpq,null,t1_ctbaczi,null,t1_ctb9gno,null,null,null,1438066696,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I like how we're trimming the fat to make way for more young players. I think we still need a CM (with an emphasis on looking for solidity and work rate over flashy passing and goals) and a backup for Kane. McCarthy is my top choice for CM, and the backup striker would Timo Werner (though I think that's a really long shot). Adebayor would be a good sell, and I think moving Lennon would be beneficial too. I also move Fazio on to make space for Milos/CCV to get some minutes. 

Players
Walker will return to form. Healthy, fit, in form Walker is one of the best RBs in England and would be a massive addition to the team. I think Trippier will have the Davies effect on him. I think Lamela will continue to grow, and his improvement will make our attack more deadly. I'm looking for the young players to step up and be reliable substitutes and handle domestic cup matches and early Europa league matches. 

All in all, this window has the potential to be a major turning point for the club. Manchester has bought so many players it'll be hard for LVG to bed them all in. Arsenal still hasn't gotten someone to solidify their midfield, and are ever thin in defense. Liverpool has lost an amazing player in Sterlin and seem to have added more of less quality, as they did with Suarez. City don't look particularly well rounded.

null,false,lets_chill_dude,null,null,null,"Okay, assuming the premise of the question, that we will lose in 2020, is true, what is the best way to ensure that we win in 2025? 

Firstly, people need to feel that labour actually cares about them. We need local parties to spend ten years doing as much as possible in their local communities, so that when joe everyman thinks about the election, his thoughts go ""well I don't know much about either party, but the local labour people have been at my door every other year asking if I have any thoughts on the area. I know they cleaned up the parks and one of the councillors helped my nephew get an apprenticeship, maybe I'll vote labour"". As it is, we are a faceless machine to too many people, only after our own power. 

Secondly, we seriously need decent PR people. I suggest me, but in lieu of that, just get people to help our MPs stop falling into obvious traps from the Tories, insulting the voters, and the appearance of endless in-fighting. 

Thirdly, we need to spend part of our door to door time just listening. It's really simple, you say ""have you ever voted labour, or considered it?"" And it they have, you ask ""what policies would you want to see in a labour government"" and if a majority of people say one thing, you just do it. You don't make shitty excuses, you do it. 

Fourthly, we need to destroy the Tories' one claim that won them 2015: they're economically competent, we're not. Thankfully, Osborne has been a wonderful old chap and helped us along with this. What I would love to see at least once a week for the next ten years is **every single labour tv spot** have one of our people say ""this government doubled the national debt"". Ideally, GO will fuck up enough that we will be able to say tripled. Maybe we could even have little charts. The Tories masted the strategy of repeating a lie until it stuck. Let's try the same strategy with the truth. 

Finally, when it comes to 2025, we need at *least* two big policies that are interesting. That the average 18 will care about. That the 50 yr old who never voted can care about. In 2015, our campaign was flat-out boring.
