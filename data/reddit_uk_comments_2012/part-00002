However, if someone expects racism and believes in it almost like a superstitious force not entirely unlike bad luck then they are going to see it everywhere they turn. This can develop into full blown race psychosis if left unattended.

The symptoms of this affliction are chronic paranoia and delusion. This paranoia manifests as a belief that the motives driving the actions of anyone not of the afflicted's race towards the afflicted are racial. If others are chosen favourably over the afflicted, they will believe it to be on account of their race. They will likely believe that they deserve the things they desire as if the two words have the same definition. If they are ever chosen unfavourably they will believe that they are being singled out because of their race and that they can do no wrong. They become unable to perceive that there are any reasons besides race.

In some cases, the afflicted may become so sure of their predicament or dependent on their belief of being persecuted that they may even attract the kind of ill treatment that they fear so greatly.

true,42420,irish,Leeds,"&gt;  you're just looking for an argument.

Chill out, we're just having a discussion - that's what these forums are for.

Anyway. I'l point out a contradiction first, I guess.

&gt; Me saying the killing itself was savage doesn't equal the killers being savages

You didn't call the killing savage. You said it was the work of savages, or more specifically, you asked if anyone believed it to be the work of non-savages. I wasn't arguing with that point anyway.

Now, before we get dragged into semantics, let's get back to the discussion at hand. I'll recap first, in the hope that you will understand where I'm coming from.

---

My original comment was this:

&gt;** I guess it implies that you think people from the UK are not capable of having a mental illness. . .**

To which you replied that it had nothing to do with mental illness..

Then you pointed out that it has happened before. That doesn't show me that is has nothing to do with mental illness. 

You told it me that it occurs primarily in the British-African population. That doesn't show me that it has nothing to do with mental illness. 

You told me that you *are not* saying that all black people are prone to believing this. So far, that was the first mention of ""black"" that I've seen. All I said was that your comment implied that you think people from the UK were not capable of having a mental illness. 

You told me that all *you* are saying is that it has happened before. That doesn't tell me that it has nothing to do with mental illness. 

You told me that ""you don't just become a paranoid schizonphrenic"". I never mentioned schizophrenia. I just said that your comment implied that you think people from the UK are not capable of having a mental illness.

---

Okay so that's your first reply to me covered. So you see we are not really having an argument. If this was an argument you would have proposed your argument (""This has nothing to do with mental illness"") and then defended that, but so far your first comment does nothing to defend it.

---


On to my reply. I asked you if you thought these people were sane. I asked you if your argument was that these people were nothing more than products of their ethnicity.

Back to you. You said ""nope"" to my questions, and defended your argument at last, by saying that being incredibly religious and impressionable doesn't equate to a mental illness.

--- 

So your argument is that these people are incredibly religious and impressionable. Not mentally ill. Also, most of the world is exactly the same.

So if most of the world is exactly the same, why doesn't most of the world torture and murder children?

If most of the world is exactly the same, why do you think this should not be happening in a developed country, as per your original comment.

If most of the world is exactly the same, why do you say that the UK ""isn't the middle of nowhere Africa"", and why does being from the middle of nowhere Africa make you inherently more willing to torture and murder children?

And how come if a person from ""nowhere Africa"", one who is ""obviously incredibly religious and impressionable"", tortures and murders a child, they are *not* considered mentally ill? And if they are not considered mentally ill, then what *are* they considered? Mentally sane? Mentally sane, but products of their ethnicity? 

Okay, back to you.

---

Edit: I see you've edited your comment to include this:

&gt; Pro-tip, savage isn't only a descriptive term for somebody of African origin. Are you trying to tell me that what they did wasn't animalistic? 

I know that savage means animalistic, and that was the only definition of the word I was using. I was not aware that it could also be used to describe someone of African origin. At no point did I imply that what they did was not animalistic.

You're right. That isn't racist. It's fact.

I'm not talking about this particular brand of witchcraft though. I'm not talking about whether or not this is a reflection of African religions. Read my original comment again. Actually, I'll post it verbatim:

---

&gt; This should NOT be happening in a developed country.

&gt; Do people actually believe this to be the action of non-savages?

&gt; This isn't middle of nowhere Africa

&gt; should not be happening in the UK.


It comes across as a bit. . . how can I put this. . . hmm. . .

I guess it implies that you think people from the UK are not capable of having a mental illness. . .

---

Notice how I quoted four specific lines which I thought might have questionable implications. See, I'm not arguing about the origin of their religion or anything like that. Those are facts, like you said. I'm arguing about your phrasing, and I highlighted four sentences for you to try to show you how they might be perceived. You *did* ask ""Why the hell am I being downvoted?"". I was trying to answer your question for you.

Lets look at the first and last lines:

&gt; This should NOT be happening in a developed country.

&gt; should not be happening in the UK.

So it *should* be happening in a developing country? The implication here is that a person's nationality is a good indicator of whether or not they are inclined to torture and murder children. What makes the UK inherently better?

Now, the next two lines:

&gt; Do people actually believe this to be the action of non-savages?

&gt; This isn't middle of nowhere Africa

There are two implications here: one is that the UK is not capable of producing savage behaviour; the other, that Africans are inherently savage by virtue of their ethnicity alone.

Finally, a line I didn't quote but should have:

&gt; I wish they'd all take their stupid back asswards beliefs and fuck off.

Who is ""they""? Based on the rest of your comment, ""they"" is implied to be non-UK citizens, Africans, people from developing countries. Do they all have ""stupid back asswards beliefs""? It certainly seems implicit to the statement. Where do you want them to fuck off to? It sounds like something right out of the Daily Mail. 

---

Note how I didn't call you racist. I implied it, but stopped myself just before and instead said something in the hopes that you would see the implications of what you said. I said:

&gt; I guess it implies that you think people from the UK are not capable of having a mental illness. . .

I said this because I think if someone tortures and murders a child, they must be mentally ill. The argument then focused around whether or not they were mentally ill or just a product of their culture, but to be fair it was mostly a one-sided argument because you weren't able to defend the opposing viewpoint and instead argued only against the implication that you were a racist, which was something I specifically tried to avoid. 

I believe you realise now that the implications of your original comment were fallacious, and that is why the discussion has broken down to the simple question of whether or not the attacks were savage. Again, I was never arguing with that. If it was your intention to simply call the attacks savage then that is what you should have done. Instead it was laced with anti-[African] sentiment, whether intentional or not, and I was simply trying to point that out to you. Like I said, you asked why you were being downvoted. I was simply answering, and trying to help you understand that answer. I believe that you understand now, so let's leave it at that.",0,1325886542,null,0,false,0,c3emnew,t3_o3wwt,t1_c3emnew,t1_c3em9y1,null,1428135694,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

While it sounds like it's not how it's worked out for you, a degree from Edinburgh University is, by and large, worth considerably more than a degree from Napier University (though obviously individual subjects differ, especially vocational or IT where Edinburgh is a bit outdated and Napier has strong industry links). 

To rank the three Universities slightly differently, here's some info about their research. While research doesn't always mean good teaching or support, it is quite a good indicator for employers of a University's calibre when they're taking the weight of a degree into consideration. When Universities apply for their funding, they're graded externally: the latest figures (The 2008 Research Assessment Exercise) grade Napier at 1.83, but Heriot Watt sits at 2.48 and Edinburgh is at 2.75 (pretty much as close to the top as is reasonably possible). The scale is pretty harshly limited and weighted, so Napier's research grade just doesn't compete; though it's not half bad, it's not on the globally recognised scale that Edinburgh and Heriot Watt's research is.

I'd agree that Edinburgh is definitely pretty old-fashioned and quite pretentious, though! 

That said, Napier really do fantastic work on getting their graduates employed, while Edinburgh isn't remotely as strong here.",0,1325886838,null,0,true,0,c3empdp,t3_o3zij,t1_c3empdp,t1_c3ejjyl,null,1428135720,-1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,-1

Not everyone has savings. You seem to assume having a job equals automatic savings. In my particular example, I took the first flat I could after being practically homeless. I had arranged to share a house with some other people, but at the very last minute one person decided to move to another city and the whole arrangement fell apart. My current private contract expired a few days later, new tenants were due to move in so there was no option to extend. My job and what savings I had to pay for temporary places to live such as B&amp;Bs and hotels. The experience was frightfully expensive and it dragged on and on because finding a place in the right location for my job and at the right price is almost impossible.

If I lost my job tomorrow, I would have no savings as I'm still recovering from the financial mess of being homeless, and the so-called ""safety net"" of the benefits system wouldn't be enough to catch me (as a single male under 34 I'm just not worthy).

If you have 100 men and 10 women and pick the best 5 from each you'd expect the 5 men to be more brilliant than the 5 women just on law of averages. Take a minority of a minority and then heavily select then the problem is going to be worse.

Women are not the problem, black people are not the problem and black women are not the problem. However when there is one black woman in an entire party there is a bigger chance she is going to be an idiot than the best 10 men in a vast pool of men.

The solution to political inclusion, one that helps the nation rather than the party, is to increase the base. The top level is the wrong place to focus.

Buy money before you travel. You can get very good rates from the big names if you shop around (I got a great deal on $ at an American Express travel agents). They aren't dodgy unless you use the ones at Airports or random places in the street.  You won't get the exact exchange rate anywhere, so just find the best you can.

Second option, use a credit card that doesn't have any issues on usage abroad. Many credit cards don't, whilst debit cards almost always will.

EDIT: The main issue with buying money, is that to exchange it back will cost you and the value is less when selling to a dealer.

true,purerockfury,null,null,"As a relatively new fan I realize my opinion is likely wrong as it's very uneducated, but from what my eyes see I think 5 things need to happen soon.

1) Charlie Adam is absolutely awful lately... most of his midfield passes cost us chances and turn into chance for the other team.  Why not try him and Downing as more of a forward mid, mostly for pressure and crossing into the box?  If I didn't see him for another minute I wouldn't exactly be sad...  I'd rather have Gerrard or even Downing take the kicks.

2) Glen Johnson needs to get more respect, as long as Carroll's here Johnson's one of the few who have been hitting him from where he wants it.  Carroll prefers the ball played in deep in more of a 1v1 style with the back, the low crosses from the corner and the technical passes on the ground in the box will never be his game. Which brings me to:

3) I realize he's expensive as hell, but can we loan out Carroll so he can get his confidence back?  From my years watching other sports it just seems like Carroll's got heavy shoulders from his transfer and wages, get him in somewhere that he can just relax and get his form back.  If it doesn't work, cut ties.

4) Martin Skrte and Daniel Agger have looked like men among boys in the back from what I've seen.  Granted the few games I've been able to watch the only real challenge they faced was Ba, they've definitely been an amazing duo, why people are talking about bringing up youngsters or Carragher again I couldn't begin to imagine. They are both what, 27/28?  Enjoy these two for another 5-6 years as your backbone. Keep Enrique and Johnson and you've got what looks like one of, if not the most solid back 4 right now.

5) Why are people so high on Kuyt?  All I've seen from him are failed runs and awful touches.  Haven't really seen anything redeeming about him (much like Adam).  I'd rather see someone like Maxi playing in Suarez' spot, maybe have Bellamy and Maxi split time there...

The writing worked to make the emotions you would feel watching it more genuine by taking the time to earn those emotions, so that at the end, when the power of love saves the day (pretty much)...we buy into it. Because we care about these people and who they are and what they want. This year's special never got to that point. Everyone was a blank. The soldiers in the tank thing had more personality than the family that we were supposed to be caring about. It didn't work.

EDIT: I believe it's actually been established from old school Who that Time Lords can survive in vacuum for a limited period of time. That wasn't the problem so much as the spacesuit deus ex machina thing. If actions have no consequences they are meaningless.

EDIT EDIT: That said - remote controlled furniture kind of gave this episode away as something for the kids, so there's no point in analyzing it too deeply or expecting that much from it. It was fun.

Agree about Glen Johnson - him and Enrique IMO are one of the best fullback pairings in the league... hell our back four is pretty effing good.

Carroll should not be considered a type of player that is loaned... he is going to get playing time while Suarez is out, and from there we can judge how good he really is.

Agree with Agger and Skrtel - good combo of steel with Skrtel and Agger with technique, although of course both have those qualities.

Kuyt was never one to have silky touches all the time.  But you need players to make runs, press, and there is very few who can match his industry as an attacking player.

Samba is a rock and can play both centreback or holding middie, both of which we are very injured at at the moment (Gallas, King, Daws, Parker, Sandro).  I've watched a bunch of Blackburn's games and Hoillette is in on most of their goals, he's a great winger and great at creating.  Seeing that 'Arry doesn't ever play Gio or Krancjar behind Lennon/Bale, maybe Hoilette could step in and take over that back-up winger role for when Lennon or Bale are out.

Also, it's no secret that Blackburn's owners are meatheads (pun intended), and their club has massive financial problems at the moment.  One of their main concerns is reducing wages and getting a decent transfer fee plus losing Samba and Hoilette's wages might be something would like doing.",0,1325903751,null,0,false,0,c3epcd6,t3_o61kk,t1_c3epcd6,t3_o61kk,null,1428136964,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I liked Tennant.  Honestly, season four with Donna... I have trouble finding fault with it. Loved Donna.  Loved her interactions with the Doctor.  I can't think off the top of my head of an episode I wouldn't watch. 

But, after Donna, Ten was falling apart.  He was miserable.  They'd written his  character into a miserable, pathetic, self-flagellating corner.   So many lives were messed up. There was so much guilt and drama. There was no way out of that for Ten.  I wish they hadn't completely screwed him like that because I *liked* Ten. 

Eleven came along and started everything afresh.  Which I liked.  A lot.  That's how Doctor Who is supposed to work.  New Doctor, new companions, new bits of nonsense.  Yes, it was a bit silly, but after all the trauma and guilt, a bit silly was, in my opinion, just what the show needed.  Plus, the writing was crisp and entertaining.  Moffat does funny very well.

While with the insurance and the cost of actually owning a car, the difference in raw cost is almost negligible, the value of the time saved is significant. And if you already own a car, then it is never cheaper to also use public transport.

Get past that though and you're fine. Personally I like knowing the old stories, without needing to have seen them, so haven't seen many.

In my opinion the injury problems last year came from (1) top players being involved in a massive amount of games, and perhaps not have experienced that before, (2) coming off the back of a world cup tournament, (3) training methods and regime, (4) bringing players back from injury too soon.

I really think that working on the above would be a better approach to injury problems than signing new players for the sake of it.  We should only sign players that genuinely improve our squad.

I think our transfer policy should be to purchase players who can improve the squad and genuinely push for first team places.

The long story-arcs in seasons 5 and 6 are also, in my opinion, more cohesive and fluid than the ones in earlier seasons- there was a shift from multi-part stories to single/dual episode subplots that all further a larger plot that you're in on from the start. 

I should point out that neither style is unusual in the whole show's history. The earlier Doctors were all about the neat serials, several-part storylines with a major cliffhanger every week for weeks, ala Buck Rogers, but then season 23 was all connected similarly to new season 5 (or so I am told- can't find a copy to watch).

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"I'm going to get one myself to be honest and I'm 24 years old, it sounds like a great mini PC that I can evisage a whole range of projects that it can be used for. For example I have a cheap printer that can only be interfaced via USB. This is a pain in the arse because my main computer is a MacBook Pro and I don't have a desk. So the RasPi would be great as a mini print server! 

Anyway back to the question at hand. I'm not so sure to be honest but I think it's a step in the right direction. When I was at school GCSE IT was nothing more than a two year tutorial on Microsoft Office. Don't get me wrong, these skills are very important, I'm a software developer by trade and I use Microsoft Word/Powerpoint and Excel to write technical documentation, do presentations and other things. However these sorts of skills should be moved to a different subject and NOT reserved for ICT.

The thing is the people behind the project envisage the non network enabled version to be used in schools, I'm not sure if this is a good move or not. On the one side it will ensure pupils aren't distracted by the web when they're supposed to be working, but on the other I can't help but feel they'll lose interest if they can't do things such as programming applications to interact with the web. The BBC micro came out in an era where the Internet wasn't really widespread, but todays generation has grown up with it.

When I moved to sixth form I chose A Level Computing as a subject and this was BY FAR the best introduction to computer science I could have had, our teacher was excellent (a PhD student from Nottingham University - he knew his stuff) and I think *this* is where the Raspberry Pi would be a great learning tool. 

The problem we faced in that subject was the fact that we were using the college computers for practical work and our teacher was forever in battles with the militant IT guy to allow us to install software/access locked down areas of the system so he could do his job and we could learn the material in class.

The Raspberry Pi would be great for this kind of work as it would be completely separate from the college network so the pupil can do what they like with the system and not be held back by oppressive IT policy

Oh man just talking about this has made me nostalgic for those days (I enjoyed that subject more than university to be honest) and I'm so so so excited for the Raspberry Pi to come out",0,1325939650,null,0,true,0,c3eswm7,t3_o6blm,t1_c3eswm7,t3_o6blm,null,1428138727,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The problem with the RN is not that we got rid of harriers and retired our invincibles, it's that we started replacement of those things a decade late. We should have been building 3 replacement 40,000 tonne carriers with F-18's as a gap between Invincibles and the QE class carriers with F-35's.

Chronic underinvestment leads to this sort of stuff though. People bitch and whine about spending small amounts of money on the military 'cos we supposedly never use any of the stuff we buy, then when we might actually want to use kit and don't have it, everyone whines about how what we've spent is wasted and about the lack of kit available.

Military ain't free. You want carriers and a functional army and a decent RAF, then you gots to spend money. Our insistence at using home grown kit instead of just buying US kit or producing properly with EU consortiums is slowly destroying any actual capability in our forces.

I very much agree here, though it's one of those things that I've never thought about before.  Frustrating that that means a longer wait between series though.  Also that leaves me with nothing to watch over summer, but that's just an excuse to catch up on Old Who.

This is true, but I don't think Moffat should discount the fact that The Doctor *is* geeky and silly, and that's one of the things that makes him awesome!

true,Variola13,null,null,"Masters degrees are really unsupported :-( 

You can apply for a Professional Career Development loan, the govt pay the interest on your loan until you have finished your Masters. You then pay back the loan monthly. You can apply for tuition fees and some money for living costs when you apply for the development loan. There should be some information on Direct gov, or google it if you need too. Usually there is a helpline you ring to get the information pack out, and they will look up the learning provider number code for the uni you want to apply for at the same time as you will need it for the form. The apr rate is reasonable too at 7-9%. 

However, the loan is with either Barclays or Co-op bank, if you have an account with either of them, the decision will come through quite quickly. Otherwise it can take a long long time to come through, which is a pain as they state you can't apply for it more than 2 months in advance of course start date. If you have any sort of bad credit history, that will go against you. 

You can also look at getting a personal loan out, from your bank or another one, but remember you have to pay out the loan monthly. So unless you can work at the same time as your Masters, you might struggle to make the repayments. Or you could make sure you borrow enough so you can make the repayments for the first year ( sounds daft I know). 

Depending on the uni you want to go to, you might get some bursaries, but that depends on your background. For example I know my uni only gives financial help for masters students if you are from overseas, like China or America. International students often get money from their own countries, which is why a high percentage of Masters students are international. 

Other than that, have you thought about an Mphil or Dphil? (PhD deagrees) Not knowing your subject area, I don't know how doable it is, but you might be able to get onto a fully funded Mphil/Dphil assuming the Uni you like offers Mphils. You might need a 2:1 to get onto them though. 

I am a Masters student myself, so I know how hard it is to fund all this. I ended up getting a personal loan from a friend, but it is hard financing it all.

Not ring-fencing tuition fees - or introducing them in the first place, not having the referendum on Lisbon and surrendering the rebate in the sense that if the growing feeling of resentment had been nipped in the bud or addressed earlier it wouldn't be as much an issue now, at a time when it doesn't help anyone that it is an issue.  Not offering up a referendum on the future of Trident and the nuclear arsenal.  Allowing Peter Mandelson to be trade commissioner, Baroness Ashton to be the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security.  [Not balancing the budget around 2004-2005, it was right to increase the deficit around 2001 (when it was last balanced) and the dot.com crisis, but Keynesian economics were abandoned, as the economy recovered the deficit should have been winnowed in direct relation.

&gt; The advance notice of the substantial sales drove the price of gold down by 10% by the time of the first auction on 6 July 1999.[1] With many gold traders shorting, gold reached a low point of US$252.80 on 20 July.[8] The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 billion.[8] By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion.

I honestly don't think it was the worst thing to have been done. When factoring in the interest on investments made with the gold money, it amounts to only ~£10Bn over 10 years.

UK government debt in 1995 - £370 billion

UK government debt in 2006 - £700 billion.

Yeap, they really balanced the budget there. Even taking into account inflation and GDP rises, the net debt was rising year on year, and not being ""outweighed by the preceding years' surpluses"".

&gt; It's disingenuous to imply they were the cause of the current deficits. The size of the deficits now render it a drop in the ocean.

UK government debt in 2010 - £1.1 trillion.

So it rose by £400 billion during the crisis - who was responsible for the other £700 billion?

&gt; We'd have been screwed whatever happened as we have such a massive financial sector.

We could have theoretically have gone from zero debt to £400 billion of debt - which no matter how you look at it would be vastly better than £1.1 trillion.

Now as it happens, you actually managed to totally misunderstand what I had written.

I don't have a problem with debt funded investments. Indeed, it is sensible to spread the cost over the lifetime of the value of the investment payback.

It is also wise to spend more during recessions to create economic stabilisers. That said, it is also wise to ensure that such spending is economically justified by the repayment timeframe. For example, spending £1 billion on economic measures that only generate £100 million of long term benefit is a very silly thing to do, recession or not.

However it is utter folly to fund day-to-day running costs though debt when the economy is not in a recession, and that is what the previous government was doing.

What practically every economic theory says is that during good times you pay down the debt - and the government pushed it upwards.

Did he? If so, would it have been possible to sell of the quantity of gold we sold without affecting the market?

Also, I think that overall people are taking an excessively simplistic attitude toward the whole thing.

Several other European countries were selling off their gold in the same time period that we sold ours. Furthermore, gold is massively peaking, in large part due to recession and the US's contentedness at sky-rocketing inflation rates for the dollar. The UK made long term investments with the money it got from the gold, and these investments could well turn out to be more profitable in say, a 50 year term.

Now we could argue that yes, if the UK had waited a decade and sold all its gold in 2011 then we would have made maybe 2-3 times as much money in non-adjusted dollars, sure. But who the christ thinks ""I won't sell my shiny stuff now, pretty sure there's a massive recession just around the corner""? Of course, next to no-one does.

There's way too much captain hindsight crap involved in the anger over the sale of UK gold. It was a bad time to sell, but it was sold in order that the money which was gained could be invested in investments which actually earn themselves some real money. The fact that gold has peaked 3 times in the last century, each time for unpredictable reasons, suggests to me that there are a great deal of people who lack the economic understanding that you do what seems best given the situation which exists at the time, with regards to the future as it seems like it will be, at the time. You can't cover every eventuality, and as a result, that means sometimes you lose out.

That said, the loss really wasn't particularly massive compared with the myriad other losses we've sustained as a country in the last decade, and I see far more reason to get angry about planes we built for a decade and then chopped up, or an IT system which cost as much as the government spends on 1.3 million people in a year.",0,1325958038,null,0,false,0,c3euk7w,t3_o6scq,t1_c3euk7w,t1_c3eudux,null,1428139500,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Yes.  He announced the auctions in May 1999 and the first one was 2 months later.

Can you choose when to sell? Yes.  Can you not discuss why you're selling and cut down on speculation and shorting? Yes.  Can you do it over several auctions so as to not bring the market down - that's exactly what he tried to do, only you don't mention it first!

&gt;Several other European countries were selling off their gold in the same time period that we sold ours. Furthermore, gold is massively peaking, 

It was nowhere near peaking.   As soon as the auctions were over it began to grow, and it's continuing to grow on the back of Indian and Chinese central banks.

You quote the figures and say:

&gt;Yeap, they really balanced the budget there. Even taking into account inflation and GDP rises, the net debt was rising year on year, and not being ""outweighed by the preceding years' surpluses"".

Which is clearly not true, as can be seen here:

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1997_2008UKp_11s1li011mcn_G0t

Debt was 41.92% of GDP in 1997 and 36.25% in 2008.  As a proportion of GDP, the surpluses outweighed the deficits.  Also, Labour came to power in 1997, and debt rose from 1995 to 1997, so you're doubly fudging the figures.

Whether the context is the last 50 years, 100 years, or 200 years, 36.25% is a very low figure.

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1700_2008UKp_11s1li011mcn_G0t

There's no point saying ""even taking into account inflation and GDP rises"" and then... not taking them into account!

The idea that debt rose more before the crisis than after it is so patently absurd, I feel silly responding to it.  Of course it didn't.

This graph takes into account inflation, but not GDP.  You can see that real terms rise before 2008 were dwarfed by massive rises after.

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1997_2012UKk_11s1li011mcn_G0t

In real terms, as you can see it was £417.17bn in 1997, went down to £340bn in 2002.  Then the war on terror started.  It rose to £480bn in 2008, and is due to be £918.4bn this year, and is due to continue rising.  It will more than double as a result of the crisis.

In other words, you're getting excited by a rise of £62.83bn, and a *fall* as a share of GDP, as opposed to a rise of more than £400bn, *and* a massive rise in the share of GDP!   The way things are at the moment, we're borrowing that much every few months!

&gt;However it is utter folly to fund day-to-day running costs though debt when the economy is not in a recession, and that is what the previous government was doing.

I agree with you here, despite your dodgy figures.  Though we were at war (not that it was a necessary war).  

&gt;That is the mistake they made. A damn big one.

Normally you'd be right, but, as I said, the financial crisis has been so massive, that it has completely dwarfed those rises.  As I've shown you, when you take in to account inflation, it really wasn't a particularly big rise, and when you look at the overall economy, it was a large fall.  So we'd have been in £940bn of debt instead of £1000bn... yes it's a mistake, yes it's silly, but no, demonstrably it wasn't the biggest mistake and didn't cause our current fiscal crisis.

Which would result in behavior that is abnormal, such as lashing out at his teachers with enough violence to break legs.  As you've touched upon these actions don't occur in isolation and are a result of the child environment and upbringing. This is hardly a groundbreaking conclusion to reach though as there is plenty of research which indicates that bad parenting, abuse or even something as simple as a lack of attention/being ignored in the first 2 years of life can have a negative impact on the development of a child which will be with them for the rest of their life. All I am suggesting is that this would have manifested itself prior to this incident, so we should be looking at how this was dealt with prior to developmental problems becoming a GBH incident. 

However, this:

You however are a closed mind fool, who seems to think that by correcting grammar he is being some kind of intellectual. Really you are pathetic individual: who, finding yourself inept and inadequte in most of the tasks you perform, desperately needs to find things to soothe your pathetic and shrivelled ego. Grammah is one of the rare things that allow you to do so. Am I wrong?

Still lets think this through: I, like many speakers of this langauge, say 'Could Have' in to a very short form which sounds much more like 'Could of'. So when you are moving thoughts from your inner voice to writing, it is not unthinable for your mind to misappropriate this short 'Could have' (remember how it sounds like 'Could of') down into the writting form 'Could of.' This happens to many very often. For many, they would then correct this to 'Could Have' however you may neglect to do this, especially if you were typing quickly. 




Forgive me for writing so casually in my leisure time. You are correct in saying I **could of** been more careful. You know what though? I don't give a shit what you think and never will. I am no fool and do not occupy my time with the ignorance of others.

As the situation now stands, since it received Royal Assent, if ever there is need for a public, independent inquiry into a minister, a governmental secretary or department it can no longer happen.  The minister in question whose department is to be subject of the inquiry would themselves be able to oversee the same inquiry.  If it directly relates to a minister he may be replaced for another minister, but one chosen for his loyalty to the current government/cabinet, by the cabinet, and not necessarily for his loyalty to the public,  country or office.

It effectively outlaws independent inquiry itself - and gives any government the tools to whitewash investigation, limiting the power of the judiciary and giving it to the executive.

When Patrick Finucane, a Catholic Belfast solicitor, was murdered by paramilitary loyalists in 1989 it would take 15 years for the murderers to be caught.  The problem lies in that with the conviction and ensuing public investigations arose the issue that there may have been state and police collusion into his murder.   A public inquiry was called for.  His widow was told that the state department would not release certain information and that a departmental minister would  oversee any future inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act. That's not much consolation when you want a public, independent inquiry into the possibility that the state colluded in your husband's murder.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Finucane_(solicitor)#Later_investigations_into_the_murder

Government ministers should be nowhere near the running of independent inquiries into the government, or in matters connected to the government.  It should remain solidly in the hands of the judiciary to carry out such an inquiry, and Parliament should be able to call for an Inquiry into a government - the 2005 act repealed that provision.

Every time an inquiry is held into a government, or a government's involvement, or a government's decision, this Act comes into play...

...including the Iraq War Inquiry:

&gt;""Already, the Secretary of State for Justice, the former Foreign Secretary, has vetoed a decision by the Information Tribunal and blocked the publication of the minutes of the key Cabinet meetings. He has been judge and jury in his own trial, and that makes it look as though the Government were guilty of covering something up. However, if the Government fail even to set up the inquiry that they have promised, then the charge that the Prime Minister and others have something more sinister to hide will become very toxic.""

- Edward Davey, Liberal Democrat MP for Kingston and Surbiton 

&gt;In the Inquiries Act 2005, we formally gave away any residual rights we had when the role that Parliament used to have under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was removed. At least then there could be parliamentary resolutions to set up inquiries, but that power has gone.

- Dr. Anthony Wright, former Labour MP for  Cannock Chase

It's not just that a government can block an inquiry, and then if does decide to hold one, sit on it themselves; many of the civil service permanent secretaries are still in power from government to government - you can't have them being able to manipulate inquiries for crimes in which they might be complicit.

My current 22"" flat panel that i've had for over 2 years already, if i play back a compressed 700mb movie in a window, it's just about. Full screen? Block central. 480p vs even 720p is miles apart in terms of fine detail. To me, watching a low bitrate movie encode is almost painful, as you can SEE the detail you're missing out on, and it all looks a bit washed out. Sure, there's likely to be some stuff on BluRay thats just upscaled from the DVD copy, but other things, like remastered versions, are taken from the original film print, and digitally processed to provide even higher quality than we've previously experienced. 

Again, you have to bear in mind that this is designed primarily to plug into HDTV's and HDMI Monitors with a minimum resolution of 1280x720.

On a separate but related note, both RTD and SM have said publicly that as far as they're concerned, the regeneration limit wasn't ""biological"" but rather a policy of the Time Lords, and since The Doctor is now the last of the Time Lords there's nobody to enforce it, so he has no limit any longer. And that concept works fine for me! But that's all off-the-record stuff said casually at cons and in interviews, not canonically said during an actual episode of the show.

You can also buy travel cards that last for a month for just over £200, that will cover almost all of London and immediate surrounding areas (I live just outside the city and this is what my sister uses for work). If you can, avoid the tube in rush hour, which is ~8am-9.30am and 4.30-6.30pm.

For travel around the country, I've found it's best to get to a town just outside London (Stevenage is a good place) and use trains from there, as it'll almost certainly be cheaper. If not in London, the best rule for cost effective trains is to avoid London.

London itself is full of pretty interesting stuff. The Houses of Parliament and Nelson's Column are decent sites, and most places of interest are extremely easy to get to via tube/ trains. You can have tours of many of these places, and if you love history, I fully recommend a tour of the Houses of Parliament.

If you have any interest in sport, the main Olympic site is at Stratford, and it looks pretty cool, and there are plenty of stadiums and sports to get involved with (Twickenham has an 80,000 seater stadium for England rugby matches). 

Oxford Street is the famous place for shopping, and is quite an enjoyable place, but usually crowded, otherwise there are shopping centres as Stratford and Shepherd's Bush.

Make sure you go to a pub, on a regular basis.

For food while living here, Tesco's is pretty cheap and there's seemingly one every couple of miles, otherwise Sainsbury's.

Twickenham itself is in a nice place, about 10-12 miles from central London. Not too busy given its location, except on match days.

Jobs require a special visa, though I'd bet where you study would be able to help you out with that. For child care you need to go through standard CRB checks (criminal records).

Thatcher's mistake wasn't in rebalancing the economy, as the events of the 70's showed that the UK economy was in desperate need of it, her mistakes lay more in both the speed of some reforms and in how her government failed to respond to the needs of some of the communities hardest hit by redundancy with an effective plan B.

&gt; Who cares if the rate of gun death is lower? The method by which somebody is killed is irrelevant, sir. It doesn't make much difference if you're shot, stabbed, or simply bludgeoned to death. At the end of the day they own tons of guns while maintaining a lower murder rate than you. The murder rate in Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway is much lower than that of England.

Sweden: 1.00

Do a tiny bit more research, sir. I think you'll find that the homicide rate varies greatly from state to state over here. You'll also find that the states with the strongest gun control (Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and D.C.) have the highest homicide rates in the country.

Come over here and take a walk through either Chicago or D.C. where gun control laws are the strongest in America. I would put money on you getting shot within an hour.

Vermont is nothing special with 1.1 homicides per 100,000 people. Yes, that is very slightly lower than the UK as a whole, but compare that to the UK's safest county: Norfolk, of which I'm proud to be a resident. Here there were 9,186 *crimes against the person* which includes all violent crime and murder. That's in a population of 862,400. That's a violent crime rate of 1.07 per 100,000 people. That's lower than Vermont's homicide rate, which is just one small part of violent crime overall.

I know where I'd rather live.

&gt;The danger in considering cultural differences is that of stereotyping people. All of us are unique. To say, for example, that “Russians do this” and “Vietnamese believe that” is both foolish and possibly dangerous. First, it is important to distinguish between stereotypes and generalizations. They may appear similar, but they function differently. For example, if I meet a Mexican woman named Maria and assume that she has a large family, I am stereotyping her. But if I say to myself, “Mexicans tend to have large families; I wonder if Maria does,” then I am generalizing. A stereotype is an ending point, and no effort is then made to ascertain whether it is appropriate to apply it to the person in question. A generalization, on the other hand, serves as a starting point.

I have to be honest I'd always thought the term stereotype and generalisation where interchangeable, but anyway that doesn't really affect my point.

[Here's the link to the full study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070887/) if you want to read the rest. It largely confirms what you've said, understanding cultural differences can be useful.

Hampton Court Palace, Henry VIIIs swanky pad.

The Eel Pie pub (central Twickenham). Nothing famous, It's just my favourite pub around there. It's named after nearby Eel Pie Island which was a famous party spot for the rich and fashionable.

Twickenham Rugby museum (lots of old kit and trophies, that kind of thing, but you get an inside look at the stadium)

The mainline from Twickers to central London is only ~20mins but if you're heading to South-West london you can go to Richmond then hop on the District Underground line.

And Brooke's sacrifice at the end... it says a lot about the respect that this **family** show gets that they are allowed to have something like that when the plot needs and deserves it.

The thing that I like is that it wasn't totally out of character for him either. It's already been mentioned a few times that the Doctor has his companions in order to keep an eye on him as much as anything. That was part of the thing in the alternate *Turn Left* timeline/universe - without Donna being around, he ended up dying himself because he stays around to watch the Racnoss being killed, to get his vengeance watching them die.

I was a tiny bit excited (after the fact) because it was another moment where the dark side of the Doctor can be seen. In the old series (during Season 23: *The Trial of a Time Lord*, sixth Doctor), there was a character called the Valeyard.

However, there are exceptions to this rule and ways around it. The timelords resurrected The Master and gave him a new regeneration cycle.

This implies it is possible to give regeneration cycles to timelords.

However, nothing is known about the actual process, it could require timelords to do so.. (in which case Jenny might make a glorious return :P)

It also wasn't stated why 12 was the limit for amount of regenerations. Perhaps it's biological..or perhaps timelord society didn't allow timelords to regenerate further than that.

There's tons of ways around it, so don't worry about it too much.

&gt;I should probably take the writer's plans over the actor's beliefs, but anyone care to explain?

Moffat didn't say the 12th regeneration would occur then, he merely mentioned that information in the same Q&amp;A.

It's worth noting that Moffat never said when the Ponds are leaving, except for Season 7. It's possible they leave halfway through or even earlier than that.

As for Matt Smith, I'm not sure, he will definately do all of season 7, that's what his contract says anyway. Season 8? Perhaps, no contract for that yet...

In addition/to reinterate what I already said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/o3149/rdoctorwho_moderation_discussion_memeimagemacro/c3dyrr8):

I think a new subreddit should be opened to accommodate for all the banned material. This way, people still get what they want, it just won't clutter up elsewhere as much. I stand by the ""helping run it"" thing.

NO exceptions should be made. If exceptions are allowed, possibly for rare occasions/pics/whatever then that could only lead to there being an indecision about what specifically is allowed/not allowed and thus that would allow more things to flow though and the rules would become useless. No This needs to be  B+W and ""policed"" to the core. Yes, it sounds harsh but it will only seem harsh for a while.

If people are that desperate it to be posted here then I would suggest that every day or 2 days or week or whatever, a self post would be made linking the top 5 posts from the new subreddit. (though you could easily argue against that I know but I'm just putting it out there). Or, if a post crosses a certain ""vote count"" like 50, 100, 200 or whatever, then it could be cross posted to the parent one.

The argument, in any subreddit, always seems to be that meme posts/silly pictures/whatever detracts away from real discussion. In my experience, it doesn't at all. For starters, I have never seen episode discussion here stifled because there was a rage comic floating on the front page of [/r/Doctorwho](/r/Doctorwho). There has always been strong discussion here for as long as I've been here. Secondly, those meme posts/pictures always spur discussion themselves. Not just on this subreddit, but others as well. I have yet to see a subreddit in which discussion was not prominent in these meme posts.

Honestly, if a lot of the content here died, I'd probably come here less often. I mean, think about it really, what point *would* there be for most people to be here with no episodes coming until much later this year? The closer you get to a pure discussion/self post subreddit, the less there is reason to be here that isn't within 48 hours of a new episode.

**EDIT: Oh, and I almost forgot. I think the only exception is that we should allow 'X actor is in Y film' posts, but should not allow reposts. It's my personal opinion that I just like knowing what former/current actors of Who are doing, but on the same token I don't think we need 3 front page posts of 'OMG, David Tennant to appear in a Sherlock episode** *!""

I also voted for ""My Newest XYZ"" but that's just because I don't give a shit if you can spend money.  Come back when you've made your sonic screwdriver actually *do* something.

If we're concerned about there being ""enough"" material, let's start a project of some sort instead of flooding the place with bullshit.  Fanworks of all sorts are awesome (costumes included), naming your pet Rory or the fact that you bought memorabilia isn't.

As for project ideas...classic discussions don't work for more than a very niche group, we've tried that.  Why not get some of the drawing Whovians together to collaborate on a fan comic?  Or have a theme challenge?

The Harry Potter subreddits have monthly House Cup tournaments for bragging rights and there's not even anything new coming out of that series anymore (well...Pottermore, but not the way DW is ongoing), there's no reason we shouldn't be able to set up some sort of participation-fueled event.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"""All the long-running female companions of Doctor Who!""? What, did this show begin in 2005? Did Russel T. Davies arbitrarily choose to start the series at the Ninth Doctor?

Look, I know *Doctor Who* has reached a generation of fans who grew up without the classic series. I get that, it's great. But to say that four companions constitutes ""long-running"" suggests that you're either completely (and willfully) unknowing of the show's history, or that five years to is somehow ""long-running"".

Which even then doesn't make sense because Rose Tyler was a companion for two years, Martha Jones for one year, Donna Noble for a year, and Amy Pond for two-and-a-half years (by the time Karen Gillan leaves the show). Plenty of the Doctor's *other* female companions (you know, Before Rose, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth and Ctuhulu was wide awake) were with him much longer than the ""long-running"" period of a year.

I don't know what it is, but something about this drawing set me off in a way the other attention-span-challenged new-Who stuff on Reddit has failed to do. 

tl;dr **How in Michigan can you call the companions since the 2005 revival ""long-running""? Three of them aren't even part of the show anymore.**

EDIT: This isn't meant as a personal attack against you, or your artwork; please don't see it that way. I'm just a little bit tired that every post in /r/doctorwho seems to be about, or from, 2006 onwards. Hell, I'm surprised that people even remember Christopher Eccleston played the Doctor once upon a time, because everything is David Tennant this, Matt Smith that, Karen Gillan this, Alex Kingston that. 

Which, again, is great, because all four of those actors have done a marvelous job adding to the depth, complexity, history and richness that is *Doctor Who*. But there was depth, complexity, history and richness from 1963 to 1989 (plus the TV movie in 1996), and it seems that practically none of Reddit remembers, or acknowledges, this. That's not even taking into account the hundreds of books and audio plays that kept *Doctor Who* alive when the BBC wanted nothing to do with the program.

And, regretfully, your drawing seems to encapsulate my frustration.

The problem is that this kind of stuff does not reach the front page because more people like it. It reaches the front page because looking at a cute picture with a blue cat takes less time than reading a 10 line post about something. If reading a 10 line post takes 2 minutes and looking at a tardis dress takes 10sec it will take the same time to upvote 12 tardis dresses than to upvote a theory. If you factor in time the tardis cakes aren't upvoted more than that theory, they are upvoted in less time and thus fly to the top.

One example of this is this topic, It is a topic POSTED BY A MODERATOR about the FUTURE OF THIS SUBREDDIT and is right now at position 19 preceded by 18 posts like the ones I described in my previous posts.

About creating a new subreddit about DW, I've seriously thought about it, but:

- I won't do it without the mods from DW deciding the way they want to proceed first.
- I won't do it without the blessing of DW mods.
- If I am to do it I would pretty much want the DW mods to be part of it as I feel they do a wonderful job.
- I won't do it before the 29 January (Real Life Stuff (TM))

Lots of Polish people find their way to the UK every year and a lot of them manage well.  Why are the two so different?  Don't you think  China and India are more different to the UK than Poland is?  Having said that, I've never been to Poland, but I'd be surprised to find out otherwise.  This has been mentioned elsewhere, but if you think about it you've probably got more in common with someone in your demographic is Poland, France, Italy or Spain, than someone in a very different demographic in the UK (yet you probably don't want to kick them out into a different country).

Politics changes little over long periods of time (US opposition to state healthcare hasn't changed because underlying principles in US politics haven't).  Economy is more volatile, but the comparison is between states in their current situation.

I also get a little confused as to why Doctor Who references in other media amaze people. After all, it's been a part of TV culture in the UK since 1963 so other UK TV programmes will reference it (how often does star wars/trek get a mention in something?). I assume this is something to do with the relaunch being much more popular than the classic series in the US?

A lot of the posts about previous Doctor Who actors in new things are slightly odd if you think about the longevity of the programme. It would be like posting pictures of Davison in All Creatures Great and Small or Pertwee as Worzle Gummage.

The posts I enjoy (and sometimes reply to) are either questions, peoples theories and ideas for stories. I quite enjoy a next doctor suggestion post but they can get repetitive if people continually post the guy from firefly :)

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think that if you've spent your time properly learning and understanding the material, you will ace your exams.  In that respect, the people who do *very* well on their exams will genuinely tend to be the people who are better at the subject.  
  
However, for those who don't instantly develop the correct study methods at school, who may have had consistent reinforcement of the idea that they were bad at something because of it not clicking instantly, and who may well have lost motivation for certain subjects or for school in general (ie most of us), I think that exam results are an indication that schooling does a poor job of actually educating people.  
  
Most people need to learn how to learn, and school does a terrible job of 1) getting that message across and 2) actually teaching the necessary skills.  Learning the correct way to read, to take notes, to think about the subject and the module in question, will make the time you spend on schoolwork so much more efficient that you can end up doing less work and getting better grades, and most importantly developing true *understanding* of the subject matter.  Schools seem to think that concentrating harder, and just working for longer, will be effective, but they're not.  
  
So while I do think that exams are a good indicator of how well you know the subject, I don't think your knowledge of the subject is a fair reflection on how conscientious you were at school - I think it's a reflection of how fortunate you were in randomly learning how to learn, despite the school's best efforts to misguidedly point you in the wrong direction.",0,1326031074,null,0,false,0,c3f3k59,t3_o7x6w,t1_c3f3k59,t3_o7x6w,null,1428143819,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

So people having this thought in the back of there mind, think 'well if there going to treat us like racists, may as well live up to there expectation'.

This was evident in past years to, my Dad who was a season ticket holder through most of the late 70's and the majority of the 80's, saw this with the brand that scouse fans were thieves, he and a lot of his friends who wouldnt usually even contemplate nicking stuff, did, just because of the thinking, 'if everyone thinks its true anyway, may as well get some free stuff out of it'.

I am not saying they are the same, but the principle is. We get told some many times this is what we are by opposing fans and the media, we actually turn it to it.

TL;DR: we used to get called thieves so we thieved, we are now thought of as the  racist supporting club, so we will be racist.

true,ekhornbeck,null,null,"Random thoughts:

I personally prefer exams, as chronic procrastination and second-guessing makes continuous assessment torturous for me.  I love the pressure and the adrenaline rush in an exam.  

However, I realise I'm in the minority and that most people hate exams.  

I've taught at university level (arts/social sciences), and watched a student I had taught (and therefore knew she was capable of the work) completely freeze up in a class exam.  I said 'you may begin', and she just tensed up and stared maniacally at the paper.  It took her about fifteen minutes to even attempt to write anything.

On the other hand, exams serve some students well, probably better than they think, because the time constraints force them to focus on the question and they produce much more tightly-written work.

Exams *do* test how knowledgeable you are in a given subject.  Even if you're impervious to stress and blessed with perfect recall, you still have to have a good knowledge of the subject in order to pass.  However, there are people who do have a good knowledge of their subject but do badly in an exam setting. 

It's probably a good idea to differentiate between school-level and university-level exams.  By and large, school exams test recall under pressure.  I remember that we essentially produced tons of practice essays throughout term on the possible questions that could come up.  If you reproduce that essay in the exam, then you had no problems.

University exams, however, love to throw weird questions at you and see if you can formulate a decent response given your knowledge of the subject (I did English and history, I know science and engineering exams will be different).  They test not only your knowledge, but your ability to think under pressure - analyse the question, apply your knowledge and write a coherent response.

I think that doing badly in exams has become a bit like 'being bad at maths' or 'not being able to do languages'.  We've sort of accepted it as an acceptable given.  I think there are ways to address the problem, and that changing this mindset would help.",0,1326033402,null,0,false,0,c3f3qci,t3_o7x6w,t1_c3f3qci,t3_o7x6w,null,1428143893,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Although I suspect that at least in part exams test the students ability to do exams, as opposed to thier knowledge of the subject, I do think they have a place. At school, exams are useful because stress and pressure are normal parts of adult life, and school is not just about teaching academic subjects but also about providing students with the skills that are needed in adulthood.  Some people flourish in this environment.  This doesn't really hold out at university level though.

Continuous assessment/coursework suffers from the problem of bias - for example students with the best relationship with the tutor often do better than students that avoid the tutor.  This is very prevelant at University level.

&gt; Also have a higher percentage of the overall mark be from coursework and essays to stop exams just being all about memorising certain things and not actually knowing the subject.

Can't say I agree with this, relies too much on teachers obeying exam guidelines. It is pretty easy for a teacher to give too much feedback on a draft piece of written coursework, and I remember my examined science practicals being an absolute farce (anyone who has done an AQA ISA will know what I mean).

For the sciences, I think better exam papers would be the key, more 'open' questions that aren't asking for regurgitation of facts or definitions, but either getting you to work something out or extended answer questions where the student has the opportunity to score marks by openly exploring the question. Some of the best, well written and challenging questions from my A-level science papers were the ones where you had to write about a phenomenon or experiment in a lot of detail.

I worked my arse off and managed to stun my teachers at first (thanks partly to some degree level chemistry - thank you Dr. Mark Nason of Chichester College) with what I'd put together, HOWEVER, according to the system, you had to follow exact procedure, i.e. the introduction must include every one of these, and the next section must include every one of those, otherwise EVERY MARK FROM THEN ON DEFAULTS TO 1. So, when the teacher sat down to actually mark it (bearing in mind I'd already shown them a draft), 8/8 for my introduction, and then somewhere along the line I forgot one tiny piece of information...bam, I received a 3/8 and the rest died at meager 1s.

I just want to state this once and for all, unequivocally: I hate you OCR AS Human Biology. We could've been friends. I well and truly loved studying you, and it was all for moot.

i'm a former mechanic. All mechanics have the same view of the MOT - a piece of paper that is utterly worthless once the car leaves the test station. And thats before we even get to the MOT fiddles. There's lots of cars bought from dealerships with a full MOT on that never even saw the test station. There's those sold that have failed and the dealerships MOT station has accepted a phone call that they've done the work as proof and printed out a certificate...

It is easy beyond belief to get a MOT without the car being tested even with the new system.

&gt;  The MOT isn't about keeping all cars road worthy all the time.
So considering the point that was originally made, its no good for ensuring cars are safe to do 80MPH is it?

&gt;  Most cars are not doing 200k miles in 2 years.

The majority of cars sold are bought by fleets. Most fleet cars will do 20k or more per year and will have over 60k on the clock come first MOT.

They will do a prick test and then if all goes well you will lie on a bed and have a needle inserted into your vein (by a doctor) at your elbow , this is a slightly larger needle than you may be used to but it is not that painful (I do it and I am a wimp).
You will have about 500ml taken which, depending on how you bleed, will take 10-20 minutes and you will be under supervision from a nurse at this time (one nurse for every 5-8 people in my experience). Once the blood has been taken you will be monitored for at least 15 minutes (and given a drink) to ensure you are okay.

That is pretty much what they did even when I was there. They'd just got some sort of performing arts status and lots of money for a gleaming recording studio and drama bits. Meanwhile the main hall looks like it was still in the 70s and during a summer holiday the roof of the science block caved in (it got fixed, but it shows where their priorities lied).

There was a huge wall of plaques or pictures featuring the headmaster shaking hands with &lt;celebrity&gt; - and in his desire for vanity the new theatre the school has is named after him.

&gt; If the school down the road has shiny new kit you need the same to attract pupils through the door when parents start looking round secondaries.

They used to be able to do that based on their academic performance, and the stereotype that the other ""competing school"" was the one all the druggies and layabouts go to. If parents are now basing school choices on how things look then I continue to despair.

&gt; EDIT: I agree they should probably have stuck to PCs but the Head and teachers will want the shiny kit and will probably force it through without asking the IT Manager. Or as you said offer him a new Mac...

I'd say it is all three agreeing with each other. Head gets shiny kit, teachers get Apple kit to ""train on"" at home and the IT manager gets the taxpayer to pay for toys he doesn't want to spend his own money on.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;That is pretty much what they did even when I was there. They'd just got some sort of performing arts status and lots of money for a gleaming recording studio and drama bits. Meanwhile the main hall looks like it was still in the 70s and during a summer holiday the roof of the science block caved in (it got fixed, but it shows where their priorities lied).

The specialist status money can only be spent on those subject areas though. I don't know where ours went but we never got new science labs like they said we would...

Despite getting in to politics, and PFI and the state of the economy, Labour were essentially right with their ""Building Schools for the Future"" scheme - the main block of the place I work in is now over 50 years old, you can't just keep patching it up and hoping it'll go for another 50...

Every time something new gets added, or something gets rebuilt it makes the rest of the place look worse.

&gt;There was a huge wall of plaques or pictures featuring the headmaster shaking hands with &lt;celebrity&gt; - and in his desire for vanity the new theatre the school has is named after him.

Lol, ours hasn't done anything like that yet.

&gt;They used to be able to do that based on their academic performance, and the stereotype that the other ""competing school"" was the one all the druggies and layabouts go to. If parents are now basing school choices on how things look then I continue to despair.

The issue now is schools converting to Academy Status get lots of money to rebuild and put new kit in. We're surrounded by them as we border another county very closely, most of their places are academies. When we go over to academy status there will be some extra money, but it won't get us a brand new building or anything ""big"" sadly.

EDIT: Most parents I see on our open evenings do talk of comparing academic performance, subjects offered, ofsted reports etc. But if the place down the road is a new build or has better science labs that might factor in to where they apply for.

&gt;I'd say it is all three agreeing with each other. Head gets shiny kit, teachers get Apple kit to ""train on"" at home and the IT manager gets the taxpayer to pay for toys he doesn't want to spend his own money on.

Some IT Managers have control over where their budgets are spent (like my boss), others are just there to manage while finance buy everything in.

IT Manager's budget is all taxpayer's money anyway.",0,1326046026,null,0,true,0,c3f581s,t3_o7n6q,t1_c3f581s,t1_c3f4u3b,null,1428144597,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Irongate,uk,"Walthamstow, London","&gt;Exams do test how knowledgeable you are in a given subject. Even if you're impervious to stress and blessed with perfect recall, you still have to have a good knowledge of the subject in order to pass. However, there are people who do have a good knowledge of their subject but do badly in an exam setting.

That is me down to a tee. I knew the material inside-out and back-to-front, but I completely locked up for the first ten minutes of an exam last semester. 

I did do quite well after that, but I still feel that I've always benefitted more from writing coursework essays - in terms of learning *and* grades. The revision for the lion's share of exams that I've taken have focused very much on memorizing a small pool of designated 'crucial details', whereas the coursework essays that I've written have generally involved working with more of a lake of material. When I look back on modules that had coursework assessments I can remember whole forests of information, but with exam-assessed modules it's more a matter of remembering a handful of trees. I think that there's a good case to be made for that being more to do with how revision is directed than with the exam as a form of assessment *per se*, but I'd say it's a problem nonetheless.

&gt; Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the general body of people as determined by a government, media outlet, or other controlling body.  

Wikipedia.

&gt; Censor: an official who examines books, plays, news reports, motion pictures, radio and television programs, letters, cablegrams, etc., for the purpose of suppressing parts deemed objectionable on moral, political, military, or other grounds. 

Dictionary.com

Yes, certainly there is going to be some censorship if you want to keep a discussion community focused.  But ask yourself, do you really want to censor things based on the opinion of some folks likes and dislikes alone?

If you really want some kind of exclusive ""talk about only what I want to hear"" community, that's fine, go start one.  But in a general community, if you want to serve the whole fan base, rather than just a few individuals in it, then you welcome everyone, and let the stuff that people want to see/hear get voted up, and let the stuff people don't generally want to see/hear get voted down, or just ignored.

If people in this community are upvoting pictures of bow ties, then obviously some people enjoy that sort of thing, and your option is to either be some kind of Dalek and shoot them down, or be like the Doctor and say, ""Isn't the universe amazing and full of stuff you never imagined you'd find, such as a whole group of people who just like to look at bow ties and say how cool they are?"" :-)

The story of Nathan, Marnie and the baby was brought up completely out of the blue.

That final story line of him didn't exactly fall into the patterns that were previously set out for his character before so I doubt they were planning on setting up the entire 3rd series around a story line they brought up and almost concluded in one episode. 
Series three also wasn't very different from the rest of the series, it had some episodes based on new characters powers, it based some on current characters powers and focused on the relationships between the main cast (mainly simon and alisha this time around).

An old acquaintance from Uni who I really don't know why is a facebook friend of mine said something along the lines of:

&gt; have that you Hammer gays :D come on now...

then immediately:

&gt; Disclaimer - the term ""gays"" is not meant in an offensive context!

I decided not to let it lie and asked 

&gt; ‎""Katy Perry also recorded the song: 'You're so gay'; it sounds homophobic, but of course, she's using the other fashionable version of the word meaning: anything generally bad. Anyone who thinks that sounds offensive should just jew off and just stop being so bloody black about it. "" - Simon Amstell    
What context did you mean?

A very lengthy conversation followed, where I made it clear that I did not think the OP was actually homophobic or intending to be, but had essentially made a homophobic statement implying that an association with 'gay' was somehow wrong.     
The usual ""I wasn't being rude *about* or *to* homosexuals"" response was used several times as well as questioning why I was making such a big deal about it. I wasn't really, just asking for an explanation as to why calling something gay, meaning a negative, was somehow not homophobic in a wider context. I'm not sure that ""gay"" has shifted away from meaning 'bad' *because* it is still associated strongly with being homosexual.

I did bring up the Gervais/mong issue, to point out that even though someone might not mean ""mong/gay"" as being bad, there was still the problem that it *does* mean that in a wider context.

I imagine that a good many people will think I was making a fuss over nothing. I wouldn't mind knowing your reasoning, but also if you do agree with me - why exactly? I'm interested in people's formulations because - I need to make clear - I am not a member of the PC brigade (how many people actually are?) and am quite happy for freedom of speech to exist. Being a fan of Frankie Boyle, I imagine that quite a few people will wonder how I can get irked when a sort-of-friend uses gay as a derogatory term.

But, two things that I always think about when the matter of the Doctor's morality/ethics comes up is:

* Nine (and Eleven's) sheer hatred of the Daleks.
* The Tenth's destruction of the Racnoss' children
* Ten's revenge on the Family of Blood
* Eleven's: ""Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many.""

All those situations suggest to me that he can and will do stuff that are not the actions of a highly moral man. Mostly Ten's horrific revenge on the Family. That still makes me shudder and was in no way acceptable.

The first is that I have found a lot of students live at home or in houses far away from the college and so they miss out a lot on the social life and don't really attempt to make much effort in making friends.

Secondly, Goldsmiths is very different to a campus university. You have London on the doorstep and New Cross Road running through the middle. I went to Nottingham University to visit a friend and the experience was completely different. It's basically a huge park with just students in the area. Everyone is much closer to each other and you are secluded from the public so you end up doing things with other people all the time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Unless you're studying those things specifically, I doubt they would come up. I took a history of animation class, and there's so much diverse animation styles, that I seriously don't think that it would be brought up unless it was (in my class's one day example) Grave of the Fireflies,  Metropolis, and Spirited Away.

I am not saying that those series are good, I am only saying that there's a much broader spectrum that it's going to get passed over since there are things that can depict the same thing something like K-ON! has except bigger and better. I've seen K-ON!, Macross Frontier, and several things from Shaft Works, and it's nothing special. 

This doesn't mean that I personally don't find them impressive or fun to watch. I've been going to anime cons since '04 and cosplaying since '07. It's just, let's be real. Most people who are studying fine arts won't care about anime unless it's your specific area of interest. The fact of the matter is that anime just isn't as commercial as you would think it would be in America, if you are an anime fan or describe yourself as an otaku. It's just not. I'm sorry, but going to the Art Institute to get a degree in Video Game character design is likely to get you a job at Taco Bell or a local sushi restaurant. I know waaaay too many artists who are damn good at anime who can't get a job or can't sell their art work for more than what people on deviantART or con-goers can afford because it's not something America, as a whole, is interested in. 

You're also speaking to someone who has a Bachelor's degree in Japanese Art History, and let me tell you, only rare shits are given about Asian art on the broad American spectrum on a university level. I'm minoring in Time Arts and Animation while getting a new degree in Graphic Design as well. Anime isn't as common in a university setting. 

EDIT: I also just wanted to say that I would love it if I got the chance to watch anime in class again. I'm trying to be wholly realistic with you, but I do want to say that I've been drawing Sailor Moon since 1996 and still do. I've been in the anime thing for a while and have no animosity towards it.

- It isn't censorship because a tardis mug does not convey a message thus is not a speech. 

b) ""by some governing body, based on some personal ideal of what isn't acceptable"" 

- This is called living in society. You cannot decide to go out and kill people because that is the way you express yourself. Sorry. If that is censorship to you then censorship it is!

c) Do you serve everyone who is interested in the topic, by allowing people to talk about what they want to talk about as long as it's related (in their mind), with as little censorship as possible?

- This was what we were trying to discuss before you accused the mods of dictatorship. It seem that everyone that does not agree with you is a tyrant... mmmm  ""your own personal idea of what is good enough"".


Look, nobody is trying to sensor you, to censor you we would have to care about your tardis mug.... The point is, we don't. I don't hate your tardis mug, and I'm sure nobody else does, what we hate is that you decide to post a picture of your tardis mug everyday twice a day. We get that you love your tardis mug, and is beautiful and all that stuff, but we are trying to talk among ourselves here and can't hear what we are saying because you keep screaming in everybody ears that you have a blue tardis mug.... The point is not your tardis mug, the point is that you are annoying, I'm sorry but it is like that. We aren't trying to prohibit you from talking about your tardis mug because we don't like your tardis mug and don't want anybody else to know about it and how blue and great it is, we are trying to prohibit you from talking about your tardis mug because you cannot talk about anything else and you don't let anyone else talk. 

I cannot explain why it is not censorship simpler than that. I hope you didn't get offended, and I hope you slightly at least understand where we are coming from.

In my course we also have practical exams and viva exams. I hate the practicals, because I will be asked to perform a procedure that I have done dozens of times before under supervision, and freeze up and get it completely wrong, however viva exams are much better. They test your knowlege in a more relaxed environment, test your communication skills and your actual understanding, rather than just your powers of recall.

This, knowing full well Evra has stated that Suarez is not a racist, and the FA have stated that Suarez is not a racist. Doesn't matter now..

The reason I believe it is at best moving horizontally rather than up as far as the quality of the team, is because Napoli has just as rich of a history as Chelsea, just as good of a fan base - if not better, and have a more realistic chance of winning a league title in the next 5 years.

Also the pick of stuff as far as I can see on netflix is pretty good, is is mostly the same stuff that's on the iplayer? We also have Lovefilm on the ps3 is that better for films? 
And can I set up my ps3 to stream from netflix in anyway if I do sign up? We can ofcourse connect the computer to the tv screen and watch it like that, but that's a bit of a pain to do everytime we wanna watch something, right now we have the ps3 connected by media server to the computer so we can just open movie files directly on the ps3.

true,drhodesmumby,eu,"Salford/Grimsby, UK","I dislike exams greatly, particularly when they only occur infrequently and in blocs - the concept of an exam season is probably one of the most horrible things in education.

There ends up being too much riding on a single day or single week, leaving you utterly screwed if at the time you're not quite up to scratch - perhaps you're ill, perhaps you're tired, perhaps you're upset, perhaps for whatever reason you're simply not at your best (it may well be the stress of the exam period itself which has that effect, particularly when said exams can constitute between 50-100% of your mark!).

Even if you manage to attend the exam at times like these, your performance simply won't be as good as it would be were you not feeling so crap at the time. It's simply placing far too much reliance on one day to assess a person's capabilities.

Coursework has a similar issue - perhaps you simply get a bad question or, once again, something upsetting or otherwise damaging happens during the period that you're meant to be completing the work. There's far too much weight on specific pieces of work and specific periods of time once more.

I'd favour a replacement with a form of continuous assessment. A short test/essay once every two weeks or so, marked as quickly as possible, which would contribute to your overall grade, with the average of your assessed pieces constituting your grade at any given point in time. The form of assessment would ideally be as varied as possible - essays, exam questions, presentations, group sessions, oral arguments and so on - in order to ensure that you're both testing a wide range of skills and so as to not unfairly penalise anyone who simply didn't deal well with any particular form of assessment.

Coupled with periodic refresher assessments some time after the initial assessment to ensure that you've actually retained the knowledge, I think you could end up solving a great number of the problems caused by the current system in a stroke.",0,1326098614,null,0,false,0,c3fd3jd,t3_o7x6w,t1_c3fd3jd,t3_o7x6w,null,1428148375,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Now, compare this to a few years ago, when they looked at derbies as being a quick easy victory, and no-one really broke a sweat about it. They think this victory has made their season, and that they have won the FA cup and the league.

If you want to get CCTV footage enquire with your local council. They can view the footage before hand and see if whether or not the incident was caught. You need to give them a specific timeframe to search from. Once they find the incident, if captured on CCTV, you have to pay a surcharge for them to prepare it for you. Usually around £15.

Second, get written statements from everyone involved and who can vouch for you. If they can't prove you were all intoxicated, which you probably were, the statements hold some weight. If they state ""We were hammered"" you've already lost. Not saying that you should lie but don't bother taking statements from those who have been drinking heavily. If you have any people who saw the incident, but don't know you personally, get a statement from them if you can.

Third, if you haven't already taken pictures of the damage done to yourself, and your belongings, do so now. Make a note of what was damaged.

Now you're going to have to contest the charge in court, if it gets that far, or more likely through the council. State that you were held under duress and that you wouldn't have signed it if you didn't feel threatened and intimidated by their use of force and by how aggressive they were. Hopefully you have the names of the officers in question and if I were you I'd make use of a civil liberties group. 

Release are known for being fairly effective.

Anyway. 

Plead your case and hope for the best. If you're not usually thrown in the back of a van that'll reflect well on you and should clear your name. 

Hope this helps.

**• holds an opponent **  
• spits at an opponent  
• handles the ball deliberately (except for the goalkeeper within his own penalty area)

Conclusion: You can change the past if the consequences of changing the past only manifest in your future. By acting like this you are acting like always, in the present, your present.

You cannot change the past if the reason that compels you to change the past already happened. 


Another example:

You have an exam January 15. The exam goes like shit, and on January 18 you go back to January 14 and give yourself the exam. You just created a paradox.

You have an exam on January 15, on January 14 you travel to January 18 and get the exam from yourself. On January 15 you Ace the exam and on the 18 you give it to yourself who comes to visit. Casualty is maintained no paradox.

The desired end result is in your future (relative time)? -&gt; No paradox.

The constitutional status of Scotland and Northern Ireland, while similar in legislative terms, are not linked in any meaningful way. Thus, if the Scots did leave the union, it wouldn't cause a change in the status of Northern Ireland.

If what you are suggesting is that Scottish independence would trigger an examination of the Northern Irish status, the answer is again, no. Formally, the issue has been 'resolved' by the Good Friday agreement and the 'Principle of Consent'. Meaning, there is no legal barrier to Northern Ireland leaving the UK so long as it was the desire of the majority on both sides of the Island.

There's a form of seizure that lasts for a few seconds where the person has it and says things without being aware they said them - often gibberish but just as often something that was in the back of their mind they had no intention of saying but because of the seizure interfering with impulse control, it comes out. Unfortunately, because it was a seizure, the person has no memory of the event so they are entirely unaware they said anything at all.

The answer to your question is less clear-cut than the old referendum. The latest poll data we have focuses more on self-identity rather than whether borders should be redrawn. Latest polls appear to show that Protestants will generally identify themselves as 'British' or, to a lesser degree, 'Northern Irish'. Catholics appear to view themselves primarily as 'Irish'.

This is by no means conclusive and is extrapolating surmises from broad statistics, but if you look at population totals, broad demographic views and the like, you are looking more on the lines of 2:1 in favour of being part of the UK.

Technically on British roads if they aren't marked otherwise the road defaults to the normal speed for a road of that kind. For motorways that is 70mph. This is why there are repeater signs in between the cameras on a variable speed limit motorway. The highway code requires constant reconfirmation of any abnormal speed limit. The same rule applies on variable speed limits as to one laned country roads that have been limited to 50 for whatever reason.

For convenience the average cameras mark when the lower limit ends with a national speed limit sign. However not displaying anything also means national speed limit. Regardless the cameras are still on at 70mph when the lights are all off.

As for margin of error. Yes they have one but that is because the devices actually have a margin for error. It is possible to be driving at 70mph and get clocked at 74mph. The margins are so that people doing this aren't caught out. This doesn't mean you can safely drive at 77 if the margin is 10%. If you drive at 77 then the device might clock you at 84.

Note that the police do not leave margins because they believe that X above the limit is safe. They do it because they will lose in court.

Average cameras are a bit interesting. They are actually more accurate than normal cameras but allow you a real 10% margin because being tied to the speedometer is not good for safety either. However I tend to stay beneath the marked limit. Also note that at one point the cameras on each lane were not linked up.

Either they were switched off, empty of any mechanism, were unable to take images or whatever and left there as scarecrows. Some could still flash but not take pictures. However it depends on the authority who is responsible for their up keep. They're quite expensive. Generally they're cash negative rather than positive I believe. It would make sense to assume that those authorities who do not maintain theirs very well would be most interested in maintaining the safety critical ones the most, ie outside of schools, near junctions and so on. Its a political point scorer. Also they're likely to be working in areas where people frequently speed. Its also worth noting that it isn't always a fixed thing going by experience. Some times one will work and sometimes it won't. 

2) The average GATSO camera system can analyse your speed 200 times as you approach and go through it, which is pretty incredible. They are really very accurate and the lines on the road you see in front of them are used to verify that  the speed was excessive using a simple speed, time, distance equation. We know the time between the photos and we can see the distance travelled. However until 33 mph its impossible to prove you knew you were speeding because VCUR compliant speeedos (any vehicle you buy in the UK will be) are accurate to + or minus 10% its also worth noting that tyre pressure can affect accuracy too. The ACPO stance on this is that it should be 10% + 2mph so to set one off on a 30 zone you would most likely be doing 35mph. Although I don't work with them I imagine that tolerance can be varied.

Westminster wants to hold the referendum earlier, much for the same reasons: support for the SNP has grown over time; and polls suggest growth of support for independence over time, but no poll I'm aware of yet has suggested an outright majority.

Both sides will sling mud at each other over the timing, but I'm pretty sure most of it is all bluster. It's not massively different to former Prime Ministers choosing when to schedule a general election.

* Taught English grammar from an early age
* Started a language in Primary school.

If he pays now he will still have the same record as if he challenges it in court and loses. So that doesn't make any sense. Secondly a Magistrate will most likely not fine any more than the value of the PND which he was issued. They might if they consider the abuse to be particularly bad but it is unlikely in most cases.

Well the record itself is both evidential and administrative and can be disclosed in court.  The officers statements are again, evidential and so is any seized CCTV. Going to court would have no assumption of guilt. This kind of case would be heard in front of a magistrate unless the defendant requests to go to crown court. In court the defendant will give his evidence, as will any other witness he brings along. They will be examined by the defence and then cross examined by the prosecution, the officers' evidence will be cross examined by the defence.

Equally, the coalition government is a prime example of this problem.  3/4 Lib Dems voters thought (rightly or not) they were voting for a Left wing party that would get rid of tuition fees, look seriously at scrapping planned Trident replacements, look after the NHS and so on.  That is not what they got.  (To be clear, the 3/4 figure is from the number of LD votes who now say they intend to abandon the party at the next election).

You rightly say that some people don't follow party lines, hence the UKIP and other parties recent successes.  But how many UKIP MPs do we have?  How many others?  Out of ~660 MPs we have one green and 2 others I think who are not big three party members.  So those who don't follow party lines clearly have little to no sway in actual government.

Actually, indigenous Britons (""British non-immigrants"") share around 80% of their genes with a handful of Ice Age hunters stretching back ***12,000 years*** (not hundreds). This means today's white Brits are far more closely related to the original inhabitants of these isles than they are to any of the ethnic groups you mention:

&gt;**British Have Changed Little Since Ice Age, Gene Study Says**

&gt;Despite invasions by Saxons, Romans, Vikings, Normans, and others, the genetic makeup of today's white Britons is much the same as it was 12,000 ago, a new book claims.

&gt;In The Tribes of Britain, archaeologist David Miles says around 80 percent of the genetic characteristics of most white Britons have been passed down from a few thousand Ice Age hunters.

I do think that the monarchy is a very big symbol of national identity and bring the advantage of making it very hard for anyone to be credible when pretending to represent patriotic ideas (no one can pretend to be more british/english than the monarchy).

It also provide a very reassuring figure to Britons, and I think that it is very beneficial for everyone to have this sentiment of stability and security.

I'm really kind of torn, leaning to republicanism, but seeing the Queen does care about the country and it's people.

You're contradicting yourself - by your logic British people are from all over the world and so shouldn't celebrate their Britishness, but you also say we should celebrate being European. I don't really see the conceptual difference between feeling British or European by your argument.

&gt; Secondly, the British non-immigrants, the people that have lived in the isles for hundreds of years, are not 100% descendants of the original inhabitants of the Isles - namely Britons and Celts.

true,PSBlake,null,null,"This is *probably* going to be the nerdiest thing I post today...

I thoroughly disagree with the assignment of characters to specific piece types, but not for the same reason you cited.

In the original game of chess, there is actually a thematic justification for the movements of the individual pieces: Orthogonal movement implied loyalty to the State, while diagonal movement implied loyalty to the Church.

* Royalty must be seen as serving the divine will, while also serving the affairs of state - but don't generally do both at the same time.
* Knights serve both their God and their King in equal measure.
* Bishops are only loyal to the Church.
* Rooks (Also known as Castles or even Marquess) are purely agents of the Crown.
* Pawns move at the command of their liege, but conquer in the name of their God.

In the Whoniverse, the natural divide would be Technology (Orthogonal movement) versus Nature (Diagonal movement). So:

* Weeping Angels should be Bishops: They are completely non-technological in nature.
* Cybermen should be Rooks: Their primary motivation is to suppress nature. (Arguably, Autons or even one of the many Android factions would make better Rooks, but Cybermen are more frequent adversaries)
* The Adipose shouldn't even be on the Doctor's side of the board, much less his pawns. Although not evil, they were the major threat in their only episode, and they aren't remotely technological in nature.
* The TARDIS makes more sense as a Pawn than a Rook: It moves at the command of Technology, but takes action by its own living will (nature). Having multiple instances of it on the board isn't terribly strange. Given the extent of the Doctor's travels and adventures, there's probably multiple instances of his TARDIS coexisting at any given moment.
* K9 would be ideally suited to being a Rook (purely technological), and having multiple instances of him shouldn't be too much of a problem: There have been [at least five of him](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/K9), after all.

I don't have a problem with the other pieces *per se*, but I feel like some UNIT soldiers might make more sense in place of Capt. Jack and ~~Capt. Jack~~ The Face of Boe.

true,[deleted],null,null,"How would Scotland survive? I can only assume this question is being asked because of the widely-held belief that Scottish public services are subsidised by English taxpayers.

This view is based on the discrepancy between levels of public spending per head of the population in Scotland and England. According to the Treasury's latest Public Expenditure Statistics, Scots gets an average of £10,212 spent on them every year by the UK government, compared with around £8,588 -- £1,624 less -- for people in England.

This so-called ""Union dividend"" is used by many London-based journalists and politicians  who argue that current levels of public expenditure in Scotland would be unsustainable were it to break away and become an independent country. 

Yet, if people took the time to examine the figures a little more closely, they would find that not only does Scotland more than pay its way in the Union, but its overall fiscal position would actually be stronger as a fully sovereign nation. 
 
Let's tackle the subsidy charge first. Scots represent 8.4 per cent of the UK's total population, but they generate 9.4 per cent of its annual revenues in tax -- equivalent to £1,000 extra per person. The remaining £624 is easily accounted for by decades of UK government under-spending in Scotland on defence and on other items which are not routinely broken down by region, such as foreign office services. 
 
Second, there's the claim that Scotland's ""bloated"" welfare state could not be sustained outside the Union. This is nonsense. Including its per capita share of revenues from North Sea oil and gas production, Scotland's public expenditure probably does not exceed the OECD average and is almost certainly lower than that of the Scandinavian social democracies. The fact that the Treasury cynically refuses to class those revenues as part of Scotland's overall annual economic output inflates the level of public sector expenditure as a proportion of GDP relative to that of the private sector.

Finally, one of the most common -- and least well-considered -- claims made by supporters of the Union is that the 2008 global financial meltdown shattered the economic case for independence. How, they argue, would the economy of tiny, independent Scotland have been able to cope with the burden of debt needed to rescue its financial sector from collapse? It wouldn't, of course, but according to George Walker, professor of financial regulation and policy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland would only have had to take on a proportion of the total cost of the bail-out based on the subsidiaries and business operations of HBOS and RBS in Scotland. This would probably amount to no more than 5 per cent. 

For the sake of argument, nationalists might also wish to note that Scotland's 2009 - 2010 deficit was, at 6.8 per cent of GDP, a full 3 per cent lower than England's, and that the likely defence expenditure of an independent Scotland would, at around $1.8bn per year in line with Nordic average, be roughly £1bn less than what the UK currently spends on its behalf. 

But why should Unionists let the economic facts ruin the image they have built up of Scotland as a nation of selfish, indulged welfare ""mendicants""?

There is at least movement: gaining new manufacturing with the push for renewables is pretty exciting, for example.

Regarding actual numbers, the information you want is detailed in the expenditure and revenue report, which is basically the best snapshot that Whitehall has: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS

It seems to generally be the case that Scotland spends more than it generates if you ignore oil, and spends less than it generates if you count the oil. I see the oil argument as a horrible and short-termist, but it's possibly a useful transitional crutch if managed well. (Of course, there's the possibility of lots of fossil fuel to the west of Shetland. So perhaps it's a long-term crutch, possibly giving Salmond the Norway-style oil fund he wants.)

It is true that more is spent per-head in Scotland than in England. I think spending here is in line with Wales and Northern Ireland.

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; we won't use open source whilst there is a proprietry software lobby. Fuck lobbying.

Well actually, proprietary software is more often the answer for these types of applications. Proprietary software comes with a support contract, which is in general worth much more than the software itself. On such a wide deployment as the public sector, you need to ensure you have a proper support contract that will modify the program to do what you need / fix bugs promptly.

With open source you get zero guarantees, zero culpability. You need a security team to review patches for backdoors (what happens if a backdoor in openoffice allows access to the NHS internal network?), you need a team to develop the extra features you need, etc etc.

Corporate culpability (i.e. someone to sue) is a large factor in these deployments. People would prefer to pay.

true,vitaminbillwebb,troughton,Troughton,"Untrue. First, calling the Ood--whose chief characteristic is that they have their brains in their hands--powerful seems to me to be a mistake. Do they have a stable civilization? Yes. Do they exercise power over one another? Nothing in the show suggests that this is the case.

Humans are great. They're scrappy survivors. When the odds are against them, they survive and create beautiful things the Doctor loves. But when they take power for themselves, they're the Toclaphane or the terrifying passengers on the train from ""Midnight"" or the murderous miners who kill the Fifth Doctor. 

Churchill's a nice point, though. But I would say that the episode in question actually makes my point, not yours. The Doctor likes Churchill--and I don't think I ever suggested that he didn't like some powerful people--but he doesn't trust him. This is established seconds after our meeting him when the Doctor refuses him the TARDIS key. Moreover, the plot of the whole episode revolves around the Doctor insisting that the UK needs to remain scrappy underdogs against the powerful, authoritarian Nazis. Seizing power by using the Daleks is wrong. Fighting, enduring, and surviving are good. 

Cleopatra's just a name-drop, isn't she? I mean, even when the Doctor meets Queen Elizabeth in the future, they have to make her a freedom fighter for her to be on the Doctor's side. She's queen, but she's opposed to authority. And River? The Doctor saves her life by changing her from a violent tool of the Silence into an archeologist and finally, a prisoner. Is River savvy? Sexy? Smart? Scrappy? Yes. Powerful? Not anymore. She gave that up. That's what made her a ""good guy."" 

And yes, the Doctor does leave the status quo alone. But that doesn't mean he doesn't ""delight in upsetting the status quo."" Consider ""The Romans,"" where, I'm told, he seems pretty happy to torch Rome. Or, more recently, ""Planet of the Ood"" or the whole Torchwood arc or any episode with the Daleks. Even the execrable ""Daleks in Manhattan"" makes the Daleks into unscrupulous bosses. Edit for clarity: The Doctor may not always upset the status quo, but he loves doing it when he can. 

As for ""loving the powerful,"" there may be specific powerful people whom the Doctor likes, but he likes them because of something else. Victoria's bad because she is the ultimate symbol of the British Empire. Elizabeth I is okay because her reign is one in which the culture of England flourished. Of course, her reign is also the one that started a long process of Empire-building, starting with the violent colonization of the Americas, but the Doctor likes the cultural baby of the Elizabethan era enough not to throw it out with the bathwater. Again, Churchill is the Doctor's friend, but he doesn't trust him. I'd say the same is probably true of anyone in power throughout the show, perhaps even the Brigadier.

Success:

It is to early to tell whether Dalglish will be successful - trophy vise. However he has been successful in completely turning things around. If we had beaten city, we'd be 8 points behind the first place. IMO we were missing our 3/5 best players (Gerrard, Lucas and Suarez), arguably our 3 most important players. We still have a good shot at the FA cup, Carling cup and a CL finish (3 points behind Chelsea is not that far today). To add on that I don't think the table is displaying how Liverpool been performing this season, I think for most parts we have out performed Chelsea and Arsenal.

Performance:

For the first time in what 10 or 15 years I can actually say that I'd enjoy watching Liverpool play if I was a neutral supporter. I can't remember a win this season we didn't deserve. I can only remember two games where we didn't deserve a win  (Spurs and last City match). When we compete against the lower end teams, yes we are dropping points, but for example during Benitez's tenure there were so many games we came out with more than we deserved and to be frank too many games we deserved nothing from. In the end the points count, but I'm confident that the average points per game will only increase with Dalglish at the helm, at least if the team keeps on playing like they are currently playing.

Transfers:

The transfers climate is changing rapidly. Right now, whether we like it or not, we needed homegrown(British) players. Homegrown status has never been this important, before Dalglish we had only three reliable English players (Carra, Gerrard and Johnson) now they are at least 5 (Gerrard, Downing, Henderson, Johnson and Kelly) and there are several other players that are homegrown that are atleast decent squad players (Shelvey, Bellamy, Carroll, Spearing and Carragher). Also Enrique, Bellamy, Henderson and Suarez have all been fantastic signings IMO. All of the players Dalglish has signed apart from Bellamy have the ability to play at this level in 5 years time.

Dalglish has also been excellent in optaining the best out of so many players: Skrtel and Spearing for example.

Have a good day :)
