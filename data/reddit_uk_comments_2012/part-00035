true,DirtySeverus,null,null,"Yeah… Maybe I should just stay out of politics, it really depresses me.
I was into spirituality and I stopped watching the news for about a year but then some of my spiritual friends and people on facebook kept going on about stuff.
I believe in reincarnation and alternate realities so I guess I am in this messed up world to test my integrity.

There were amino acids and single celled organisms for thousands of years and then BAM! More complex organisms.
Maybe humanity will be like that, brain dead sheep for thousands of years then BAM! Enlightened, evolved, loving, intuitive beings.
Well I know it is not that simple but there will be a certain point were the balance will tip in fovour of enlightenment rather than egotistical self interest.   

When I see that we are destroying rainforests and with it organisms that we don’t even understand for money, something we made up. I feel like I am in a heard of buffalo charging over a cliff but I just have to keep running with them even though I can see our own destruction. 
I had REALLY bad parents and it was shocking to find out that I was a better human being then them at around the age of 8, I grew up believing that grown ups went insane and if I was not carful I would too.
Now at the age of 24 I don’t think I was that wrong, I know our country is not that bad but that is only because it is built on the exploitation of others.
I understand if you think this is horseshit but I believe that the reality that we experience is a reflection of our state of mind.
Everyone is discontented and we are stuck in a vicious circle.
I saw a quote a while ago that inspired me that I need to live by (I am not right now) it was “The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.”

Even if I “play along” with the world I will always know in my heart that humanity is so much better than this bureaucracy that is a cancer on the human psyche.
I have no problem with your stance on things loudribs, what really irks me are the people who actively think that what we are doing is the only way forward.
I just can’t comprehend such madness, we all know on some level that this is wrong, it manifests itself as illness, depression, hating those different to you or even just being a nasty unlovable tool.
“It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”
I have rethought my own stance on things, I just want to enjoy my life but I remember as a child I was so angry that no one had done enough to make things better.
If I don’t try to make the world a better place, present and future children will hate me for my complacency.

Oh and as for solutions to our problems, I think that being a politician should be like jury service, as long as you pass certain tests that determine that you are a decent human being.
I am to blame too though, when I think of how messed up the world is I feel so much negativity in my heart.
It is my belief that when the joy that we feel in our heart outweighs the pain that we feel, we will be ok.

I am glad I remind you of yourself, I am a big believer in synchronicities.

3. Use the filters on the left to actually pick the correct category (you need to filter down to digital cameras, if you just use the search then results such as *""TunaTwist's autobiography: Digital Cameras and other Juicy Lemons""* will turn up in your results)
4. Set a price range
5. Click the ""4 stars and up"" button
5. Order by customer review / rating

Now you have a list of cameras in your price range sorted by how well reviewed they were. Make sure you check **how many reviews** they have though, if there's one review of 5 stars then it may well be at the very top but be complete shit.

Even after entering your requirements there are 222 to chose from, so add some filters based on what you think you'll use it for and read the reviews to make sure they don't say things like ""has a battery life of a dead fish"".

Obviously now you can add more filters if you know of a specific brand you want or need a certain amount of megapixels, zoom, blah blah blah. Each filter just reduces the amount of choice you have.

Employment, Fuel use and Shipping costs are all near instant both in their availability and their measurement of the strength of the economy.

So if GDP fell last quater it will fall this and next quarter.  But if employment goes up (which is hasn't), or fuel use or international shipping prices rise then there is recovery on the ground.

Court is completely open, meaning that anybody can go and sit in on the proceedings. I fail to see how the broadcasting of the case would make much difference in this respect. Court reporting by journalists has A LOT of restrictions on it, and I would assume that any broadcast would have similar if not more restrictions on it to guarantee the right to a fair trial and to protect the integrity of the court.

There are also several options open to witnesses that are afraid to testify that can restrict the reporting of these witnesses under the Contempt of Court Act, granting them permanent anonymity. These would operate in the same way for a TV broadcast.

And your point about people discussing why an innocent person ""should"" have been found guilty or why a guilty person ""shouldn't"" have got off, discussion like this would be considered *highly* defamatory to the accused, and while reports of court proceedings are protected from defamation action, any discussion such as this afterwards would leave the media wide open to huge defamation lawsuits.

However none of this is applicable as of yet because it will only be the sentencing being televised.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;How does this study relate to GP-led consortia? It doesn't. Citing a study on a similar topic just doesn't cut it, and I'd expect anyone involved in research to know that. In fact, it is outright misleading.

There is evidence from previous forms of GP commissioning. GP fundholders in the 1990s held a real budget to purchase community, outpatient and elective care for their patients. GP commissioners were not able to check rising expenditure on acute care (Smith, Curry, Mays and Dixon,2010. Where Next for Commissioning in the English NHS? London: Nuffield Trust and The King’s Fund.) or reshape hospital services significantly (Smith JA, Mays N, Dixon J, Goodwin N, Lewis R, McClelland S, McLeod H, Wyke S, 2004. A Review of the Effectiveness of Primary Care-led Commissioning and its Place in the UK NHS. London: The Health Foundation). This is important because demand for acute services continues to rise, in a time of economic austerity, and there is currently a need to reconfigure many services to deliver improvements in outcomes (Palmer, 2011. Reconfiguring Hospital Services. London: The Kings Fund).

Practice-based commissioning (PBC) was introduced in 2005, giving GP practices 'indicative' budgets with which to 'buy' health services for their population.  **GPs noted that they had a limited amount of time to engage in PBC, and in many cases also lacked the requisite skills, for example in data analysis**. The level of support they required from PCTs was therefore substantial (Curry, Goodwin, Naylor, Robertson, 2008. Practice-based Commissioning: Reinvigorate, replace or abandon? London: The Kings Fund). Small groups of highly motivated GPs led the scheme in most areas, but relationships with local hospital trusts were difficult, and wider service redesign proved difficult (Checkland, Coleman, Harrison, Hiroeh, 2008. Practice Based Commissioning in the National Health Service: Interim Report of a Qualitative Study. Manchester: University of Manchester).

Forms of GP commissioning have also been used internationally, including in the United States. There are several relevant lessons from this experience for the NHS: fundholding by physicians can involve high transaction costs and result in **major crises** if funds run out of before the financial year ends; groups should be accountable for quality and patient experience, not just cost. GP consortia will need high-calibre management and analytical support, as they are not used to acting as large conglomerates, handling millions of pounds (Nuffield Trust, 2011. Health and Social Care Bill - Second reading: Parliamentary Briefing).

The power to determine the services that make up the NHS will be transferred from the Secretary of State to newly created Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which are unelected. Members will include GPs but also **company chief executives** who can, if they wish, outsource decisions about the appropriate level of services offered to companies with commercial interests.

The GPs are being set up to fail.  They clearly, as evidenced before, lack the expertise to carry out the gargantuan tasks these commissioning bodies require.  It is likely that few will be able to show the necessary competence in the highly technical business of buying health care. Instead, the Bill allows CCGs to contract out commissioning functions to **private accountancy, health insurance and management consultant firms, which will be able to decide what care is provided free at the point of use through the NHS and what is not**. This means that profit-making companies will be able to provide your clinical care and also decide what you’re entitled to under the NHS and from which care providers. Companies will also design and set the care targets that doctors must meet. There is the strong potential for commercial conflicts when the needs of shareholders come between doctors and patients.

Guardiola is an odd one. He grew up with, played for, and then managed Barcelona. He was there while La Masia was being set up, and the transition into the hotseat simply meant he could learn the ropes, whilst having one of the most talented squads in the history of football under his tutelage. Titles galore, champions league, Euro Cup, WOrld Cup - half his squad have been there and done it. I'm not saying he *isn't* a great manager, but lets be honest, you could put pretty much any half decent manager in charge of that squad and they'd do well. 

Question is, would he have the same success at Chelsea whereby the setup is very, very, very different?

In one-shots like he did under RTD (Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, Silence of the Library) he does spectacularly. But when you give him too much slack he hangs himself with a muddled and incoherent overarcing plot.

We still don't have a solid reason *why* the TARDIS blew up or how, we have no clue *who* the Silents are or *what* they want. He'll take ideas and use them one way (in the Eleventh Hour the cracks act as portals linking two places in space and time) and then turn around and change it to fit the story (now the cracks erase people from existence). 

It gets worse when he shapes the characters to fit the plots as well, by having River suddenly all Missus Flirty among other things that twist the characters to fit the story rather than vice versa.

Brilliant minds are best when balanced by others (see the massive amount of intervention between George Lucas and the Original Trilogy by other artists) and when they're given *carte blanche* they'll usually bugger things up because no one's there to balance them out and say ""this isn't the greatest idea in the world"" (see the travesty that was the prequel trilogy).

&gt; I think the ruling is an overreaction.

Why?

&gt; the ASA still didn't think that was acceptable

And they explained why.

&gt; these guys never made a claim about curing cancer

The first paragraph of the [assessment section](http://asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/2/Healing-on-the-Streets_Bath/SHP_ADJ_158433.aspx) mentioned that the website had testimonials on cancer having been cured:

&gt; ...a video on the website also made claims that HOTS volunteers had successfully prayed for healing for people with cancer [and other ailments]. We noted the testimonials on the website and in the video but considered that testimonials were insufficient as evidence for claims of healing. We therefore concluded the ads were misleading.

But of course I'm not arguing that they've broken the Cancer Act, but simply pointing out that there is a restriction on free speech that has been there for over 70 years with, I don't think, too many complaints about it nor has it caused anyone harm either that I know of. A good thing too, seeing as that's one of the reasons it was implemented in the first place.

&gt; they are not claiming they can cure anyone, but that God can.

That's a complete cop out, if you don't mind me saying: ""Hey, don't blame us that you didn't get cured - Talk to the guy upstairs!"" That's like me trying to get out of the fact that the Imp in my magic healing box hasn't cured someone as implied by saying: ""Hey it's nothing to do with me - Talk to the little fella in there!""    
They claim that by *their* actions, someone will be healed.

&gt; Personally I don't think it should be illegal to claim that I; can fly, blow bubbles out of my ears or regard the Guardian as a decent newspaper.

Good job it's not illegal then (though I can't comment on the bubbles thing if it were in an ad)! But you try and take out a full page ad in the Guardian saying that your god has given you special powers of healing and you can cure cancer by laying your hand on someone's head: ""I will act as a conduit for my god and it will heal you."" Do you understand why there are restrictions in place to avoid that?

&gt; I don't think so.

Righto, must have been someone else.

&gt; it's a shame we aren't discussing the possible free-speech implications of the case

Because there aren't any? Certainly none that would lead to harm coming to vulnerable people, which is precisely what could (and does) occur if such restrictions are not in place.

&gt; he regularly criticises Christianity in a blog about science.

So? Perhaps some Christians keep saying silly things about science.

&gt; some good old religion and MP bashing

MP: Do you not agree that these three are morons? One would have assumed they'd know what the scientific method involves before sending out such a letter.

Religion: I don't see it? Definitely not in this thread. Can you point out an overtly religion bashing comment? I've just scanned through them and can't see one.

But on the subject of religion bashing: you might be interested to hear what [Hayley Stephens has had to say about HOTS back in February](http://hayleyisaghost.co.uk/healing-on-the-streets-why-i-am-not-a-group-generally-opposed-to-christianity/) - She was the woman that complained to the ASA about HOTS Bath in the first place.

Bad Wolf mystery: Just a difference of opinion. I found it to be essentially inconsequential and if you removed it I never would have noticed anything out of place in any of the episodes(except where Rose explains that they saw it everywhere). I didn't get that sense of mystery, but, again, just preference.

Cracks: I'll spot you that the change from Eleventh Hour to the rest of the season was most likely just incongruity(I could try to explain it away, but that's just random guessing). The finality doesn't bug me, since it continues to the next season and I'm not married to single season plot arcs.

Pandorica: My guess for the Pandorica is that the Doctor built it in 1969, but just a guess. I assume time will tell. I also don't know the reason behind imprisoning vs. killing, and it may be a plot weakness, but I suspect there is an actual reason behind it.

River: Still disagree. Hasn't changed much, beyond her getting younger.

TARDIS exploding: Was resolved. It didn't explode. Well it did, but it didn't. The reboot of the universe was a godsend in my book. It let Moffat undo a ton of horrible things and let the Doctor go back to being the Doctor and not the guy Earth relies on to fix everything all the time(i.e. not Superman). The question of why it had exploded in the first place was carried into the next season with the Silence. It's still unresolved.

Basically, I feel Moffat is better than RTD (or if I'm more accurate, Lesser of the Two Evils). I'm not really saying Moffat is perfect. I'm saying Davies is crap(er). But if we are all totally honest, we could ALL find plot holes and other holes in practically anything any writer does.

RTD's Bad wolf? To get to the bottom line, all that was was just a crappy little set of two words that RTD and other writers just popped into the stories in some shape or form. From our point of view, sure there was a bit of a mystery in it but all the writers had to do was just to stick them into their scripts somehow and maybe, if they want to be clever, expand it into a few more lines to cover it up. Then at the end, it was explained quickly in a single scene. Similar things with some of his other ones.

As compared with Moffs where he has answered a few questions in a season...but kept up interested with a whole lot more.

Personally, I wouldn't mind it if Moffat doesn't answer all the questions in one series...or even 3. It keeps me interested and into it apart from anything else. Having said that..I do for sure want him to answer it all before he leave and another new arc set starts up. 

One thing I did like about the RTD era (and this is more about the era than the show runner) is that it had a more science fiction feel to it. I prefer all the sciencey explanations to things rather than things like ""love"" constantly solving the day. I'd like DW to stay well out of the fantasy realm.

I still think we need a show that makes people think about it though. There are FAR too many crappy shows out there that are aimed at families that just treat the kids like utter morons (which I have to admit...when talking to adults, I can't blame them for sometimes).

true,fred1878,english,Kent,"I agree with you on both your points, however I would like to point out that cannabis has actually been shown to induce mental health issues:

'There is growing evidence that people with serious mental illness, including depression and psychosis, are more likely to use cannabis or have used it for long periods of time in the past.  Regular use of the drug has appeared to double the risk of developing a psychotic episode or long-term schizophrenia. However, does cannabis cause depression and schizophrenia or do people with these disorders use it as a medication?

 

Over the past few years, research has strongly suggested that there is a clear link between early cannabis use and later mental health problems in those with a genetic vulnerability - and that there is a particular issue with the use of cannabis by adolescents.

 


A study following 1600 Australian school-children, aged 14 to 15 for seven years, found that while children who use cannabis regularly have a significantly higher risk of depression, the opposite was not the case - children who already suffered from depression were not more likely than anyone else to use cannabis. However, adolescents who used cannabis daily were five times more likely to develop depression and anxiety in later life.

 


Three major studies followed large numbers of people over several years, and showed that those people who use cannabis have a higher than average risk of developing schizophrenia. If you start smoking it before the age of 15, you are 4 times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder by the time you are 26. They found no evidence of self-medication. It seemed that, the more cannabis someone used, the more likely they were to develop symptoms.

 

Why should teenagers be particularly vulnerable to the use of cannabis? No one knows for certain, but it may be something to do with brain development. The brain is still developing in the teenage years – up to the age of around 20, in fact. A massive process of ‘neural pruning’ is going on. This is rather like streamlining a tangled jumble of circuits so they can work more effectively. Any experience, or substance, that affects this process has the potential to produce long-term psychological effects.

 

Recent research in Europe, and in the UK, has suggested that people who have a family background of mental illness – and so probably have a genetic vulnerability anyway - are more likely to develop schizophrenia if they use cannabis as well.'

It's not just a ""I'm so scary!"" speech, it was specifically playing on the fact that none of the aliens in the faction above him actually liked or trusted each other.

Like in the Craig episodes, where he'll make the most totally boneheaded aspie blunders, and then break out with some mind-bending bit of psychology that totally stuns the humans around him.

I actually am starting to see him as being pretty devious and manipulative, made worse by his willingness to openly deceive and lie to his friends while relying on his ""geek chic"" to make them keep loving him.  (See: The Girl Who Waited)  If they started taking him more in that direction, I think it would make him quite a bit more interesting.

I appreciate your efforts!

&gt; Why?

quite simple really. I think people of any/all/no faith should be able to produce leaflets expressing their views. This would apply to any crazy claims or beliefs, as long as they were not for financial motive, or inciting violence. 

In my opinion the ASA leaves common sense behind, and treats this small religious group as if they are a global for-profit conglomerate printing an full page ad in the newspaper trying to get money off people. In reality they are a small religious group wanting to pray for people in their community. 

&gt; They claim that by their actions, someone will be healed.

no, they said by their actions, God *may* heal them or they *may* be healed. there were no guarantees - the leaflets are carefully worded as possibilities, not sure things. 

&gt; But you try and take out a full page ad in the Guardian saying that your god has given you special powers of healing and you can cure cancer by laying your hand on someone's head: ""I will act as a conduit for my god and it will heal you."" Do you understand why there are restrictions in place to avoid that?

if it was for a paid service or product, yes. If some nutball wants to print craziness and he has the money, no problem. 

of course HOTS didn't take an ad out in a national newspaper. they handed out leaflets in a street. 

&gt; Because there aren't any? Certainly none that would lead to harm coming to vulnerable people, which is precisely what could (and does) occur if such restrictions are not in place.

I would be interested in seeing a case in which harm came to anyone as a result of receiving a leaflet in the street claiming god can heal them. The free speech danger here is that people are restricted from expressing a religious or spiritual belief because of a hypothetical situation in which someone may 'get their hopes up' or stop taking medication. As far as I know there is no evidence in this case of this happening. It's purely conjecture, and yet the free speech of an entire group has been limited based on this. 

The only saving grace in this whole sorry scenario is that, as I'm aware, the ASA does not have any legal clout to bring charges or legally prohibit the group from carrying on regardless. It is really up to HOTS discretion as to whether to continue handing out the leaflets - they are under no legal obligation to stop. (it seems they are doing/making changes and being as flexible/accommodating as possible). 

The ASA can advise the police to bring criminal charges, but they would probably not like to take it that far. ",0,1332955803,null,0,false,0,c45x5bu,t3_rhdyv,t1_c45x5bu,t1_c45wa2j,null,1435726392,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Main reason I'm replying, since we're sort of at a standstill on most points: The reboot can be a huge cop-out, but it also has a huge strength. Most shows/movie series/book series/comic series suffer from baggage accumulation as they age. Given a long enough time-line, the weight of that baggage will suffocate most potential new ideas. Reboots shed that baggage and let the show breath again. I found that to be true here. Case in point: Without the reboot, having the Doctor land in modern day London should result in everyone passing by greeting him by name and thanking him for acting as a tow-truck to put their planet back in orbit.

[](/s ""Little River then dies in New York City. We again have literally no explanation for why this happens. She becomes Mel as a toddler and is at some point (Again, we have no clue to the how or why) brought over to London where she grows up with her mum and dad."")

I think that positive discrimination isn't always up against 'what if the best people for the job were all white' - sometimes, just bringing some difference can be beneficial to the job. A black person in a white-dominated workplace, for instance, can provide a different perspective *especially* in something like comedy and current affairs. Being different can be what makes them good for a job, just as if they were the same as the others, it could be a hindrance.

Sure, you can be represented by and laugh at/with people who aren't the same as you, but I think the variety is nice and it's nice to have people with different experiences be there to provide their opinion.

It's also the case that our society is a long way from equally-representative and a long way from being blind to all but talent. Perhaps if we give minorities a boost now, it will make things nicer, sooner.

River absorbed energies (hu-an? like the kind Donna was exposed to at the start of season 3, I think) We only know that Madame K works for, or is manipulated by the Silence, but so what? we don't know that much about the silence yet either. River Killing the Doctor is a fixed point because they THINK the Doctor is dead, hence, they stop trying to kill him. at least for now ;) 

Little River escaped from her captors and the space suit. The details of how she ended up in DC and Florida are still to be told, but when she escaped the silence she escaped their influence but still knew of them and their foul plans so of course she's going to try to warn someone. 

They DO explain how little River dies, but not specifically. she is wandering the streets alone, hungry, and tired. How she made it to London? The details have yet to be told to us but It's easy to assume she knew that's where Mum and Dad live so she felt the need to go there somehow. 

During the scenes when she is a child getting in trouble for talking about how the Doctor ""let"" bad things in history happen is part of why she wanted to kill Hitler. The other is simply because he is Hitler, kinda self explanatory. She was armed, because she stole a car and needed something to help ...persuade the Doctor to take her back in time. She becomes armed again when her mental programing/brainwashing kicks in. (Hello Benjamin)

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; I think people of any/all/no faith should be able to produce leaflets expressing their views.

What if that results in harm to an individual? Proven harm that can be traced directly back to the claims of a group like HOTS?

&gt; trying to get money off people

Personally I find claims to heal based on no evidence at all to be as distasteful, perhaps more so, than fraudulent activities for financial game - though very often the two go hand in hand.

&gt; In reality they are a small religious group wanting to pray for people in their community.

Hayley Stephens is/was a member of that community and a few years ago was very ill herself. She recognised that the claims this group were making could have lead her to seek their 'help' rather than proper legitimate medical treatment and in doing so could have caused her death. I'm not being grandiose - she was very ill.

&gt; no, they said by their actions, God may heal them or they may be healed. there were no guarantees - the leaflets are carefully worded as possibilities, not sure things.

You said you've read the leaflet and website? I don't understand where you're getting this ""carefully worded ...possibilities"" part from, except perhaps going down the avenue that one suffers with a pedantic teacher in early school life:

Pupil: ""Miss, can I got to the toilet?""    
Teacher: ""I'm sure you can.""    
Pupil: ""... Miss, *may* I go to the toilet?""    
Teacher: ""Yes, you may.""

The wording on the leaflet was quoted by the ASA, but [here's the leaflet too](http://hayleyisaghost.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bath-healing-leaflet.jpg). I'll quote it:

&gt;  ""NEED HEALING? GOD CAN HEAL TODAY! Do you suffer from Back Pain, Arthritis, MS, Addiction ... Ulcers, Depression, Allergies, Fibromyalgia, Asthma, Paralysis, Crippling Disease, Phobias, Sleeping disorders or any other sickness? We'd love to pray for your healing right now! We're Christian from churches in Bath and we pray in the name of Jesus. We believe that God loves you and can heal you from any sickness"".

""God **can** heal today!"" Yes, it's not ""God **will** heal today!"" so it would see that HOTS do have some degree of understanding about such claims. However, the implication of the leaflet, together with the testimonials on the website, could lead people to conclude that prayer *will* lead them to get better.

Are you aware of the damage that homoepathy has done on this front? [Here's a sample](http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html): 

&gt; ""Jacqueline Alderslade... Died (asthma attack) July 9, 2001    
A homeopath told her to give up her asthma medication. She later died of an asthma attack""

There are many more such examples, even when they homeopath urged the sick person to get medical help. Harmless? Or still should be protected by free speech?

&gt; If some nutball wants to print craziness and he has the money, no problem.

Are you actually serious? Rhetorical. I realise you are. But that doesn't mean I understand how you can fail to see the harm such things can cause. Is it just an individual group that can do something like this? I mean, are you against big business doing similar things? If so... again I don't understand how you can make the distinction between ""OK bullshit"" and ""Too far bullshit"" based simply on, it appears, what a group's motivation is.

I get the impression you're just looking for a loophole for religious activities.

&gt; I would be interested in seeing a case in which harm came to anyone as a result of receiving a leaflet in the street claiming god can heal them.

I've given you numerous, I think analogous, homeopathic examples above. Is it *specifically* the leaflet aspect that you're going to cite when it comes to people being put in danger from claims like this? [If you've ever heard of Peter Popoff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BQKu0YP8Y), you'll understand why I don't think such claims should be tolerated. True, Popoff is different to the case here - but I'm pointing out the people who are throwing their medication up on stage thinking they no longer need them.

&gt; As far as I know there is no evidence in this case of this happening.

I'm not sure I would be happy to wait until it did occur.

&gt; It's purely conjecture, and yet the free speech of an entire group has been limited based on this.

If that was entirely the case (I'm not sure it is): What effect has this had upon them? In what way are their daily lives and beliefs being restricted? They can still practice their religion. True, their ministry might be affected to a degree but they're still free to worship etc.

&gt; What if that results in harm to an individual? Proven harm that can be traced directly back to the claims of a group like HOTS?

then the group or individuals responsible should be charged with something. but only *after* you have evidence of harm, and can trace that harm to HOTS. 

&gt; Personally I find claims to heal based on no evidence at all to be as distasteful, perhaps more so, than fraudulent activities for financial game - though very often the two go hand in hand.

that may be true, and it is your right to consider them distasteful. But distasteful is not, in my opinion, a legitimate reason to stop someone expressing a belief. (unless it goes from being distasteful to being harmful/violent). 

&gt; She recognised that the claims this group were making could have lead her to seek their 'help' rather than proper legitimate medical treatment 

This is my main issue with the whole thing. the entire case is based on a hypotheticals. 

Do I think an devout atheist could have been led to seek the help of a prayer group? I find it unlikely, but ok maybe she would have. The important thing is *she never did*. 

Secondly, do I think it is likely she would have sought their help *rather* than go to the doctors? no way. I doubt anyone would do this, much less someone who clearly dislikes/distrusts such a group. Furthermore we have no evidence that HOTS ever told *anyone* not to go to the doctors - in fact we have evidence they offerred to include (in their documentation) a clear instruction to still go to the doctors which was rejected (!?). 

&gt; and in doing so could have caused her death

woah. talk about taking a hypothetical all the way through to an extreme. I'm sure you get my point by now. A group is being held responsible for a hypothetical situation which never took place - in the extreme being charged as though their actions could have led to someones death. 

&gt; However, the implication of the leaflet, together with the testimonials on the website, could lead people to conclude that prayer will lead them to get better.

I would say *could* lead them to get better. and it is their right to express this belief. 

&gt; There are many more such examples, even when they homeopath urged the sick person to get medical help. Harmless?

I'm sure I don't need to explain how the crazy actions of a homeopath have anything to do with HOTS. unless you have evidence HOTS ever behaved in a similar way. 

&gt; I mean, are you against big business doing similar things?

can you give an example? Big businesses constantly advertise things I don't like, I think a lot of them make unfounded claims and dangerous implications (fast food/loans/banks etc). But if they want to express a message, they can and should be allowed to do so. 

&gt; I don't understand how you can make the distinction between ""OK bullshit"" and ""Too far bullshit"" based simply on, it appears, what a group's motivation is.

I think that is a great indicator. apparently it is ""OK bullshit"" for the conservatives or labour to make all kinds of crazy political half-truths to gain votes and political power.  but it is ""too far"" for a group of christians to express that they believe God can heal people, and want to pray for them? 

&gt; Is it specifically the leaflet aspect that you're going to cite when it comes to people being put in danger from claims like this?

no, not the leaflet, but I think it should be limited to this particular group. HOTS have done nothing I can see that caused harm to anyone. no one is claiming to have been a victim of harm. no one is claiming to have been offended or told to avoid the doctor or refrain from medicine. 

&gt; If you've ever heard of Peter Popoff, you'll understand why I don't think such claims should be tolerated.

I've heard of Popoff. But again, this guy is asking for money. HOTS are not. Popoff is making very specific, affirmative statements - ""send me $100, you'll get healed"". that isn't what HOTS are doing. 

&gt;  but I'm pointing out the people who are throwing their medication up on stage thinking they no longer need them.

ok, so in theory - would you be ok with HOTS if they had a very strict policy of clearly explaining how people should still go to the doctors and take their medication? because that seems to be your only issue. If you remove the possibility of physical harm by avoiding medical treatment - surely this is ok right? 

&gt; I'm not sure I would be happy to wait until it did occur.

well ok, but you do realise this is some minority report, 1984 thought crime type stuff? charging or inhibiting a person's freedom based on something that *might* happen in the future. no evidence. surely no harm no foul right? 

&gt; True, their ministry might be affected to a degree but they're still free to worship etc.

quite simply their freedom to do what they want is prohibited. If we flipped it around and this was an atheist group being prohibited from handing out ""God doesn't exist"" leaflets - would you still support the ASA banning their leaflets? Someone *could* be a devout believer, read the leaflet, become convinced God did not exist, become depressed, and commit suicide. That is comparable is it not? 

&gt; And the 'saving grace' is that ""It don't mean squat""? Awesome - So what are you worried about?

that we are on the slow zombie walk into gradually giving up freedom of speech and freedom of expression/religion. I'm worried that this is an indicator of where we are heading as society, and free thinking individuals should be fighting that, not cheerleading it.

Freedom of speech does not extend to situations where your words can be reasonably expected to bring about harm to others; that's why we have laws against defamation, conspiracy, and incitement.  This law about specific medical claims requiring supporting evidence is in the same vein, because making claims about the power of any treatment is obviously going to persuade a certain number of people to pursue that treatment *instead* of others.  By advocating faith healing, you will cause some people to be harmed because they forwent conventional medicine.  [**Children die because of faith healing**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8180116.stm).  I know that's largely an appeal to emotion, but this is the end result of what happens when false medical claims come to be believed.  
  
It's absolutely right that the ASA steps in an stops any person, organisation, or group from making such unsubstantiated medical claims.

My understanding is that even the solar system is so sparsly occupied with matter that if you take off in a random direction, you probably won't hit anything.

I'm assuming that the ship would be shielded against your standard small bits and pieces, but hitting something big would be ""bad"". I'm also assuming the rocket will just shoot off into the universe and not get trapped in a gravitational field, but even including that I think the chances are very low of getting captured by anything. 

To give an example of how low the chances may be, this article I found at wikipedia says that the [odds of a probe running into an asteroid in the asteroid belt are 1 in a billion](http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_Horizons_Crosses_The_Asteroid_Belt.html).

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Well DirtySeverus, my heart goes out to you. There's nothing worse than being angry, knowing why you're angry and also knowing there is very little you can do about it. If it's any consolation, it does get better with time and that's not to say that you wake up one morning and suddenly decide not to care, it's just the older you get, the more you come to see that there is very little that is truly black and white and that in actual fact, a lot of the beauty in the world resides within it's imperfections. That may sound strange right now but actually, all the good stuff is in the flaws.

An example perchance? Well for me a big moment was when I realised that most conspiracies are actually headless. When you look at the world, it's easy to conclude that a great deal of the evil around is the result of evil people... And to some extent is is. However, the more time you actually spend with actual, real evil (and I've spent a great deal of time amongst it) the more you come to realise that the bad stuff tends to reside *between* people, not *within* them (although there are people out there where it's truly personafide). That sounds weird but trust me, nine times out ten the bad stuff in this world is a confluence of motives, systems, happenstance and circumstance. I have very little love for our current government but I don't think there's a cackling clique of blackhearted warlocks, actively planning ill against everyone. Rather it's a set of people whose histories and backgrounds have suddenly fallen into line with unique circumstance creating an engine that drives itself and is ultimately beyond control. It's right to question these people and their actions but to obsess over them will only end with doing yourself a mischief (not that I'm suggesting that you are).

My advice? Find something to call your own, something you can control. For me, that has always been the likes of music and writing but it can be anything. Having that, that something where you are in charge of may just give you the mental latitude to peek beyond all the bad and hold on to some good. That doesn't mean giving up on trying to fix all the stuff that's wrong but it may result in being able to choose which fights to pick (rather than being consumed by all of them).

And as for the jury idea? I like it! It would mean a certain random amount of idiots in government and I have know idea how you'd get it to work without a minor civil war but I like the concept. Anyway, I've rambled enough and the Apprentice is own so I'm getting the hell out of here for now. Nice talking to you.

Stop focussing on Hayley. She is not the issue and not the reason she wrote to the ASA. The issue is the people who *wouldn't even consider* that the claims of HOTS were unsubstantiated. It's the ignorant and vulnerable people that Hayley was seeking to protect. This is not a difficult concept.

&gt; someone who clearly dislikes/distrusts such a group.

Read what Hayley has written about all this. Read it and realise that these claims have no evidence behind them. Oh my... that's just like something else I've been talking about recently.

&gt; Furthermore we have no evidence that HOTS ever told anyone not to go to the doctors

I didn't realise that that was the issue in the ruling. However, if you think you've been cured of something you're not going back to the Doc are you? In the same way you won't go back to HOTS. Pointless point, I feel.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"I wouldn't take it as you running off, I think you've shown more sand than anyone else in at least engaging in a conversation. I'm sorry you became offended at my devout atheist jibe - let me try and explain it.

in retrospect, devout *skeptic* may have better described Hayley (though she is an atheist also). 

she does a skeptic podcast, investigates the supernatural etc. my point was she is not an unaffiliated/unbiased individual - she has an interest in proving supernatural claims wrong - that's her whole deal. I'm not saying her complaint shouldn't be heard or isn't valid (and i'm not using atheist as an insult/derogatory term - that was not my intent at all and I'm sorry if that's how it came across) - but it is not a claim coming from someone who was harmed by HOTS or had any real experience with them apart from passing them in the street.

I will address some other points, obviously you don't have to respond. 

&gt; Charged with what exactly: Having and stating beliefs? That sounds almost like... restricting their freedom of speech and also their religion!

if they caused harm we could charge them with endangering life or something? I'm not a law expert, but I know that if some harm came to someone as a result of HOTS, it would be an easier case to make than one in which you accuse HOTS of *possibly*, *potentially* causing future harm to someone. 

&gt; Do you think that someone who thinks mentally disabled people are going to hell should be tolerated in their habits of going up to such disabled people and their families and giving them leaflets about how said disabled person is going to burn for eternity? If not, why not?

that sounds like harassment, which I think is illegal. I don't think you could describe HOTS as harassing anyone (not like those god-awful chuggers). 

as for this point and free-speech - someone can say they think disabled people are going to hell, they could even hand out leaflets. but if they targeted the disabled systematically that sounds like harassment/discrimination to me.

&gt; ""Officer, why are you writing me a ticket for not having an MOT? My car isn't falling apart and I haven't caused a crash. I don't understand.""

because it is *the law* to have a valid MOT. as far as I know it is not against the law to cause offence or be potentially responsible for causing/contributing to someone's *potential* harm.

&gt; She is not the issue and not the reason she wrote to the ASA. The issue is the people who wouldn't even consider that the claims of HOTS were unsubstantiated. It's the ignorant and vulnerable people that Hayley was seeking to protect. This is not a difficult concept.

but she was the only person who wrote to complain about HOTS. maybe her motivation was from a good place - as you say to protect the vulnerable. but that is still all based on imaginary, potential future damage, there is no evidence of such damage to vulnerable individuals by HOTS. that's why I think it's worrying. the ASA claims it is protecting the vulnerable and ignorant. You could argue they are stopping people from making their own minds up or hearing both sides. Its the slow creep of government intervention into the free exchange of ideas. 

&gt; However, if you think you've been cured of something you're not going back to the Doc are you? 

I would, to double check it.

up to you to find them, not me. 

&gt;If you can show me evidence that the ""FAR majority"" of cannabis users are in fact degenerates or that all of the evidence I have sourced to is wrong, then we can have a real discussion, but you can't back up your claims.

Cannabis by socio economic class: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18615935

Couldn't find the number of (non pot smoking crime related) criminals against pot smokers demographic, but lower SES have higher crime rates, so that statistic is already infered.

&gt;Nearly all request for access to cannabis plants are denied. 

Nearly. Not all.

&gt;Learn to use commas and we'll continue down this road.

Like when? Also, commas are at the writers discretion, and are used to separate clauses. A book with no commas can be grammatically correct. Also, spelling mistakes are accidental, you purposefully tried to look clever and failed at it.

&gt;Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.

Science says you can't ""make up"" new chromosomes in order to have a genetically different offspring. Either that, or we borrowed from another species or 'made up' genetic info which means we can't call her a true timelord. (must resist urge to use the term mudblood)

Once the word is out  that there will be a shortage, any individual who does *not* fill their tank is acting irrationally. 

This is pretty predictable. 

The shortage has been blatantly orchestrated by the Cameron and the other idiot who told people to fill jerrycans with gasoline (something the fire brigade is worried about, they've asked the minister to retract his suggestion, I wonder which service will be next on the list for privitisation?). 

Meanwhile, there is not yet a strike. The issue is supposed to be arbitrated by ACAS (I think that's the name of the arbitrating body and not the people who get you into university). If there is no strike planned, why fill up? Only because the government are stirring shit against workers with a grievance for their own gains and using the public as fodder in their stupid games. 

I'm going to assume the majority of people blame the workers for fighting for a better deal (and appropriate safety measures...) instead of the government who have invented a crisis where none aught to exist.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1332974448,null,0,false,0,c4615un,t3_ri9re,t1_c4615un,t3_ri9re,null,1428613010,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"The key thing is that she is someone who the Doctor can talk with and explain things to. This is indeed vital with getting key pieces of information off without having to use the old and lazy ""as you know..."" preface to everything.

I may not know specifically what I do want (almost anything would be good, if done properly), but there are a few things I *don't* want.

1. **No Relationships**
 - Ever since Rose we've been having these skinny twenty-somethings needing to have everything explained to them whilst they either pine for the Doctor or get muddled in their own relationships. This isn't great, especially when the relationships aren't well written. There's a reason that Donna (the sole exception to this in New Who) is often heralded as the best companion.

2. **No Doctor-Worship**
 - We don't need someone else fawning over the Doctor all the time. We know he's amazing and funny and brilliant and all that jazz. We do not need to have someone telling us this. Again, Donna is a prime example of having someone who admits the Doctor's swell, but doesn't obsess over it. A companion should be someone willing to kick the Doctor in place for a bit, bring him down to earth. This can be done in many different ways, but it certainly isn't done by stroking his ego like Rose, Martha, and Amy have.

3. **Not Dumb** 
 - Amy, Rose, Martha, all keep up with the Doctor in their own ways but the Doctor's never challenged by them, you never really feel they're his equals. More than anything I'd like to see the Doctor have a *partner* rather than an *assistant*. I hate to bring her up again, but in those last few seconds with Donna we were teased with a brilliant Doctor Donna to be the Doctor's equal.

That's about it. Go with any dynamic you want, father/daughter, mentor/apprentice, adventurer/tagalong, whatever. Just don't do any of those things I mentioned above.",0,1332974775,null,0,false,0,c461879,t3_ri6ic,t1_c461879,t3_ri6ic,null,1428613046,20,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,20

However, given how Figueroa struggled with Suarez against Liverpool, it would have been nice to still have him as an option.

Yeah I would have liked van Aanholt to get into a competition battle with him. He came fresh from the Chelsea Academie and even though Martinez had a very warm reception for him and gave him trust, something has gone wrong. I watched the games where he played and though it was not very strong, he didn't jump out as the bad one to me. Vitesse is a nice club with big ambitions and he does fine, but this case has puzzled me for some time. In his tweets van Aanholt himself said he also didn't understand it and that he was told no reasons. But let's just conclude he was not good enough at the time the Club needed more stability at the spot he had to occupy. He is still very young.

1. Not without Stephen Fry.
2. Would hope it wouldn't be 'dummed down'
3. Half hour episodes just wouldn't work. With commercials it'd end up being ~23 minutes. Take the QI XL approach, and it might work.
4. Put it on Comedy Central or another cable network. OTA Networks suck.

The one thing about the panelists that I sort of like, is that with 95% of them, I had never heard of them before I started watching QI. So I had no preconceived notions about who they all were. They were either funny, intelligent, or INTERESTING. I don't know if the QI panelists I'm used to watching are 'top-tier' stars or whatever, and because I'm not familiar with the UK market, it doesn't really matter. The one sure way to make a US version fail, would be to have a ""Dancing with the Stars"" type cast, full of a bunch of has-been's and losers who haven't done anything significant in 20 years. 

In conclusion, it COULD be ok, but why do it? It's perfect as is.

And as far as the Brit version running here, it'd be a problem with copywrights &amp; licensing. The BBC pays a certain fee to artists to broadcast images and music in Britain. The cost to show those images or play those songs would be MUCH higher in the US. If you watch any Top Gear UK episodes on BBA America, any songs have been changed to a generic, rock-sounding substitute for the same reason.",0,1332979188,null,0,false,0,c4623qd,t3_rcyut,t1_c4623qd,t3_rcyut,null,1428613516,3,false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,3

While she loves him in a kinda creepy bella sorta way, he kinda sees her as a fuck buddy. Also, she was willing to end time and everything just so she wouldn't have to kill the Doctor - But she would still be killing the Doctor and everyone else- 

The problem I have with the Ponds is The Doctor doesn't do demstication. 
Like, he constantly says that he wants to go on the slow path. The only path he can't travel. But he did. He was a dad and a grandpapa. The reason he doesn't do families is because it reminds him of what he took away from himself. What had to be done. And the Ponds are constant reminder of the happieness he once had and it pisses me off because He hates being reminded. 

Honestly that's probably why I dislike 11. The episode with House in the TARDIS. House is talking and says something along the lines ""I've killed dozens of Timelords."" 11 says ""I've killed them all."" with a kinda smerk on his face. I'm Just like ~WHAT THE HEELLLL~ ~ NOOO.~ because it's like he's bragging. Anyone that goes to war and actually kills people isn't going to brag about it. When someone askes them about it, they will slump they head and make up a reason why they can't talk about it. 

Also with 11 they are lots of monsters and less Aliens. Which also bothers me. It's a sci-fi not a fantasy. Amy, Rory, and The Doctor just run around, derping about, screaming Monster for 40 minutes and then with in the last 5 minutes they go ""LOLZ nope JK alien. Totes my goats Alien."" 

Rant Rant Rant, I could go onnnn. 


TL;DR I dislike the Ponds and 11 all together. 

Also if this didn't make sense and was just a mass of words -Keep calm and carry on- by that I mean ignore it.

You dislike 11 for the exact opposite reason I didn't like 10 in the end. 10 was so depressed about the Time War, he couldn't move on. He curled up when the Time War memories became prevalent. It was sad, and then it got old. For the Doctor, a Time Lord who can live for almost ever, if he can't move on from the mistakes of his past, he'll have a very long depressing life. That's not the Doctor. The Doctor flies in, stops evil, quite a few people die in the process and he flies off in his TARDIS to another adventure with little thought about the consequences of what he's just done (right or wrong). I have always said that 11 has accepted what he's done in the Time War. 11 has moved on and is no longer letting what he's done weigh on his shoulders. It was the character coming to reality and no longer letting what happened at some point in his life (at least 9 years before that episode takes place and now 200+ years before the current Doctor) rule him. People do terrible things in war. But for a character who is supposed to be a hero (to the audience) and immortal, it would be weird to see the Doctor upset by an event that happened in his life, even one has big as committing double genocide.

Me taking a 'lot of the creativity out of the system' is an interesting claim that I doubt can be backed up. The current state of affairs is that we are gravitating towards an incumbent hegemony of publishers, and of course behind that is the even bigger monopoly in Google. I see the internet having been lost when adsense came along.

I think this is categorically false. The biggest companies can have full divisions devoted to ad generation and selling. 

&gt; Many internet startups would never get off the ground if you took away all the adverts, and instead we'd end up with a few large and main websites taking all the visitors.

I think this would not be the case. In fact there is a current inaccuracy, we already have a few large main websites, the biggest being the greatest purveyor of advertising: Google. (There's nothing I like less than being someone's bitch; they like to call it 'standing on the shoulders of giants'.)

I don't know, it's like with 10, I feel, that there was more of a character. and with 11 the plot feels more rushed so he has ~what feels like less time~ to develope a character. So he kinda flip flops between what feels like a 9 year old to a general in the army. He's the two extremes of Niner and Tenny. 
Like when he's angry he is nine 
and when he's happy he's ten
It just feels like he doesn't have his own personality. Every Doctor brings something new and the way 11 was written makes him feel wishy-washy between Doctors. Kinda like a recap. 
I think it's mainly because moffet was trying to put a lot of information in to very little time. He's trying to explain River and give Amy and Rory plot as well. 

I feel he was bragging. He wispers it do himself. Like just a remind to himself. 'Oh House is bragging about something I did a hundred times over.' It wasn't a ""You killed dozens? I've killed them all. That's who I am. Look me up. your next. you stupid thing, you're hurting my sexy TARDIS.""

I'm biest though. I dislike Amy enough for it to ruin 6th season and 11. For reason I can't even explain. I just dislike her. Love Karen as an actor just dislike Amy.

He is quiet and relatively boring (I love di Matteo, but it is true), so the British press leaves him and Chelsea alone.

&gt; Salon.com is ad supported;

Fine ignore that, I turned off adblock and perhaps refreshed too fast or something. GG stands as he does solicit micro donations. Replace this with all the citizen journalists around Occupy, who are doing everything from live-streaming to sending up their own drones equipped with cameras and putting the MSM to shame. 

&gt; Wikileaks isn't journalism, it's a whistleblower data repository;

You've [got to be kidding me](http://wikileaks.org/Guardian-s-WikiLeaks-Secrets-and.html); and a spoon isn't a spoon it is a metallic spade to dig food. At least you didn't call them high-tech terrorists.

&gt; Richard Stallman is opinion (something the internet will never lack) not journalism.

You are being incredibly narrow about what journalism is, and you seem to be reducing the definition to press releases or mindless documentation. Everything is opinion, always, every writer has his biases and can only ever include a small subset of all knowable facts. I would even argue it is opinion and insight that is far more important than a matter-of-fact regurgitation of events. If I want to know what is happening I can now look at twitter, if I want commentary I can find experts in any field. I don't need traditional corporatised ring fenced journalism, I need independent journalists.

&gt; I'm not saying that journalism can't have other revenue streams, or that it shouldn't accept articles from experts outside the profession, but simply that the whole thing cannot be supported without some core revenue stream.

Again initial scope included all types of content. Second, you are giving no reason and I'd add why on earth do we need to 'support' big-media anyway? It doesn't need to exist and its complete lack of usefulness is apparent in the governments we continually are given, and the crimes they have failed to unearth. The behaviour of the guardian and others to wikileaks has been disgusting and they are supposed to be the best we've got! It is not surprising that they have gone on this 'open-journalism' charm offensive to try and win back credibility.

&gt; (Don't try to say 'a ha! but reddit has ads' because none of that goes to the creators.)

It's relevant if you look at people creating content for content's sake without remuneration, which was the initial scope.

&gt; So presumably you can provide a list of executives that have moved from one to the other. That's what revolving door means, after all.

Yes. I know they have different owners, but they share similar agendas. Numerous links:

* Dame Liz Forgan: Has chaired the Scott Trust since 2003. She was formerly an independent director of Guardian Media Group plc, director of programmes at Channel 4 Television, managing director of BBC Network Radio and a Guardian journalist. She is chair of the Arts Council England.
* Andrew Graham: Joined the Scott Trust in March 2005. He is chair of the advisory board of the Oxford Internet Institute and an elected member of the Council of Oxford University. He was economic adviser to the prime minister from 1967 to 1969 and from 1974 to 1976, and to the leader of the Labour Party from 1988 to 1994. From 1998 to 2005, he was a non-executive director of Channel 4 Television, and was the master of Balliol College, Oxford, from 2001 to 2011.
* Antony Salz: Joined the Scott Trust in 2009. He is an executive vice chairman of Rothschild. For most of his career he worked as a corporate lawyer with Freshfields, becoming senior partner in 1996. He was vice chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC from 2004 until the end of 2006.
* Mark Tompson: has been Director-General of the BBC since 2004. He is a former chief executive of Channel 4. He is the highest paid employee of any public sector organisation in the UK, earning between £800,000 and £900,000 per year.

They are also ran by the same very wealthy media class, the 1% as it were. Hell, Anthony Salz works for Rothschild and worked on the BSkyB merger. 

&gt; As I understand it, there is no copyright for current affairs. Could you enlighten me on how the system works at the moment?

The ASA response is [here](http://asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/2/Healing-on-the-Streets_Bath/SHP_ADJ_158433.aspx) (it's very short, and worth reading), and the complaints they upheld were:

* The claim that the advertiser could heal the named conditions was misleading and could be substantiated.
* The testimonials misleadingly implied that the advertiser could heal the conditions referred to.
* The ads were irresponsible, because they provided false hope to those suffering from the named conditions.
* The ads could discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought.

The ASA's remit is to make sure that ads are ""legal, decent, honest and truthful"" - they have to try and interpret things as a ""normal"" person would, so ""I'm the best!"" would be fine as hyperbole whereas ""I won the Tour de France in 1981, 1988, and 1995"" would not (unless some kind of obvious caricature/humour/etc).",0,1332990128,null,0,true,0,c46499a,t3_rhxzz,t1_c46499a,t1_c45zv02,null,1428614532,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"Are you sure he's going to be fifth string, and if he is what does that say about our transfer plans?

I'm pretty sure we're all hoping for a new CB this summer, most of us Vertonghen I would imagine. He would come in and be first choice alongside Kaboul. We'll then have King, Gallas, Dawson and Nelson on the bench, making Nelson sixth choice, not fifth. Does taking up 6 of our 25 squad places with CBs not seem like overkill?

So maybe that means one of the others will be going. Kaboul? Definitely not. Gallas? Well we gave him a two year contract extension back in May, so probably not him either. King? Maybe it's going to be time for him to retire, but he's put in the appearances this year to convince me he's worth having as a back up for at least another season, and Redknapp seems to agree - he'd certainly be getting the nod over Nelson for that role. Dawson? I'd be happy to move him on, but I know that isn't a popular opinion among Spurs fans in general. And if he did go we'd have a 34 year old, a 35 year old and a 32 year old with one knee as our CB backups next season, which is a bit of a worry.

So maybe this is a sign that we don't plan to invest in that extra CB (Vertonghen) that we're all hoping for, which would make this pretty bad news in my book.

And all that's before bringing Caulker into the equation. Been one of the division's best CBs this season, so where does he fit in? Another year on loan wouldn't be such a bad thing, but Redknapp's said a few times that he has big plans for him next year. Also a little worried that he'll get too fond of Swansea - don't want to lose this guy.

So, my point is that while fine on the surface, this news could be the consequence of some upcoming transfer strategies that might not make us too happy.",0,1332995663,null,0,false,0,c465abh,t3_rhd9b,t1_c465abh,t1_c45tyho,null,1428615021,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,bchan31,lfc87,null,"There are the obvious ones first. Aquilani will go, Cole will go, Aurelio will go, and probably Maxi too. Darby needs to go soon as does Pacheco. The jury is still out on Wilson. I expect at least one, if not both of Doni and Jones to leave. To be honest, Reina doesn't look too happy either and we may have a goalkeeping dilema on our hands come the summer. 

As for incoming transfers, I expect us to sign a cheap winger. I've heard rumours that we've been tracking Matt Phillips recently and Pilkington earlier in the season. I wouldn't mind someone with pace like a Sinclair or Dyer. Farfan, Hoillet, and Kalou are all available on Bosmans in the summer too. 

I honestly think we need another striker as well. We've heard a lot of the term ""fox in the box"" and I do think it's quite accurate for what we need. I would like to see Morgan given a few cameos at the end of this campaign to see what level he's at. I doubt he's ready, but why not try him at this point. Ivica Olic is available on a Bosman in the summer, but he is getting on a bit. 

Villareal have made it clear that they will be making a few squad changes this summer because of finances. Rossi and Nilmar come to mind. Rossi still has a huge fitness concern after his bad injury, but it could also mean that his price has taken a dip because of it. It would be a risk, but I think he's a quality player. It's pretty obvious that Nilmar wants to leave and its well documented that he's good friends with Lucas. However, I think he will move back to Brazil in the end.

Luuk de Jong is a player that I really like. He's a fantastic finisher, has a great footballing brain, and is decently mobile too. His value, however, is ever increasing, and I think it would be wise for us to move for him before the Euros if we do indeed decide he is the right player. 

There has been a lot of talk about Jackson Martinez from the Mexican Primera. I haven't had the chance to watch him play yet so I'm not so sure about him. Another player in a similar situation is Matias Suarez. He seems like a good enough player, but would probably be a risk.

The idea is to warn the public that longer term fuel shortages may be coming, of course this will change behaviours, I myself filled my tank yesterday after doing some shopping, I had half a tank left and usually would leave it until the weekend but based on this I decided to fill up early.

So people can be a little more aware and appropriately keep their tanks stocked up so that if there is a fuel shortage, they might be able to last a bit longer with the use of their car.

Affelay would be interesting in an attacking role, he could well be available having really not gotten a chance at Barcelona. Others who could be considered would be Sinclair, Marin.

We need another forward desperately, but i'm at a loss on who we could sign given our likely budget (i've heard £50m), lack of CL football and general lack of available strikers across the leagues. 

I reckon the addition of three players in these positions would give us a lot more flexibility in what systems we could adopt, while at the same time improving the squad.

Departures: Aquilani (unfortunately because I think he's a top player and would have loved to have seen him given a chance), Spearing (just not good enough), potentially Adam if we can get a decent bid.

As much as I don't like Downing, I think we should give him a second season along with Carroll and definitely Henderson. Also would like Joe Cole to be given a role next year.",0,1333024546,null,0,false,0,c4685b9,t3_rg8yt,t1_c4685b9,t3_rg8yt,null,1428616356,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

*Edit:*  I went back and worked out the correct answers for all the questions because I rushed it a bit the first time.

***

###Numbers

* **54**:  Two interleaved sequences (2,6,18,54; multiplication by 3) and (5,4,3; decrementing)

* **3**: Two interleaved sequences (8,16,32,64; doubling) and (12,6,3; halving)

* **2**: A sequence formed by adding the even numbers in series (0+2=2, 2+4=6, 6+6=12, 12+8=20, 20+10=30, 30+12=42)

* **48**: The lower number in each column is the upper number multiplied by the number diagonally to its right (2×4=8, 4×6=24, 6×8=48, 8×10=80, 10×[12]=120)

* **63**: 2^*n* − 1

* **21**: Repeated division by 3

* **13**: The first few prime numbers

* **20**: The uppermost number in each column is the sum of the two numbers in the column to its left (though I don't understand where the bottom row comes from)

* **54**: Alternate halving and tripling (24÷2=12, 12×3=36, 36÷2=18, 18×3=54, 54÷2=27, 27×3=81)

* **255**: 4^*n* − 1

###Solids

(Taken in order reading across left to right first, rather than down the columns.)

* **Could be**: The back of the solid is hidden in both pictures, but it has enough sides to have any combination of shapes on it

* **Could be**:  One way would be for the hidden side to the left of the triangle in the first picture to have a blob on it.

* **Could be**:  There could have been an arrow hiding round the back in the first picture

* **No**: The prism is more elongated in the second picture than in the first, even though the dot could be hiding

* **No**:  The black face in the second picture has already been shown to be white in the first picture

* **No**:  The second picture is a mirror image of the first, but the solid is chiral (i.e. it has a handedness)

* **No**:  The first picture is a pyramid with a triangular base, but the second picture is a pyramid with a square base (even though it could have a second dot somewhere)

* **No**:  We're shown that the base of the pyramid is black in the first picture, but it is white in the second picture

### Grids

* **2nd**: Going down each column, the bracket thing rotates 90° anticlockwise, the filled-ness of the shape alternates, and the shapes follow a diagonal-square/semi-circle/triangle progression

* **4th**: The top square of each column is the overprinting of the lower two squares (though the angle of the diagonal lines is a bit off)

* **3rd**: To go from the top image to the bottom image, rotate the circle 45°, and populate it with the shapes from the corners in the same order

* **5th**: To go from the left image to the right image, put the shading pattern in a small square and then put the circle with a diagonal line in it next door

* **5th**: There are only two types of cells in the whole figure, and they're arranged alternately

* **5th**: To go from the upper picture to the lower, reflect horizontally and swap filled circles for hollow ones

* **3rd**:  Going down the columns, rotate each cell 90° clockwise",0,1333026301,null,0,true,0,c468d0z,t3_riyw3,t1_c468d0z,t3_riyw3,null,1428616455,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Bill Shankly was the first of the great Liverpool managers and he instilled many of the values that made LFC great. Going back to him will help you understand what the club is about. He is also the one that 'designed' the famous all red kit. 

Bob Paisley is our most successful ever manager, bringing home 3 European Cups and he is the one who really built upon the foundations laid by Shankly. 

We were pretty untouchable throughout the 70s &amp; 80s with a great tradition of Scottish, Irish and of course English players. 

We were the first team to wear a shirt sponsor, Anfield was the first stadium to have a McDonalds in it (no longer) and Liverpool v Arsenal was the first match to be shown on Match of the Day in 1964 (MOTD is an English football show on TV).

We have won 18 League titles (2nd), 5 European Cups (3rd), 7 FA Cups (4th), 8 League Cups (1st) which makes us one of the two most successful English teams (depending on how you measure it) with Man Utd. This, along with the traditional city rivalry with Manchester, is why they are our greatest rivals.

So no science has ever been based around taking test samples or following trends??
I was actually thinking you where beginning to make some decent points, you can't just pluck numbers from air, all numbers have to taken from something, meeting people, talking to people, asking why they are out of work, looking at their living situations, looking at the last time they had a job.

The same goes for science, I assume there has been a lot of ground work, test samples, trend identifications and hands on work to actually produce statistics.

Yes I believe the vast amount of unemployment in our country is down to to the people as opposed to the number of jobs available, rather than telling me I'm wrong, show me why I'm wrong.

I've delivered my opinion and how I came to that opinion, all you have down is told me I'm wrong, you haven't actually said or produced anything that clearly shows I'm wrong.

I'd rather listen to people trying to find people jobs for the unemployed, people working with unemployed families, people who conduct job interviews, people who live and breathe this situation over anyone else.

If I go to Mcdonalds and all their staff tell me that they spit in all the food, but you show me a form with Mcdonalds fantastic food hygiene stats on it, I'm going to listen to the people who cook the food and tell me they spit in it aren't I?

I was talking to a Sri Lankan family today, they have been here for 8 weeks, they can only just speak English, yet they are both full time employed, one in a chip shop, the other in bargain booze? How have 2 immigrants come over and both found full time jobs so quickly and easily despite not being able to speak the language well, no qualifications and no English work experience...attitude, work ethic and the fact they will work for low pay because having a job is important to them.

As a professional statistician, please explain how it is so many foreigners are still coming over (yes I know some are leaving) and finding work?? consistently, in fact enough work that parties like the BNP are now seeing record numbers, because 'foreigners are taking our jobs' Polish, Indian, Nigerian, Chinese, they can all come over with no qualifications, no mastery of the language and find work in the blink of an eye, I personally see it as they will do the jobs the average white English is 'above doing' or is too proud to do, how ever I'm sure you're going to tell me I'm wrong and will have Indisputable evidence to prove it...

And please explain to me how MY observations do not support MY conclusions? how does that even make sense? of course they do...because they have?

If I like a painting, you can't show me graphs and numbers to show why I'm not allowed to like it, it's my own conclusion based on my observation of the painting.

You should've mentioned it whilst you were there, they can then do a pump check (called something like that) where they measure some fuel out into a container at a certain size, then compare it to the readout. Depending on what it says, it may be giving out more or less than what it says.

My mum told me a story one Sunday that this woman came in, saying that it didn't give her enough fuel. My mum went to do a check and it turned out it gave her too much.

Anyway, as I was saying, you should've said something whilst you were there. I suppose you could go back there now, tell them what has happened and ask them to do something similar.

Do that before ringing Trading Standards, this might get it sorted and they'll probably offer you a refund (on the difference), I can't say for sure though.

This is an often problem, that their either dispense too much or too little, but usually not by that much I THINK.

Men will continue to get dragged out by their girlfriends for saturday shopping and impulse buy and some people still enjoy leaving the house to buy things in town, they are the only physical games shop left and there is a market for this.

Make retro and hardcore gaming a key part of their target market and strategy, the buy and sell is profitable and people like discovering old and new unusual things. Hardcore gamers are willing to spend good money on the top accessories from the states ect especially if they are able to test them first.  

Release dates for big games should be made into proper events for the gaming community, this is big community willing to spend money and they have the chance to engage it, but have been useless at it so far. A lot more could be done.  

Utilise their brand online and hire a good team, they to need hire amazing content writers from the community and build their model around it, instead of trying to be the mainstream option, which will get crucified by amazon and other competitors. 

The gaming community is big, loyal and willing to spend, but it expects to be treated well and understood, GAME was terrible at this and the majority of gamers disliked them as such. Their previous target customer was parents buying presents with the occaisional impulse buy, which has been mauled by Amazon.  that said I doubt that an RBS consortium will pick up on this and it could be money down the drain. 

Also the government has an investment in RBS which remains a private company, the state owned part is like me saying I own Barclays because I have shares in them. The whole investment was given with the intention of being a relitivley silent shareholder who will later resell.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"We can bemoan the savings issue over and over, but it's clear that any attempt to save on the part of Labour would have been met by Conservative challenge about how they were 'wasting tax revenues' and 'failing to invest in communities'. It's the nature of politics, and they would have been pressured to spend or faced electoral backlash.

That's somewhat irrelevant to the point, mind, but I feel that this coupled with the excessive cost of the bank bailouts would have annihilated any benefit irrespective.

I feel we could perhaps still take the Keynesian approach, given that both our current options run the risk of significant economic destruction if it goes wrong, at least one has a proven track record in creating short term growth, and given lending has increased as the economy has slowed down further, it seems we're only lending more now to 'patch up' the damage that the Coalition is doing to the economy rather than any form of attempting stimulus.

However, I suppose it also depends upon the state of International trade; if we're not selling many exports then our stimulus attempts would be for naught. The global (or local European) economy would need to work together to ensure we could boost each other's economies and create sustainable demand. Towards that end, Europe really is our only option and they aren't doing too well either, and we don't exactly manufacture or produce things that Europe actually needs since we decided that banks were our new best friend.",0,1333044621,null,0,false,0,c46bxh1,t3_rj3i2,t1_c46bxh1,t1_c46av4y,null,1428618260,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Would if I could. I know it's a rubbish answer but I'm not an economist. I'm probably not qualified to be discussing any of this but very few people are.

Top economists can't be expected to agree on many things so I think you just have to go with what seems reasonable to you.

&gt;you're only looking at £3bn a year. Our deficit is £120bn a year so it's not even an argument

This is the problem with discussing stuff like this. There are a lot of little things that I think would help like cancelling Trident, changing the tax system to reduce the possibility of evasion, lower MP's salaries, stop using PFIs, reduce our military presence abroad, etc.. It's always linked to so many other arguments that you get bogged down in the details and rarely reach any kind of consensus.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Just on a brief glimpse the article justifies high debt levels with comparisons to Italy (not the best example on hindsight) and Japan (which has the advantage of a domestic population that really likes to save and buy government bonds, thus not relying as heavily on markets/governments ect). 

Yes our government had a higher debt level after world war 2, our economy was in little pieces and it took a long time to pay back the US, this is not a situation we wish to repeat. We also enjoyed rather nice periods of growth, which helped quite substantially. The world is also a different place now, we are far more globalised, interconnected ect. The risks are far higher, we are not special. 

Bond yields are low largely because markets have faith in our seriousness and ability to tackle the deficit. (It is also helped by the rounds of QE where the government has been buying our own bonds helping to decrease the price of borrowing). Using it as a reason to not take the debt/deficit seriously is a little silly considering the reason is so low is because we are tackling the deficit (although the argument could be made that we could ease the pace/depth a little in response to this. We still couldn't make a U-turn).

It then mentions that the cost of the national debt is increasing noting that it was £48.6 bn (which is more than we spend on the military) and is larger than some of the cuts that we are making. Not sure what its point it's trying to make is. It seems to highlight that it is a big problem that is getting bigger and should be tackled. Or maybe it awkwardly left it there in hopes that no one would notice it. 

It then goes onto mention how future national debt is still going to increase up to 2015 (not sure how this is helping its argument). It then talks about economic expansion without explaining how it would achieve this (yes it would help tackle the debt/deficit, the question is how). It makes the point of how taxes/spending cuts can dampen growth, once again it is correct, they can. What are the alternatives though and would it be less dangerous to pursue the course its advocating. 

""Problems of National Debt

Interest Payments. The cost of paying interest on the government’s debt is very high. In 2011 Debt interest payments will be £48 billion a year (est 3% of GDP). Public sector debt interest payments will be the 4th highest department after social security, health and education. Debt interest payments could rise close to £70bn given the forecast rise in national debt.
Higher Taxes / lower spending in the future.
Crowding out of private sector investment / spending
The structural deficit will only get worse as an ageing population places greater strain on the UK’s pension liabilities. (demographic time bomb)
Potential negative impact on exchange rate (link)
Potential of rising interest rates as markets become more reluctant to lend to the UK government."" 

Worth reading that bit of the page, not very easy to dismiss as easily as the author does.

It then talks about different types of debt, we might not top all of them in terms of GDP per capita, but we do worst overall.

Here is the issue they have:


For most people they start a job working for say Greaves Graves working in an office and they stay working at that office for that same company until they leave. The company may change but maybe only once. 


This is what the equivalent would be in most jobs with the tanker situation.


You work in an office on the 2nd floor at 123 Letsby Avenue for a company called Hobbs and Co. Your job is as a book keeper doing the accounts for Bills Bits Ltd. You get periodic training, a certain amount of holidays and a pension is set out for you.


Then after 2 years all of a sudden Bills Bits wants Hendons to do the accounts. So Hendons take over the building and all the equipment. You are doing the exact same job with the same tools but you get your terms changed in regards to pension, holiday pays, staff training. 2 years later Bills Bits wants Krafty Werx to do the accounts. So Krafty Werx takes over the building. You're still doing the same job in the same building using the same equipment as you were the day you started but yet again, your terms are changed in regards to pension, holiday pay, staff training.

Bale's attempts do just this. A few shots draw outside the box will draw midfielders and even defenders onto him whenever he gets the ball, because they know he's a threat.

I want to see less attempts at short crosses in the box for headers (this is the EPL, everyone does this and it's fairly easy to defend against) and more shots outside the box.

Corporation tax cuts don't do a thing for growth, supply-side theory is totally disproven at this point. It may have worked when the west was on top, but with the BRICs rising all corporation tax cuts seem to do is provide businesses with more capital that they invest overseas.

http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/14/sweden-lessons-idUSL4E8D66DP20120214

Try reading this and see the similarities in our situation, you need realise that we are 5 years past the financial crisis and we have to make cuts at some point, if we just leave it we'll end up like Greece. Even under the current model which is labelled aggressive, we will be running the deficit until 2015/16. The cuts we are making are of about the same level Sweden made and much like them it is complimented with structural privatisation.  

So if the government spends more, firstly how much? and what on? Where do get this money from? the financial markets would put rates up which would cost even more and where would the sustainable growth come from. Infrastructure is the obvious place to start spending, but the current government is already putting large amounts into infrastructure with a mix of private and public money and this takes time to filter through.

my personal feelings towards her are not as pointed as I appreciate that every reaction has a cause and the symptoms you rightly describe above we're given an opportunity to flourish due to the utter incompetance of the previous Labour gov and self serving and defeating militancy of the unions taking us to the IMF. 

I personally like to entertain the possibility that in a post imperial Britain which still clung to a notion of global significance despite its obvious deficiencies, it would have been too humiliating to admit that at least the initial tranche of privatisation was enforced from overseas, and much easier for the Tories to play the jingoistic trumpet and spin the situation to look like we were leading the world in infrastructural innovation.

true,White667,uk,United Kingdom,"You do realise that the amount of debt a country has doesn't actually matter at all? What's important is the difference between economic growth and the rate of interest that debt has.

Basically, if your economy is growing faster than the interest you're paying; the debt is worth it. The Tories are trying to lower the amount of debt the country has, rather than increasing the economic output of the country. It's counter-intuitive, the more they cut spending the less likely we'll have any growth. If the economic output is falling then the debt becomes *more* of a problem *sooner.* Meaning it'll be even harder to lower the debt enough to make it more effective than simply encouraging growth through spending. 

If you owe someone money at 3% interest, but you've got all that money invested and are getting 5% interest back on it; then it doesn't matter the amounts involved at all. The most rational option there is to **never** pay the debt back, as soon as you do you stop making the 2% profit, the lender stops making the 3% profit and the people benefiting from the investment (employees etc.) lose their benefit from the increased capital.

We aren't going to end up like greece - we have a functional tax system and much smaller public sector than they do. We're also much more developed and have a higher skilled workforce.

I'm not an economic analyst so I don't know exactly how much £ needs to be spent to stimulate the economy, but the simple idea is:

Stable economy = private sector is working, government runs a budget surplus

Economy in recession = lower demand in the economy due to failing private sector

Government steps in = spends money to compensate for that lack of demand

Private sector picks back up again = government withdraws spending and the economy sustains itself again

Where does any economic growth come from? It's a perpetual motion cycle that relies on one thing - demand. If it isn't there, it starts moving backwards - which is what we are seeing here.

I'm not sure if genetics play into it much, though. They're Time Lords - they're so far advanced from anything we know, I don't think gender/biological sex would be much of a barrier for reproduction for them. There's promising real life research right now that could lead to human reproduction no longer being restricted to male/female pairings, how much farther ahead must Time Lords be?

&gt;Generally, I don't see why it is useful for the government to own businesses that operate in competitive markets, and this article doesn't really make a case for a government doing so.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, privatising 999 calls does not seem wise. The police will have an agreement with Capita where they pay £x per year, and Capita have the provide a service. The agreement will have KPIs (key performance indicators) which Capita have to comply with, based on time to answer calls, number of calls missed, etc. etc. Capita are incentivised to only spend enough money to meet those KPIs, and do absolutely nothing more, because the rest is their profit. I doubt this gets a better result than having an in-house call centre, where the managers want to get the best result possible with their budget of £x.
&gt;
&gt;Presumably Capita are also paid less than the previous internal budget was. Otherwise they wouldn't be outsourcing.
&gt;
&gt;Privatisation does not magically make activities more efficient.

You're correct that when in neutral, the engine is ticking over and using fuel, but that is also equally true for when the engine is in (any) gear. When you have fully let off the throttle, you are supplying the engine with the same amount of fuel regardless what gear you're in.

What makes coasting in neutral (or with the clutch fully engaged -they are the same thing for what we are considering) more fuel efficient than leaving it in 5th (or any other gear), is because the engine itself will generate a resistance to the gear it is in. Think about it; if you're cruising along and drop your gear into first (if your synchromesh will allow you), you rapidly come to a stop. You cannot deny this. You could call this retarding effect on the momentum of the card 5/N, where n is gear you've dropped into.

In second gear you will slow down somewhat slower, but you will still slow down rapidly. The same will be observed up through the gears up until 5th, where the retarding effects will be considerably less than in first, but still much much more than in neutral.

That to me is the same as when you find out that someone is a member of a fundamentalist religion, they've stepped beyond the bounds of what a reasonable and an intelligent person can converse with, thus excluding you from looking on them as a contemporary.

In Moffat's run we've seen him set up plotlines like ""why did the TARDIS explode"" and dropping them in favor of new ones like ""the Silents"" which he in turn does not complete (we still have no idea who they are nor are we any closer than we were at the beginning of the series).

It's like he has brilliant concepts (cracks in time, the Pandorica, the Silents, an army of Angels) and then no real ways on how to blend them into the story as if they were planned (the cracks turn from portals linking two points in space and time in Eleventh Hour to erasing fissures, we have no idea how the Pandorica was made, or by whom, or how all his enemies were willing to seal him in it instead of simply killing him, we have no clue who the Silents are and their plans seems bizarre and contradictory (they want to prevent interference in time, and already have spaceflight of their own, but they influence humans to go to the moon, and somehow this is an evil thing?), and the Angels' rules of not being able to look at each other and not moving when viewed are thrown out the window).

There are just so many hard left turns that the series has to make to accommodate Moffat's changes (like the ""she was here the entire time, just trust us"" Mel or her even more pointless and bizarre decision to take them to go kill Hitler (which is forgotten early in the first act, mind you)) that it's foolhardy to believe that he's planning much of this at all.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"Firstly my information on Sweden is all well and up to date, the reason I used their economy as an example is that they are a social spending based state, that got themselves out of a financial crisis by following pretty much the same plan that we are following back in 1998 and have gone on to do very well as a result, read the article. Nothing to do with any neo-liberal fantasy you seem to believe that I have. 

I have no objections to the public sector, I thinks it's great and makes our country a great country and would like to see it move closer to what the Scandinavians have. What I don't believe is that it creates sustainable growth and should be heralded as the tool for fixing our economy. 

We are not in a recession and have not been for some time, if we were in one I might agree that a stimulus would be the correct thing to do to stimulate demand, but there is a difference between escaping a recession and building a sustainable economy for the future.

The sort of growth required to get rid of the deficit is not going come from increased government spending, there is only so much demand they can stimulate until growth will slow again. It's short term fix to much a bigger problem. The government needs quite over ambitious growth and cuts to get rid of the deficit, if it was relying on growth alone it would need double the current hopes, which is what 5-6% growth a year. This is not possible through a 2.5% cut in VAT and maintaining spending as it is, as Labour like to make out.    

You make the assumption that we live in a vacuum and demand is not present in other countries already and it can only come from personal consumption in our own country. We have no money to spend so anything we do spend will need to be borrowed from somewhere and eventually leaked out to foreign nations as our imports are much higher than our exports. 

Government created internal demand is not sustainable for long term growth as it can only add in growth what you borrow to fund it, which incidentally is what we did for the last ten or so years in public debt, personal debt and private debt, that is until it was realised that the whole model is a Ponzi scheme waiting to topple and we along with many other countries realised we are borrowing too much in an attempt to continually fund growth. 

Why use Greece as an example when you can use Ireland which is equally developed, has a very similar social system, educated workforce and functional tax system to us.

http://www.cnbc.com/id/46756118/St_Patrick_s_Day_Message_Ireland_Isn_t_Greece

Also to believe that corporation tax makes no difference is crazy, global companies base themselves on every continent and pick the most competitive nation to do so, just look at Glaxo Smith Kline deciding to create a new research and production facility in the U.K as a direct result of the budget or Nissan choosing to create it's new model in the north east. Both of these examples could have chosen any other European country to base themselves, but chose the U.K for business reasons, these will both result in GDP growth which is supply side economics, which you claim to be a unproven, every emerging nation that has a trade surplus is reliant on supply side economics as is Germany who's sole reason for a successful economy is manufacturing and exporting to other countries.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Hmm besides the regeneration episodes and the very first and last episodes, you should watch Deadly Assassin, Invasion of Time, and The Five Doctors, for lots of Gallifrey stuff. And The Three Doctors.

For a general feel of all the eras, I've got a list here:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only, reconstructions are in place for the missing episodes).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His era is mostly missing so its hard to get a grip his era. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh- Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis.

Galloway has done an excellent job of tapping into local issues. This is a seat that swung TO Labour from both the LDs and Tories in 2010, unbelievable.

The Labour candidate Imran Hussain was deputy leader of Bradford Council, a Council that presides over the [hole in the ground that should be a Westfield shopping centre](http://t.co/O4xbhEQH), has [ignored the people's protests over the Odeon and worked with the local media to spread lies about it's condition ](http://t.co/1adt7We8), and also presides over the 145th best set of schools in the country (out of 155). 

Just this week it was announced Bradford is the most risky retail investment in the country, we've lost two more stores (Game), our Rugby League club is in serious financial trouble and our football team isn't far away from oblivion in the form of relegation from the football league. 

Put simply, the people of Bradford are very pissed off. 

This is about anger at local government, and who better to target than the deputy? Ballot samples in 'white' areas have had him winning there was well, so I don't buy any talk of the muslim vote doing this.

Some may applaud, but I worry about a potential BNP protest vote in certain wards come May.

Dude, if it wasn't so late I'd give you a Pikachu! Rare to come to any sort of conciliation through mediation without a third party (bit of a contradiction, but it seems applicable).

Kinda gave up on Reddit recently, partly due to other avenues and lots of work. Was very uncertain of bothering with it again as the sheer volume of responses and trying to return in kind with more than just my own blocks of text takes time (just feels bad/a bit weak to not address each and every counterpoint). 

Add in sheer trolling/winding up and it's a real drain. As you say kinda say in your first para, it gets to be a grind. 

Added you to my 'friends' list. It's a bit playground ish, but in lieu of Pikachu and lots of upvotes it feels apt.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Avoid self-insertion.  Remember the story is ""Doctor Who"", not ""my awesome character who gets to hang out with Doctor Who"".

Write the best story you can, with rising action, complications, crisis, denouement, all that good stuff.  But keep it simple.  A great deal of the joy of Doctor Who is in the details.  You're writing an episode, not a series.

It is tempting to throw everything, and the kitchen sink, into your first work.  Don't.  Less is more.  But at the same time, the story also has to be tightly paced.

Show, don't tell.  Conversations should happen while the characters are occupied with something important to the plot, not while they're standing around uncertainly.  Try not to let anyone turn into the Exposition Fairy.  Avoid Info Dumps (except when you do it in a fun Doctor Who way, where he's rattling on and no one's listening).

Use outlines.

Ask your friends for feedback.

Don't forget to be funny!  Doctor Who can tug at the heartstrings, but it is not an inherently dark or grim show.  Scariness is very cool - and traditional - but it's always leavened with some humour.  Even the bit with Amy's melting baby was lightened with the Time Lord crib.

Good luck!

**From my co-writer:**  If you actually want to submit the script for consideration, watch the budget!  No exotic locales, no machines that cost a lot of money to make.  They're more likely to buy scripts that are cheap.  And don't introduce new characters.  Every new speaking role costs money.  Budget, budget, budget.

He sees Doctor Who as being a sort of fairy tale, so make sure you keep this in mind. Stone Angels that move when unseen, living shadows that eat flesh, clockwork servants, slenderman grey aliens.

Doctor Who is best when the idea is simple, but with this fairy-tale like twist. It's science fiction, but first and foremost it's meant to feel timeless and a bit magical.

Give the Doctor room for speeches, but don't get heavy-handed or try to shoehorn them in. Some of the Doctor's best speeches are to babies or his one companion in private, it doesn't need to be a spectacle to be powerful.

Have a theme. Make sure that you have one concept you want to carry throughout the episode. For example: if you wanted to have an episode set entirely in the TARDIS galavanting throughout all of it's many fantastical rooms you'd want a theme of the Doctor's past, and how much of it has accumulated hidden away. A past that he's just tried to run from that's built up in his very backyard.

And yes, make it stand-alone and independent of specific events. Obviously you'll have to pick a Doctor and most likely a series, but try to keep it light and loose.

And yes: above all, be hilarious. That's why many of us love the Doctor, not his sweeping speeches about humanity, but his witty asides about Virginia Woolfe on his bowling team.",0,1333074585,null,0,false,0,c46hwni,t3_rk942,t1_c46hwni,t1_c46hrc5,null,1428621120,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

The biggest one being that the bond markets continue to lend to us at low rates, as soon as that stops we go into Eurozone death spiral mode and it starts to look like the last time the Tories took over from Labour, the other condition is that the stimulus actually works. Lets assume it works in the short term, then what? more stimulus? 

I massively dislike the social policies of the Tories, but in terms sorting the economy they are doing the right thing in my opinion. Investing and pushing for private sector investment in infrastructure, making the business environment competitive and doing everything they can to attract global business to locate here, but it will take time, there's no quick fix to an unbalanced, uncompetitive economy.   
Listen to this and hear it for yourself from a global business if you don't believe me http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9707000/9707956.stm

I don't really agree with the internal growth argument, it's only any good when it's equalled by foreign investment and exports. If it was valid we could just borrow and give everyone loads of money and the problem would be solved and we would continue to grow forever. The tax receipts that the government loses from cuts, is from employee's that are paid for by tax revenue, the money just circulates but a portion is siphoned of by spending it on non U.K companies that import to us. Yes there is more money in the economy as a result but that's just because we borrowed more and put it in, it's not sustainable growth, which is what we'll need if we are to ever attempt to pay back our debt.   

From a social perspective I disagree with the cuts and believe that our country is better with a bigger state, just not from a long term economics one.  ",0,1333078717,null,0,false,0,c46iovk,t3_rj3i2,t1_c46iovk,t1_c46i389,null,1428621511,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Just a few suggestions:

The Title ""Doctor Who"" just seems slapped in there. Everything else has this great sense of motion and then the title drops it flat. Could there be a bit of motion going on? A pull in or swirling background or something?

Instead of pulling back on the Daleks, could you have them all simultaneously turn to the camera as the strings stab? And then pull in on the eye for the scene transition? Just a thought.

Otherwise quite brilliant! Congratulations!

Heh, OK then.  Instead I'll tell you that the New Tories (the way you affectionately cling to the old name is most quaint) are just as bad as the Old Tories.  They're both self-serving and thoroughly corrupt.  They just have different paymasters.  Mandelson should be in jail several times over because of all the corrupt shit he got up to.  Blair should be tried for war crimes.  Sorry pal, but they're just as bad, albeit in different ways.

They have absolutely no idea how to manage an economy during a recession and just as in the 80s their policies do not work, I lived through that so I know exactly what life was like, so the TV swhow boys from the blackstuff if you want a clue.

&gt;""Investing and pushing for private sector investment in infrastructure""

This all has to be paid back by the taxpayer, we will end up paying more than if the government makes these kinds of investments, because the private sector wants profit, they dont do this for free.

&gt;The economy isnt in such drastic danger you have to sell everything off. That policy is the policy of failure, the Royal Mail makes money for the government and provides a low cost efficient universal mail facility. The private sector will take the rich pickings and not service the higher cost areas. This is will known yet still they persist in following unpopular short-term legislation and the country loses out and pays more. 

Simply put privatisations have largely been a disaster, we have gained little from any of them. Better managment and restructuring are just as effective.

&gt;From a social perspective I disagree with the cuts and believe that our country is better with a bigger state, just not from a long term economics one. 

The Conservatives are attacking the working class again (a freeze on the mimum wage, benefit cuts, taxing pensioners) and using it to pay the rich (a cut in the 50% rate, not dealing with bankers bonuses, no extra tax for the bankers, no financial tax to let the city know their risky behaviour will not be tolerated again, lets buy the queen a new yacht) - the tories are and always have been the party of the super rich, they lie there way into power and transfer tax revenue into the pockets of the rich when they are in power. This is the party that oversaw the famine in Ireland all those years ago.

Finding a decent flat can be a bit tricky, though that might be because I'm from Sweden and have pretty high standards.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi.  Congratulations on your move to Edinburgh.  It's a small, but beautiful city.  The people are considered to be not as friendly as those of Glasgow, but that's not true these days.  Few other cities have such awe inspiring centres, with the castle dominating the sky line.

The good areas of Edinburgh are subjective.  However, here's my opinion:

The Grange.  I'm guessing you're not millionaires, so I'll just skip this.  If you are superbly wealthy, [the Grange contains Scotland most expensive street](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-16348190)

[Stockbridge](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=stockbridge,+edinburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=55.957873,-3.206484&amp;spn=0.00991,0.027874&amp;sll=51.116603,-1.484301&amp;sspn=0.022225,0.055747&amp;hq=stockbridge,&amp;hnear=Edinburgh,+Midlothian,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16).  I used to live here, so I'm biased.  But it has a lot going for it.  It has a community feel, with excellent fishmongers (where my Japanese wife buys fish fresh enough for sashimi), an excellent butchers, a few charity shops stocked by the wealthier inhabitants of Edinburgh, as well as trendy bars and bistro/gastropubs and a large waitrose supermarket (as well as an excellent world beer shop).  It's a very short walk to the night life of the city centre, and is well serviced by buses and taxi.  It has the water of Leith running through it where nice walks can be had, or even a spot of fishing.  It also has a cycle route running through it.  Stockbridge is also very close to the Royal Botanic Gardens, which are excellent.

[Morningside](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=morningside&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=55.928914,-3.193588&amp;spn=0.039669,0.111494&amp;sll=55.926846,-3.198395&amp;sspn=0.039672,0.111494&amp;t=m&amp;radius=2.59&amp;hq=morningside&amp;z=14).  Although a little further out of town, and with slightly heavier traffic running through the main street, Morningside is generally considered one of the best areas to live.  Similar to Stockbridge in its makeup, it attracts the trendier / wealthier set.  You're as likely to see a yummy mummy pushing her designer pram as a posh old lady as you would some public school clubbers 'ya-ing' it up for pre-club drinks. Morningside is a short-ish walk to the Meadows, which is where everyone heads, portable BBQ under the arm, as soon as the mercury hits above 15c.  

[Broughton street / Inverleith Row](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=broughton+street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=55.960924,-3.191378&amp;spn=0.009909,0.027874&amp;sll=55.96078,-3.190885&amp;sspn=0.009909,0.027874&amp;hnear=Broughton+St,+Edinburgh,+Midlothian+EH1,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16).  Broughton street borders Edinburgh's pink triangle, the main gay friendly area (although Edinburgh is very gay friendly generally).  Again, there are a wealth of small artisan shops selling speciality cheeses, breads, fish and meats.  There are slightly more pubs and bars here, and it's less of a family area to head to as it is on the border of a night life area.  That said, go a little further north (down hill) to Inverleith, and you're in the middle of a very well to do area, with chic cafe's and bars.

An honourable mention goes to:

Leith walk / Leith:  considered separate from Edinburgh by it's locals, it's going through a revival, however still retains it's rough around the edges charm and working class roots - despite the plethora of Michelin starred restaurants and chic bars that now occupy the area

Marchmont - With the likes of JK Rowling owning flats here, it's a good area, although can be cripplingly expensive.  Favoured by posh Edinburgh university students, it's close to the Meadows and a short walk to the city centre.

Merchiston - V. Expensive (as far as I know).  Good local amenities and close to the Meadows / city centre.

Platinum Point - Older Edinburgers hate it, the younger set like it.  New build flats set out on reclaimed land.  Without a doubt you'll have amazing views, however you'll possibly find yourself in a flat with a small ceiling, and structural problem / poor quality neighbours.  That said, rent can be low and you may find you're pleased with what you get for your money 

(Typically Edinburgers will favour a Victorian built tenement flat over a new build and rent reflects this.  We like old stuff!  This horrifies my wife who's from a culture that prefers to knock an older place down and rebuild a nice shiny new place to live.  It's down to what you prefer most)

These areas listed are probably ideal for a young couple / husband and wife.  Probably less so if you have children and want a slightly more suburban lifesyle.  If so, let me know.  Areas such as Colinton, Inverleith, Duddingston, Corstorphine (my area wahey!) and Fairmilehead are generally where established families pack up and head off to where there is more space, schools and less built up city.

Poor quality areas:
Sighthill, Wester Hailes, Granton (not *that* bad), Pilton, Niddry, Gilmerton/Liberton (nice but has problems).


As far as service providers go.  Cable is not universal here, although our chancellor has earmarked Edinburgh as a place where ultra-fast broadband is being implemented in coming years.  If you want the fastest broadband, you'll have to check to see if your area is serviced by Virgin.  I'm on a 30mb speed which is fine (Virgin offer up to 120mb speeds) for me, and which costs around £60 a month including line rental, TV and telephone service.  I found Sky TV to be far superior when I had it and will probably move back.  I'll stick with Virgin for their broadband speed though.  

I'm with [Ocean Dental](http://www.oceandrivedentalcare.co.uk/).  They're good and have a nice surgery.  Also do NHS work.

Personally I'd go with an agent.  I actually rent a property out as a landlord just now (don't worry I'm a nice one).  I use the company click-let who have been nothing but professinal, and my tenant seem to be very happy as well.  They are a young team and very helpful.  [Check them out](http://www.click-let.com/)

I'm with the RBS because I'm a shareholder and have banked with them all my life.  They gave me a descent mortgage.  Studies have shown that Britons are more willing to get a divorce than change their bank accounts.  A word of caution as I saw someone recommend HSBC.  They only have one single branch in Edinburgh, whilst RBS and HBos have hundreds everywhere.

I seriously fear that the USA might send the world economy crashing next January when bush tax cuts expire, payroll tax breaks end, the debt ceiling will be reached again, defence cuts have to be automatically enacted due to not making enough savings, extended unemployment benefits due to end and a host of temporary business tax cuts expire, this is all going to happen at once and they will still be running a huge deficit after this all comes in. It's fine to have growth now, but cuts have to come soon and it's not gonna be pretty. 
A massively optimistic outcome might be a slow decline and shift of power to the East. Will be interesting to see if they manage to maintain the growth they have at the moment, but I can't see how it's possible.

I would buy an abandoned amusement park, and start paying people to spread rumors it is haunted. Soon the entire town would just call it ""the old haunted amusement park."" Then I'd invest in those realistic, but still vaguely uncanny-valley masks they make. I'm not entirely sure about the face yet. I'm torn between a Martha Stewart mask, The Rock, or Samuel L. Jackson. Maybe just a creepy clown. Then I'd get a very realistic ghost costume, and use some crazy strobe lights and fog machines to make the abandoned haunted amusement park seem really spooky. Once teenagers started coming up there, I'd drug the smoke and knock them out. While they were unconscious, I'd strip them, and spray some lubricant on them. 

No, I wouldn't rape them. This isn't going there.

After that, I'd just dress them up in ridiculous costumes, and let them wake up on their own, thinking they'd been attacked by a ghost who vaguely looked like the Snakes on a Plane guy, but in clown makeup, who stripped and raped them before dressing them up in a child's sailor outfit. 

So yeah, I wouldn't rape them though. This would be way more interesting.

EDIT: Oh! Oh! Oh! I just thought of the coolest way to improve on this. I wouldn't pick a mask, see? I'd wear ALL the masks at the same time!

You seem to be oblivious to the fact that any spending of any nature requires private investment, which people make money from and the tax payers lose out from, seeing as WE HAVE NO MONEY, it's all borrowed from financial markets (the big bankers you hate so much) with interest attached and we have to pay it back.

Royal mail is dying at a rate similar to HMV and Woolworths due to email and has an £8b pension deficit, times change, anyone under 30 does not post letters unless they have to and companies are rapidly converting to on-line billing, not only for cost but environmental reasons. It's not a profitable money maker for the tax payer and will not be without heavy investment, a huge cut in service and a cull in union control. It's competing with globally efficient businesses like UPS which use brand new technology and pay minimum wage, to be honest I'd be surprised if anybody did want to buy it. 

Attacking the working class by giving a tax break to every working person in the country, sure. The 50% rate is funded by other taxes on wealth such as stamp duty on mansions, child benefit for those on over 60k and the pensioners lost next to nothing in this budget, the whole commotion behind it was laughable also banks have had their levy increased again this year.

In an old fashioned carburettor based engine you would be correct, but modern engines (both petrol and diesel) use fuel injectors that inject fuel directly into the pistons. These can still cut fuel completely when coasting in gear but stil recover before the engine stalls.

http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuels-and-environment/drive-smart.html

&gt;Modern car with electronic engine management – fuel and ignition systems are effectively combined and controlled by one Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Take your foot off the accelerator and the ECU cuts the fuel supply to the injectors anyway so there's nothing to be gained by coasting.

You can do a simple experiment to verify this if you are on an empty level road. In a low gear (first or second) get the car moving and then take your foot off the accelerator. Your car will begin to slow down. As the speed gets very low (just before it stalls), it will suddenly start to go slightly faster as the idle system kicks in.

The only way I can think of for you to buy yourself a ticket, would be to go on the website and buy a Hospitality package. I don't think you need to be a member to do this. It will be expensive, but it's legit and you're not relying on anybody else

* Move somewhere with good public transport - your husband has a job but you don't yet and it could be anywhere. There are really cool areas like Leith which are great - but if the only job you can get is in Edinburgh Park then you'll be screwed (unless you drive).
* Also pick where you live well as it will be better for meeting new people. I prefer closer to the city - we are in slateford which is pretty good. We were in morningside for a while which was nice as well - but Slateford is better ;) 
* It's not a great place for cats - a lot of apartment style living.

Do me a favour, go to a job centre on signing on day, assess the clientèle and then come back and try to tell me that all these people are want to be hard workers who are just down on their luck because of a recession, there will be a few, but I promise you the rest are just going through the motions collecting their free money, first stop job centre, second stop off licence.

Diesel does not suffer as much from this, but can develop gums and sediments that can block filters. Also if moisture gets into the fuel then fungus or bacteria could develop which also degrades the fuel.

true,[deleted],null,null,"By all means check my math, it's friday and I'm tired, but here's my take on this:

According to the [IMF](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=68&amp;pr.y=19&amp;sy=2006&amp;ey=2011&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=112&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&amp;grp=0&amp;a=) The UK economy as a whole is worth $2.4 and change TRILLION USD.

This £32m, is not even 0.0007% of the economy as a whole. In fact, it's very roughly [The amount local councils spent over the past 3 years on refurbishing their offices.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12151924) It's so small when you are talking about trillions, you could pass it off as a statistical anomaly.

But, since we are talking about GDP growth in the context of this ludicrous idea that this is some type of conspiracy theory: 

For the sake of clarity, let's do year on year annual GDP figures.

The consensus is that the UK economy grew at 0.8% in 2011 - this is then, in $ form, worth roughly  $33600m. I'm going to keep it dollars, again, for the sake of clarity.

£32 = $51

51 % of 33600 = 0.0952% (and change). 

So, that $51m is 0.09% of the 0.8% annual GDP figure (not the actual % change, just the part OF the growth). Granted, this would be slightly higher quarterly, but still not even close to enough to make a statistical impact.

Slightly more up there.  Includes this:

&gt; ""Vodafone investigated Mr Saleem’s complaint and sent him an explanation and apology.

&gt; They said the store manager felt Mr Saleem’s appearance was 'rather scruffy and not business appropriate' but admitted he focused on discussing Mr Saleem’s beard rather than the rest of his appearance.""

snip

&gt; ""We have absolutely no mention of beards in our dress code. In retail stores, we ask that employees wear branded clothing and present a neat and professional appearance.

&gt; We do accept that the manager of the Sutton store focused not just on general standards of neatness but also on the neatness of Mr Saleem’s beard and this could have been misunderstood.

&gt; The manager decided that Mr Saleem was a suitable candidate to work in our store and we asked him return to the store the same day to start work. Unfortunately, Mr Saleem felt unable to do so.""


From this I conclude that this 21-year-old lad turned up looking a bit scruffy, and that part of the manager's criticism included mention of his unkempt beard.

Truth is that not only is petrol a gas at room temperature, that gas also has a habit of sticking to clothing and even skin, if you walk through a room with lots of petrol fumes in it and then go near an ignition source, you will become a human torch even without a spot of liquid petrol on your body.

You've clearly had nothing to do with it if you think the decisions are made by ""medical professionals, who specialise in assessing whether a person is fit to work,"". The whole system is a cruel joke that tries to catch out the ill through traps, tricks and out right lying. The people who now can get through it are much more likely to be fraudsters than people who actually need it.

Major flaws include, unsuitably qualified assessors, bonuses for getting people off rather than getting it correct, an evaluation method that can't take into account sporadic issues or treatment plans/health management. And just outright fraud. 40% in all get the benefits back, and where they have advice (e.g. CAB) the number is around 70%. All those appeals cost money to administrate, and in fact extra staff are having to be hired to deal with the huge number of appeals. Many who don't appeal aren't able to get the information on how to, and so it's a poor measure of whether they needed them or not.

Secondly, the major reason for people being moved off is not because they were fraudsters (the fraud rate is incredibly low &lt;0.5%), but that the goal posts have been moved. As a result a large number of people who can not hold down a full time job are being pushed into poverty.

Personal experience? Wife was passed fit to work while recovering in hospital from major surgery. We were unable to get any information on how to proceed, because (a) only one person had been trained on what to do and (b) she couldn't advise in case she was wrong and we sued her. We found the right information and got the application in with 1 day left on the deadline. We were warned to use registered post (extra expense) since un-registered appeals seemed to be not arriving at a surprisingly high rate. The whole thing was stupid because if they'd spoken even once to her doctor and been able to include treatment in the assessment then money that could have spent helping people wouldn't have been spent pushing bits of paper about.

The whole system is designed to output the minimum amount of money, whilst providing a veneer of social responsibility for the ruling party du jour. (started by Labour, expanded by Tories), and not actually efficiently or effectively achieving it's end goal.

Criminals don't answer to you or me. That's why they're criminals...outlaws. They operate outside the system and outside acceptable social norms. They don't care if you're outraged, they don't care if you're angry. They expect it. They do what they do *because* they don't care.

The police and the judiciary on the other hand are intended to serve *you*. When they fail *you* there is outrage. Who do you call when the police are criminal? The police? Who will judge a legal system when it's corrupt? The same said legal system? That is where outrage comes from and comparing it to concern for society on the whole is missing the point.

The author of this peace does the ""black community"" a disservice as it assumes in the face of gang violence, something we are the most likely to be victims of, we haven't and don't make moves to try and fix it.

[Mother Against Violence](http://mavuk.org/) was set up by the mostly black mothers of gang violence. [Urban Synergy](http://www.urbansynergy.com/) was set up by a black female colleague of mine and I'm involved in it as a mentor and volunteer. The [100 Black Men of London](http://www.100bmol.org.uk/) is another charity trying to tackle the lack of strong male figures in the lives of the sort of black males that carried out the shooting leading to Thusa's injuries. Just because the journalist and others are unaware of these organisations doesn't mean they get to judge every black person as if we all took part in the summer riots.

Ignorance is no excuse.

Organisations like the ones above are what will turn these criminals around, and stop others becoming criminalised in the first instance, not the sort of impotent rage shown during the rioting. In the few cases where the anger was borne out of frustration that frustration was at a sort of futility of a situation where the very people charged with protecting us seemingly could execute us in the street and be applauded.

Japan at 600% is considered to be such an economic mess that a entire phrase, japanification, has been invented. I think the US, for all it monetary flaws is only at around 200%

The risk comes from the prospect of another serious crash. At 950% it is literally impossible for the state to take another tranche of distressed assets onto its balance sheet.

Again whilst you are correct about the balance of A&amp;L's, it does put enough focus upon the concept of rehypothication which in laymans terms (or lehmans perhaps) is where financial institutions are able to leverage collateral holdings or assets under management for their own books... It is called such because hypothetically the banks hold these assets even though they don't in reality. Therefor liabilities are able to be accrued to ridiculous multiples of the value of the underlying asset without there 'actually' being an asset. London is the place where the worlds financial institutions come to partake in this practice and therefor the liabilities are held on the books in the UK.

You've got pre-established characters and settings, which allows you to focus on storytelling and plot.

You can also learn a lot about writing from other fans, in the fanfiction forums.  When you find a writer you admire, ask them to beta a story for you.  It's a great way to apprentice in the writer's craft.

Also - a wonderful book to read, though not specifically aimed at scriptwriting, is ""How Not to Write a Novel"" by Sandra Newman.  Hilarious and spot-on.

Unfortunately the situation rapidly spiraled out of control before the courts could get involved.

&gt; Well at this point it's almost as if you've completely ignored my last comment. I mean, totally! It's not the same thing...I don't really know how else to explain it. I've tried, but it seems beyond me now if you don't seem to have really at all read what I wrote.

It's not that I haven't read what you wrote, it's that I still have questions. As I honestly don't know anything about ""the black community"" in London, my interest is mainly directed towards the press and the reaction people in places like Reddit. Why did this incident trigger such outrage about the polices actions but London's gang violence isn't really mentioned.

&gt; You say Duggan's actions lead to his death, but that's only true if he was wielding the weapon and the police were in danger. We simply don't carry out the death penalty, even on guilty men, in the middle of the street. The simple fact that there seems to be some sort of cover up and that the police again initially lied about the incident should make you at least interested in why. 

Again, the only thing which could be considered a lie is an unofficial comment made by an IPCC spokesman, it wasn't an official statement by the police on the subject even if it was reported as such by the press and the grapevine.

As for the actions of the police, you don't have to be brandishing a weapon at them to be considered a threat. Witness statements indicate that he didn't comply with the warnings he was given, and in a situation like that, until the person is secured they are still considered to be a threat. These are standard ROE's the police use across the country, and there was nothing special about this situation. If the police think you might have a gun (or a knife), they will treat you as armed until they know you don't. Even if it's in your waist band, the Tueller Drill comes into play here.

&gt; Jean Charles de Menezes, what did he do to facilitate his own death? The armed police have proven to be slightly trigger happy when they assume they might be in danger. Not only id this a failure of proper intelligence gathering, it begs the question, are the right men in the right job?

That was a different situation. There, the biggest error was the breakdown in communication and intelligence gathering. I don't blame the trigger pullers for their actions because they acted according to the SOP and ROE they have been trained to use, I blame the commander in charge of the operation for failing to manage her operation. And the cover up they later stuck to was unforgivable. ",0,1333113743,null,0,false,0,c46me76,t3_rjv0t,t1_c46me76,t1_c46m97e,null,1428623237,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

He never found any word of serious criticism against the theorem that increasing the quantity of money cannot effect anything else than, on the one hand, to favor some groups at the expense of other groups, and, on the other hand, to foster capital malinvestment and capital decumulation.

where is your evidence, that sounds like a personal opinion to me, personal opinions mean jack shit according to you.

Maybe you really want to live in the world where there are no jobs, 2.67 million are unemployed against their will, all 2.67 million of them try and get work as hard as they can day by day but the recession is stopping them getting that job, they turn up to to interviews on time, tidy, clean and smartly dressed, they sell themselves as best they can to get a job.

You're living in a dream word mate, and I don't even need to prove it, because it's my opinion, and we're are now both at the stage were a personal opinion is enough to justify your conclusion.

Again how is that any different than me saying.

The vast majority of unemployed are so due to their personality and attitude

But you're right, I'm wrong yeah?

Ah, so you were there? I mean, the police seem a little reluctant to tell people what did happen but you seem to be clued in. Do tell.

&gt;It's not that I haven't read what you wrote, it's that I still have questions. As I honestly don't know anything about ""the black community"" in London, my interest is mainly directed towards the press and the reaction people in places like Reddit.

The point wasn't rreally about the black community. Notice I spoke about police and judiciary corruption and said ""you"" a lot.

Take this example. Baby P. Remember the press and public outrage? It was because a child was killed right? Fuck no. A child was killed yesterday and another will be killed tomorrow. The outrage was because the *system* failed. He saw doctors, social workers, nurses, police. No one spotted the abuse. That is what the people were riled up about. It's not the death, it's the situation around it and it has nothing to do with race. Do you believe that all babies have been safe and sound since the death of Baby P? I've not seen similar press and public outrage so it *must* be right? you and I both know there is still child abuse and death going on, but the outrage just isn't there. Why would it be?

In the other two points there's clearly no seeing eye to eye as long as you believe a situation that is still to be be publicly investigated has been adequately explained as far as you're concerned. All the people calling for an enquiry clearly have a lot to learn from you as you've gleaned all relevant information and come to a conclusion already. I mean when the IPCC say there are details of the case that are so secret they don't even want a judge to know what they are yet you're 100% sure you've been appraised of all details I have to tip my hat to you.

true,gettinggatsby,null,null,"Tickets for matches against less popular sides go on General Sale usually 3 weeks to a month prior to the match. If its Premier League, depending on where you sit, you're going to spend between 52 and 70 pounds for Adult tickets. FA Cup matches were 30 this season, which was fantastic.

They rate the category of the match from AA to B, with a derby being the former, obviously. General Sale to those AA matches won't happen. You could try your luck and show up the day of the match and see if any member tickets have been put back up for resale, but those are in extremely high demand, not surprisingly. But for B category teams, they seemed pretty easy to get. I know this season, the Stoke and Wigan matches stayed on General Sale for a good long time. Same goes for the Newcastle match. You might be up at the top of the East Side, but it's still a thrill to be in there!

My best fellow non-member advice is to just keep checking the Ticket News section of the website a couple of months before you pop over.

true,White667,uk,United Kingdom,"I don't really get what point you're trying to make.

Japan has a **public** debt to GPD ratio of close to 200%, Britain isn't even above 100%, hell Greece is only at 120%. The US economy, from all economic indicators, is actually pretty much recovered. It's just peoples perception that's keeping it down, at this point.

And banks have a way to keep asses offa' their balance sheets, they also have a way to keep liabilities offa' their balance sheets (Mortgage backed securities, anyone?) So, again, that's just a pointless assertion. That calls for new regulation, not economic concern. 

We're not leveraged as high as you seem to make out. More than that, most of our public debt is due to bailouts and monetary policy used to deal with the 2007 credit crunch. Hell, the British people have less credit card debt now, we're trying to get out of debt (and forgoing consumption) which is making it more likely we'll get back into a recession.

If you want to start looking at Japan, they were basically unaffected by the 2007 global crash because they had spent so much trying to get outa' their own 1995 asset bubble burst. If you wanna start comparing us globally, I doubt we're likely to have huge isues if something goes wrong, like, now.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"As always, I recommend beginning with the 2005 reboot, Series 1 Episode 1 ""Rose"". Understand that like most show's pilot's it's a bit rough and there's this dated bloom filter on everything, but if you understand that the show gets better, it's far more palatable. 

If you want to skip some episodes as you go along and just get the cream of the crop (which I did, it allows be to go back to a Doctor and have ""new"" episodes starring them after you miss them) here's a rough plan, marking episodes as:

***-Series 1-***

Rose 

Aliens of London/World War Three *(a two-parter)*

Dalek *(one of the show's best)*

Father's Day

The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances *(a two-parter that's also one of the show's best)*

Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways *(series finale)*

***-Series 2-***

The Christmas Invasion *(important character introduction here)*

New Earth *(a nice episode, really here because it begins a plot thread)*

Tooth and Claw

School Reunion *(great episode that gives nods to Classic Who)*

The Girl in the Fireplace *(one of the show's absolute best)*

Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel *(a two-parter)*

The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit *(a two-parter)*

Love and Monsters *(****NOTE:*** *I love this episode, but many find it polarizing.* **Try watching this as an introduction**, *as is is Doctor-lite)*

Army of Ghosts/Doomsday *(a two-parter)*

**-Series 3-**

The Runaway Bride

Smith and Jones *(introduces new character)*

Gridlock

42

Human Nature/The Family of Blood *(a two-parter)*

Blink

Utopia/The Sound of Drums/Last of the Time Lords *(a three-parter, watch at your own peril as it's a bit wonky, but vital to plot)*

**-Series 4-**

Voyage of the Damned *(if you really feel like it, it's not a vital episode, but it answers one pressing question you'll likely have)*

Partners in Crime

The Fires of Pompeii

Planet of the Ood

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead *(a two-parter)*

Midnight *(one of the show's best)*

Turn Left *(on of the show's best)*

The Stolen Earth/Journey's End *(the grand finale)*

**NOTE:** There are a series of feature-length specials after this. There are four: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, and The End of Time. **The End of Time is the big finale for an era of the series and is vital to watch**. The others are good too, so watch those as well, I suppose.

**-Series 5-** *(note how this series has a vastly higher budget)*

The Eleventh Hour

Victory of the Daleks *(I don't like this episode, it's ridiculous, but it's a bit vital to understanding a few things)*

Amy's Choice 

The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood *(this one's really ho-hum. I'd suggest skipping it, but you may find it important)*

Vincent and the Doctor

The Lodger

The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang *(two-part finale)*

**-Series Six-**

The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon *(two-part premiere)*

The Doctor's Wife

The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People

A Good Man Goes to War *(plot-important episode)*

Let's Kill Hitler *(plot-important episode)*

The Girl Who Waited *(If you want, some people really rather like this one, but it's not vital to watch)*

The God Complex

Closing Time

The Wedding of River Song *(plot important finale)*

The best-of-the-best (that aren't spoiler-y and can be enjoyed without seeing other episodes) are Dalek, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, The Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, Midnight, The Eleventh Hour, Vincent and the Doctor, The Lodger, The Doctor's Wife, and Closing Time.

But you'll likely decide to just watch all of them in order (which I recommend) after a little while, so feel free to watch whatever you want.

I think part (if not all) of the reason that they decided not to strike is because of what has happened over the last 2 days.

The advice that Cameron and his cronies gave was sensible advice. If they hadn't have said it, the panic would have been worse during or closer to the real strike.

The only fault was how they said it. Which I didn't even think was that bad.

Galloway's literature made a lot of both really, Afghanistan was one of his planks, education was another, the state of the City Centre was a third one. Plus there's the obvious anti-cuts etc.

Bradford hasn't been noticeably decimated by the cuts, it's Retail was shrinking long before any sign of the oncoming recession (although we're now told Westfield was mothballed due to it, strange considering Lehman Brothers collapsed a year after that, did Westfield predict the recession and not tell anyone? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)

Bradford has been ran by both Labour and Tory/LD administrations in recent years, the leaders of both Labour and the Tories were also part of the board of a group called Bradford Centre Regeneration, [**which spent a lot of money on executives and artists impressions**](http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politicians-blast-cost-of-bradford-projects-with-no-start-date-1-3031603), but appeared to achieve absolutely nothing in it's existence other than assist with spreading lies about the old Odeon building.

Bradford is a cross-party balls up, it's a wonder there are only two BNP Councillors (who are now independents actually). I believe that's due to the work of Hope Not Hate, who put a lot of work into some areas.

I'm hoping Bradford votes for a Mayor and in November we'll be able to vote for an Independent who knows their stuff, but this is Bradford. The Status Quo is shite, but what alternative is there?

That Bradford West felt compelled to vote for George Galloway says a lot, this is a city that's desperate for change and that they're willing to go out in such numbers for an outsider (18,000 voted for him, 15,000 voted for the Labour candidate in 2010) should be sending a message loud and clear. 

The mainstream media seem to think this is an 'anti-war' vote which I'm sure that was a major issue with some. But for me, this is a vote for change, something has to give.

Edit:

&gt;Wrack explained that people who don’t have garages could be tempted to store fuel in their homes, and there could be disastrous consequences from this if there’s a fire in their house or at a neighbouring property. It’s already illegal to store over 10 litres of petrol in two five-litre plastic containers in a house. Since this isn’t even enough to fill one-third of most cars’ fuel tanks, this advice isn’t very practical.

I meant ""got it from"" as in ""what sorts of information it used"" not the physical source. All the data I used came from the ONS, Eurostat and The Economist. But they're mostly just key indicators, not a composite, so are widely available to all. 

And my point about that it's not a commonly used key macroeconomic indicator? I mean, well, it's just not. I hate making arguments that are hard to really backup, I've got (literally) 23 economics textbooks on my coffee table here, none of them mention ""total (in the sense you mean) debt to GPD"" ratios.

The main thing is, generally government debt and household debt should be kept separate. I mean government debt is a matter of policy, household debt isn't. Government expenditure (the use of most of the debt) is part of what makes up GPD. Household debt is mostly asset backed, there are different types of household debt.

I would argue that total household debt v. total household assets isn't that useful a statistic unless we actually look at the breakdown of that debt. (credit card debt isn't that high compared to secured loans, which would make sense for a small island.) More than that, if you look at the data over time, credit card debt is starting to fall, the value of assets (although volatile in the short term) all rise in the long term. There's not really that much of a risk, when looking at British households. 

The only real argument you could make is that of the government debt, if you have to result to lumping in extra liabilities (household and private debt) it just weakens your argument. *Even if* you had a point, the fact you couldn't make it only using information about the public sector, makes it seem like you're reaching and don't really have anything based in fact.

Why would we do this? The Falklands as a territory is no more Argentine than Tuvalu is. Talk of ""returning"" them has the double whammy of A) the inhabitants not wanting to leave us and B) having absolutely nothing to do with Argentina. There is not one single credible reason why it might be ceded to Argentina. Any oil/mineral deals can be done (and we've attempted to) with it still under British jurisdiction. But the crux of the matter is internal to their national discourse and is about their nationalist pride. They need to swallow it.

There is NO threat of war, now or in the future. We vastly outspend and out-train their military so it won't be possible for them to engage in conflict, at least for another 50 years if they sort their country out.

Their politicians exploit the national pride/grievance in their veterans and people who remember the war. These people are generally poorer, and were educated about the Falklands history when they were under a military dictatorship. They quite literally don't have all the facts when it comes to the subject. However, there is a new generation of educated Argentines for whom the war and desire for the Falklands is an embarassing hangover from the military dictatorship. In short, the nationalist desire to ""reclaim"" the Falklands will die off with the veterans (within 50 years).

[A lot of serious people in Argentina don't believe in their claim](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17148157).

The only other place it needs putting to bed is in our newspapers/media. The right wing press (dailymail/sun) lower the discourse with sensationalist, militarist [reactions](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110338/Falkland-Islands-lost-Argentina-invaded-warns-commander.html?ITO=1490) to the Argentine government's whining, which the left wing media (guardian/BBC) then take as an opportunity to [self-flagellate](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/17/jingoism-england-ebbing-power?mobile-redirect=false) about [""Empire""](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2012/03/argentina-britain-islands-oil) and promote and instigate some equally sensational false ""debate"" about it, most of it based around Thatcher for some reason, almost as if she invaded it.

So bored of both of this merry dance we're led on. By all means, exploit the oil, and Argentina can benefit from the increased traffic and surrounding industry. But any serious debate between governments along these lines it stifled *by them* and the hell of their internal politics.",0,1333123328,null,0,false,0,c46o6at,t3_rkxfm,t1_c46o6at,t3_rkxfm,null,1428624083,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7
