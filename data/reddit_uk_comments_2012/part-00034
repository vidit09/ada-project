I think if you think about it...the fact that there's not much to comment on is a comment on it in itself.

Besides...I have my own mind and I can decide whether I find it cool or not. I just don't understand that big of an appeal of it. It's like if I posted on a tech subreddit about someone actually doing their job for about 5-20 minutes. It's great for the poster and all but not actually that interesting. There's no twists in the story, nothing really that unique about it, nothing really amazing happening. Also hair cuts are a very visual thing....and all we get is a picture of Tennant (who we all have seen many times already) rather than a picture of what actually happened. Anti-climatic and totally not worth even opening it up!

I watch Doctor Who because of it's uniqueness and the fact that it is interesting and that drives what I want to see on TV or the net. This just doesn't really fit in that.  Sure, others may not agree and that's ok, but allow me to express my opinion of it. It's not like I'm attacking/insulting anyone. But the lack of other comments atm kinda prove my point.

That's one of the massive problems on this subreddit. People are scared of commenting or posting opinions, discussions or anything high effort as they may be downvoted into oblivion in the tidal wave of...whatever stuff others want to post.

as such :-

1) influence cannot be bought .

&gt;The entire series was building up to the Old Ones being these hugely powerful vampires that were going to take over the world and then poof, they're gone. The only good thing I can seem to bring out of that is that now Hal is the only Old One left and that could be interesting.


&gt;I also didn't like that Alex, someone that only recently became a ghost, could suddenly throw vampires around like Annie can. She sees Annie do it and then suddenly she can do it too. I remember it being a big thing that Annie could do that, a sign that she was more powerful than the average ghost, and now that just seems a bit trivial.",0,1332754094,null,0,false,0,c451exr,t3_rdyjt,t1_c451exr,t3_rdyjt,null,1428595507,7,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,7

Clean yourself up a bit too, as much as possible anyway.  Doctors are wary of handing out sedative medication, giving them yet more reasons not to (looking a bit dodgy) isn't going to help.

They're likely to want to try something mild first, I'm not sure if it still is but back when I worked in NHS pharmacy there was quite a few doctors who would prescribe Melatonin (named patient basis) presumably in an effort to avoid going straight for the addictive stuff (benzodiazepines, zopiclone etc.).

If we are going to be very direct pressure Benfica then I think Drogba may be best to lead the line.

Unfortunately as per usual people allude to the fact that the employer has every right to have their own opinion of what looking professional means, if Tesco doesn't like her having purple hair then maybe she should find a job where it is tolerated.

If an employer says, ""we think it is unprofessional if you look like this"" and then you still chose to do the thing, you are being unprofessional as you are just flouting the rules set by your employer, which is the very definition isn't it?

&gt;No party is immune from these problems. Indeed, the leader of the Labour party has himself encountered some controversy in recent days. That is why the government has invited Labour to restart the cross-party talks on reforming the current rules.

&gt; But today I make this offer once again to the Labour party. I'm ready to impose a cap on individual political donations of £50,000 without any further need for state funding. But to be fair this must apply equally to trade unions as well as to private citizens or businesses.

He's trying to shift the focus onto the Labour party and put the ball in their court, and even more cynically, he's suggesting a solution which will be of huge benefit to the Conservatives, but will hurt the Labour Party. If he wants a cap of £50,000 per donation, then The Conservatives will remain financially wealthier than Labour, as there are more wealthy individuals and businesses (who make up the bulk of Conservative financial support) than there are Unions (who's donations make up the bulk of Labour's finances). The Union's donations would be capped at £50,000, making Labour struggle for finances.

It's not a workable or fair solution. We need macro-payment support for political parties, a cap on campaigning, and a law that says all campaigning finances should be published and cannot be bumped up through donations. 

Let's not let him turn this crisis into an opportunity. He's so slippery it defies belief, four major scandals and resignations in his government, the Andy Coulson affair, and now this, and yet he marches on as if he's not set a foot wrong.

We can't enter it into dog shows unless its KC registered. However to get it KC registered, it has to have an eye test for a breed defect. It also had to have an eye test for the Sheep Dog register which it has had. But the KC won't accept the eye test for the sheep dog register and insist on their own but it is done for the KC at an age where it is too late to detect it which makes the whole thing pointless.

I have one plea to make. Next time you see charity collection tins for the RSPCA, don't put your money in them. Put your money in the charity tins for other animal charities instead. If you put your money in the RSPCA tin it doesn't go to directly helping animals but instead to running their ""police force"".

http://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/myth-of-automation.html

&gt;There will be no fully automated working in London for at least four years, and that would only be between Waterloo and Bank, on a line with no intermediate stations. Moreover, thus far the public preference has been for retaining a train operator, which is also useful when there are problems, and especially on open sections of track (see above).

http://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/yikes-chaps-no-driver.html

&gt;The Central Line was the first line to have ATO introduced in place of lineside signalling, initially in the central area only. The installation has not been without its problems, and unlike the Victoria, it has a lot of surface running, where slippery, wet or icy rail conditions makes some manual use of the controls unavoidable. TOps are trained to enable them to make the necessary intervention, as well as oversee station stops and be able to perform a range of safety related tasks, including evacuation of the train, if necessary.

http://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/crikey-readers-no-driver.html

&gt;Moreover, for London, going driverless would mean overlaying any new system on infrastructure that is – Jubilee and Victoria Lines excepted – very old indeed. That is why the first candidate for this technology is the Waterloo and City Line, which has no intermediate stations and has only recently been substantially refurbished. And the “four years” timescale only brings first testing.

&gt;It should also be borne in mind that only the Victoria Line had ATO from the start: introduction on the Central took time, and that on the Jubilee is still not bedded in. Full automation is a major step beyond this. Looking at Barcelona once more, the first conventionally worked line to be converted will be Line 11, which was only built recently and is the shortest on the system.",0,1332768752,null,0,false,0,c452ntl,t3_re3mw,t1_c452ntl,t1_c4528gr,null,1428596111,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Nine definitely has several layers of emotion to him, and I think Eccleston did a great job on it.

I don't understand why so many people say that his later attitude toward the show ruins his Doctor. How does what he did after filming his episodes change what happens in them? I'll always have a soft spot for Nine, because he was my second Doctor (my friend made me start with the Tennant years), and I was worried about how I'd react to different regenerations and whether I'd be able to see them as the Doctor.

The overwhelming majority of the Police Service (they aren't allowed to say Force these days) are armed only with an aluminium stick and a pepper spray. These aren't much use against the type of threat you specify. Of course another type of threat would be a ""Mumbai style"" attack whereby a crew with rifles decide to attack a mass of civilians. Once again, the unarmed Police would be useless in this scenario.

It's best to prevent these things happening but if it's going to happen then the best way to deal with it is to shoot the other guy before he sets off his bomb or shoots anyone else.

The missiles you mention are surface to air missiles. Better to have them available and not use them than not have them should the need arise surely ?

Sorry, but you're reasoning is a bit flawed here. What you have determined is that the people who can dress well/speak well are the ones most likely to get a job if it is available. However, it has no relevance to the *overall* level of employment. This is a function of the number of jobs available and the number of people with qualifications and physical access to fill them.

So dressing smarter may make you more likely to get a job, but it doesn't affect the overall number or type of jobs available (or people's ability to access them). The fact that you make that connection does just sound like classic old man grumpiness to me (""Kids these days ..."").

People can keep listing their excuses as to why they can't get a job, 
but simply put, if you have a good attitude and don't think ""I'm better than this"" about jobs, then you can get a job, call centers, super markets, door to door sales, etc etc, there are thousands of these jobs that anyone can get if they show willing, why aren't recruitment companies closing down left and right? they all have hundreds of jobs in their windows.

I'll admit and am proud that despite being 27 I'm a grumpy old man, but me being grumpy doesn't change the fact that unemployment is just as much down to attitude and laziness as it is a general lack of jobs.

Just look, someone as grumpy and stupid as I have managed to stay employed since leaving school, and every time I need a new job, I apply for lots and am inundated with requests for interview, I don't hold any fancy qualifications, but I have a good attitude and work experience, experience I got my taking bull shit entry level jobs that everyone else seems to be too proud to take.

How many people have a well written CV that is custom fit to the job they are applying for, then how many of those also send a well written covering letter along with it, and then how many of those actually go to the interview clean and tidy, then how many of those people turn up on time for interview?, then how are able to go through an interview and look professional? not fucking many.

Like I say, I see this shit every day, 17 years olds applying for £20'000 IT jobs because ""I'm not doing that!"" when it comes to the bottom of the ladder job, students who think because they have been to uni they get to start on £25'000 a year basic, and if they can;t find that job they will just say there are no jobs.

The numbers of jobs are there in black and white, go and look at them, this no jobs talk is absolute bull shit.

How do you know this for sure ? I don't think it's possible for you, a bloke on the internet, to have a more accurate assessment of the threat to the Olympics than the UK security services.
&gt;Anyway, a bomb or even a Mumbai style attack doesn't require 13,000 troops.
A few well trained teams in the event of the unexpected.

If not 13,000 then how many, in your opinion, do we need ? How many troops per team and how many teams to guarantee that you can prevent or quickly stop attacks against ""legitimate"" targets ?

I have no idea what the existing UK air defence coverage of the Olympic sites are but wouldn't you rather have them temporarily in place in case you need them rather than not have them if they're required ? They're obviously being placed precisely because of the potential threat to the Olympics.

Whether we should be hosting the Olympics isn't the issue here. There are going to be thousands of extra people in London for the games. I'd rather not spend the money on security but as I said before we are where we are and have to deal with it and make sure that people are safe. Whatever the reasons for the motives behind any attack you have to admit that the Olympics in London make a great target. You seem to be suggesting we have unarmed police along with an unspecified but small number of ""well trained teams"" in place, based on your unsourced risk assessment.

Well... Back to the saying ""offence is taken not given""... I can't really say what the unions felt exactly. A friend of mine, for example, got very annoyed with the way the BBC initially reported the story. The headline and initial text implied that Clarkson had been somewhat out of line. Then he watched the video (with even a little bit of context) and realised what Clarkson meant/said/did.

Which is why I think that the unions should have seen the original before commenting. Either way they were wrong, in my opinion. If they hadn't watched the original, or seen the whole transcript: They're numpties. If they saw it and still think they had a point: they're numpties.

But offence in context in general - If for example Clarkson *had* meant it... Well I can see both sides of the coin.

The fact that other people haven't posted comments like yours does not mean they're all intimidated and afraid.  They may simply not share your opinion.  Similarly, even if they agree with you, they may feel it's not worth their time and energy to post about it, choosing to simply downvote the OP instead.

It's important to remember that your opinions are yours, and yours alone.  Just because your opinion might be unpopular does not mean there's a ""massive problem on the subreddit"".  Nor does it mean that your opinion is the only thoughtful, intelligent one out there.  The approximately 78 percent of readers who gave this post an upvote have an opinion that's just as valid, and correct, as yours.",0,1332776770,null,0,true,0,c453yka,t3_rd7g5,t1_c453yka,t1_c450lai,null,1428596678,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

every week my local paper for my tiny district has over 300 jobs, the MEN constantly has over 1000 jobs, I've just called my sister in law who runs a mid-large recruitment firm, they currently have over 2000 jobs....

Tesco have already said they are creating thousands of jobs this year, Mc Donalds are always hiring.

so as it stands, 50'000 on one website, there are lots of websites around many will have duplicate jobs, but lets just say across all job sites there will be at least 100'000 individual jobs.

One recruitment agency I have spoken to has 2000, lets say only 300 of those are none duplicated across job sites, multiply that by how many large recruitment companies there are in the UK, even if you said every recruitment site only had 50 jobs, thats still a lot.

A small daily paper in my tiny district has 300+ every week, manchester has 1000+, how many counties are there in the UK? each with a collection of newspapers advertising local jobs.

And thats not counting the hundreds and hudreds of jobs creating by people like tesco and mcdonalds.

Then you have a further group or council and NHS jobs that aren't advertised on independent jobs sites.

Then you have every single armed force and any jobs they have going.

Then also the little jobs that people just put a wanted sign in the window for, yeah maybe it's only 1000 across the entire country, but they are still there.

Breaking it up into episodes... (these are in no particular order)

**EPISODE ONE***

Note that at 0:20, as the Doctor says ""Run!"" Amy is wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt, behind her is a P.I. lookin' guy with a flashlight, then to her right is Rory and trailing in the back is Arthur Weasley.

The strangest thing is that to the Doctor's right in this scene is a woman dressed as a pharaoh. Note the Doctor's red tie.

At 0:24 we see Amy running in the same blue-and-white striped shirt, clearly she is being chased.

Later in 0:24 we see the Lady Pharaoh running ahead being followed by the P.I. (carrying the same flashlight) and Arthur Weasley along with a male running behind her. If I were to hazard a guess I'd say this is Rory, but it just as easily could be the Doctor.

We see at 0:25 Rory, the Doctor, and Arthur dashing along a bleak and rocky shore. By the way they're looking behind them they seem to be being chased.

0:26. The Doctor is sliding on what appears to be dust in the same temple they were in.

0:53, we see Rock-Em Sock-Em Robots emitting sparks. These same robots can be seen almost immediately after behind the hunched figure of Argus Filch.

Almost immediately later we see Argus Filch (notice the scarring on the right side of his face, the fact that he's wearing leather and fur, and the gold earring on his right lobe) jabbing a thing around the Lady Pharaoh's neck that throttles her.

We see Amy, still in the blue-and-white striped shirt with a gun standing back-to-back with some other dude with a gun. The guns appear to be futuristic or alien.

At 1:01 we see the Doctor and probably Rory fascinated by the Rock-Em Sock-Em robots while Arthur looks behind them as if he's just noticed they've been caught.

There could 2,000,000 jobs available and we could still have declining employment. It's pretty hard to find public numbers on this, but the job creation rate was only just positive for most of last year, and possibly was below the required rate in order to just tread water in terms of overall employment.

Your dad was lucky he could get such a job. The person that first sprung to mind when I thought about this is epileptic, so that rules him out of any driving jobs, and most that involve any vaguely dangerous machinery.

And half those ""opportunities"" you see in local newspapers etc? Most of them are scams, typically trying to convince you to pay £200 in admin fees. I'm having to watch my brother go from scam interview to scam interview. If it's a real interview he doesn't get through the door - middle aged and handicapped.

Anyway, there's certainly no evidence (at least you have provided none, and I don't know of any) that people not dressing according to traditional work environments is leading to an overall decrease in employment. Let alone the idea that there's enough jobs for everyone if they weren't so lazy. For that to be the case there would have to be a sustained level of greater than 3 million unfilled vacancies with the majority of those positions requiring minimal skills.

RTD didn't just kill off the Time Lords, he made the Doctor *old.* He's always been old compared to his companions, but not to himself and other Time Lords. At least from the 2nd Doctor on he was the (relatively) young rebel in exile, against what to him was the ancient and rigid Time Lord authority. He was self-consciously childish, the anti-soldier, with an attitude of assumed immortality that he doesn't have anymore.

Now he is the ancient Time Lord authority, the only one left. The war turned him first into a soldier and then into a shell-shocked veteran who killed his own species. There's no one left for him to rebel against, except maybe reality itself. And after genocide against his own species, there aren't many limits left to what he could do.

And he was never much of a family man, but he theoretically had one. He doesn't anymore, he killed them along with everyone else.

Much as some fans might like to dismiss us as such, we're not some no history team - first club to make the English league and cup double, 8 FA Cup and 4 League Cup wins, more European trophies than any other club in London, including the first European trophy won by an British club, not to mention the birthplace of the one-two, push-and-run football, arguably the foundation of the modern game, under Rowe.

We finish third and we'll have no trouble translating that into attracting big players - finish fourth and I still don't see too much trouble, especially if you throw an FA Cup win into the mix - we're arguably favourites right now.

I think you overestimate the financial head start Chelsea/City/United will have in the coming years - FFP is in place now and people aren't taking it into account enough. The next couple of years should be very good to Spurs and Arsenal as a result. Our relatively low wage bill and lack of need for any squad investment for more than two years leaves us in a very promising position. We also have several players on their way out who will fetch a transfer kitty of some 30 million to add to whatever else we're able to invest. 

We won't lose any players we don't want to this summer, unless we lose out on CL qualification. Modric wants to stay in London and won't be heading to a Chelsea with no CL on offer just for the money. Bale has a good head on his shoulders and won't go anywhere for at least a season or two yet, he's still only 22.

We're ahead of Chelsea right now, and have enough money to keep things that way - same could be said of Arsenal, though that's a far closer comparison which they may just edge. Neither of those teams are going to be able to massively outmatch us in bids for players this summer (and Arsenal likely wouldn't even if they could). You'd have to be delusional to think we're that far behind the other big clubs - a couple of good signings this summer and we're realistically title contenders.

The next two years the PL is going to be all about Manchester and North London. Interesting times.

p.s. although obviously still hugely well respected, Arsenal haven't been one of the great teams for a while now - they've some work ahead to get back to that level.

From the perspective of the religious conservatives? The aborted foetus who is no longer going to get to grow into a person? Hell, I agree with them on that one, I just don't think it matters. I also don't think reducing the population is all that necessary, the ""native"" population in the UK is already at only slightly more than about replacement levels. (Thanks in large part to a woman's right to control over her reproductive health)Long term our population should be fairly stable and the growth will be sustainable given a steady advancement of technology.

true,tophatstuff,null,null,"It was forcefully broken up by police. I have a copy of one of the protester's recent statement to the press, bit of a long read but quite shocking:


Last November 11th I was part of a peaceful demonstration by Occupy Cardiff here on the green outside Cardiff Castle. 


We were putting up some tents as part of the world-wide Occupy movement to protest against the inequality and injustice of the financial systems where billions of pounds are spent to bail out failed banks and pay fat bonuses to the 1% of the population who are super-wealthy, while of the rest us, the 99%, are made to pay for the crisis through lost jobs, and deep cutbacks in people’s wages, pensions and the public services we all rely on like the National Health Service.


Our protest was completely peaceful, in fact there was a happy, almost holiday atmosphere about it at first. People were glad to be doing something together to stand up against what this appalling Tory and Lib Dem government is doing. We took special care to make sure we did no damage to the Castle grounds.


Despite this, in the pouring rain the police presence built up and up. We were alarmed to see they were armed with Tasers. As the evening wore on the police moved in on the protest and broke it up, forcing the demonstrators off the Castle green and kettling them in the subway over there. They did this with some considerable violence, one of us was punched in the stomach, a legal observer was injured when a mounted officer rode his horse at her. Six of us were arrested. I was bruised when they wrenched my hands behind my back to hand-cuff me. Throughout this I want to emphasise, we offered only completely non-violent resistance, linking arms to avoid being pushed away from our tents.


After being arrested, I was kept in solitary confinement for over six hours before being released. Although I was only 17 years old at the time, they not only failed to inform my parents of my arrest but refused to let my Dad see me to check I was alright when he did find out what had happened and came to Butetown Police Station to bring me home. Whilst being held I was subjected to disturbingly intrusive and inappropriate questioning about my gender status, and whether or not I had had “the operation”, questioning which had no bearing on the alleged crime I was being charged with. This questioning made me feel really unsafe, upset, and angry. The police must be told loud and clear that this kind of treatment of transgender people is totally unacceptable and we won’t let them get away with it. I am taking advice from my solicitors about possible legal action against the police over this and other issues to do with my time in their custody.


So the result of this was that myself and one other were charged under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act with “failing to leave the land, namely CARDIFF CASTLE, as soon as reasonably practical”.  We were to appear at Cardiff Magistrates Court on Wednesday February 8th 2012. We learned that if convicted we could face a maximum sentence of three months imprisonment. On the hearing on 8th March, the Magistrate, despite scathing comments at the lack of preparation of the Crown Prosecution Service and South Wales Police, set a date in June for our trial. Sorry, that should be three dates in June – yes a three day trial for what actually? – peacefully exercising our right to protest on publicly owned land!


The Tories and their hangers-on in government tell us that we live in an age of austerity – apparently this doesn’t apply to the state’s pursuit and prosecution of people who dare to stand up against to their policies though.


Last week, after a public campaign by Occupy Cardiff involving a petition both online and on the streets of Cardiff, Freedom of Information requests about the policing of November’s demo, lobbying Cardiff Council, letters in the Guardian and Welsh press signed by numerous Welsh Assembly Members, MPs, trade unionists, and church people including the Archbishop of Wales, and many others, with plans for more pressure to come, I had a phone call from my solicitors saying that the CPS had dropped the case - we had won!


What is the importance of this case in the wider context? This was the first time Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act was used against protest in the UK. It wasn’t the last unfortunately. Since then it has been used to evict Occupy and other protests in cities elsewhere in the UK, and to evict travellers as well. At the moment, with increasing joblessness and poverty, it seems likely there will be much more protest and civil disobedience against what the government is doing. The government, elected councils like Cardiff, and the police will be faced with a choice of whether to use force to attack the right to protest as happened last November in Cardiff, or to let the people speak.


When Occupy Cardiff said this case was “an assault on everyone’s rights to express ourselves publicly and peacefully protest”, we were clearly right. The police should never use this law to attack the right to democratic protest again, and I am pleased that members of the Welsh Assembly intend to investigate the case further with the idea of preventing any repetition in Wales.",0,1332788126,null,0,false,0,c4565g6,t3_r9aht,t1_c4565g6,t1_c44jdkc,null,1428597716,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2

* Policies are voted on by the community, who unlike traditional political parties, are not aligned to any one particular ideology.

Check.

* Leaders, representatives, and positions are voted democratically from people who put themselves forward.

Check (using STV).

* We don't accept donations from businesses at all. We only accept macro level payments to support the party.

I am fairly confident that PPUK has never taken a donation from a business. But IAN the Treasurer so can't say definitively.

* Core ideas are collaboration, open source, participation, evidence based policy and resource efficiency.

That's not really how it works either. We don't elect parties on an all-or-nothing basis, we elect individual MPs who hold principles in agreement with the policies of a particular party. We elect that MP on the understanding that they support such policies and will vote in support of them in Parliament.

Stand up for their principles and vote in Parliament in good conscience.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"Excellent quotation and a very interesting assessment. It's a poetic sort of description of both characters, but I think that it deserves a closer look.

The Doctor, to my mind, doesn't aspire to be human so much as he greatly admires them, but even ""admires"" is a tricky word, since he is occasionally very disparaging of or cynical towards the human race as well. It depends on the particular incarnation of the Doctor and how ""human"" that particular regeneration is, in part. If nothing else, I would say that the Doctor understands human nature very well. The Ninth and Eleventh Doctors definitely have much more of the alien aspect to the character, unlike the Tenth and the Eighth (going off the movie, at least, since I have yet to start in on any audio adventures) who are both filled with a joyful wonder at what humans are capable of.

On the other hand, Sherlock Holmes. Like the Doctor, we have to qualify a bit here - Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the most adapted character in literary history, and so there are a great number of interpretations of the character. As far as Moffat and Gatiss' BBC series is concerned, at least, I would say that again, Sherlock doesn't so much aspire to be a god as he aspires to be purged of humanity. But at the same time, he is undeniably connected to it and that gives him a strength that Mycroft does not possess. Their exchange in the morgue from ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is perhaps one of my favorite insights into the characters.

Sherlock sees humans as working very simply and mechanically, and since he is so easily able to predict their behavior, they are, to use both his and Moriarty's words, ""BORING!"" But the Doctor only feels this way at his most cynical, such as Nine's ""stupid apes!"" line, or Eleven upon discovering the Star Whale. More often, there is again a sense of wonder in the Doctor, allowing him to be pleasantly surprised by humanity's unpredictability.

This is, I think, the crux of the matter though many people won't necessarily realise it. Also the religious angle also has the aspect that society is openly accepting and legitimising gay *sex*, as to many people (and to an extent historically) marriage gives the OK to sex.

Legalising gay marriage is a step too far for many people - while they can tolerate gay people being allowed to be gay and be (almost) treated as normal members of society, they see the marriage aspect as an afront to the dignity and sanctity of marriage. These people are apparently ignorant (willfully or otherwise) of the history of marriage internationally and also nationally.

The point: In essence, it is. There's no evidence behind either remedy, except for some people assuming their god and religion is the default. The claims are both the same: No evidence, just anecdote.

Interference: Not really, no.

To choose a specific case - The Cancer Act 1939 is quite clear about claims regarding the curing of Cancer. Effectively (I believe) *no-one* can claim to cure cancer. Not even the medical profession. It's understandable as nothing we know of yet cures cancer in 100% of cases.

Given the proliferation of historical *and* modern groups who will claim to cure, but also have a string of bodies behind them - and I include the innocuous homeopathy in that - I don't think it's wrong to stop people from making claims that have the potential to make sick people worse. Some people are informed, yes, and understand that such and such won't cure their illnesses, but a feck of a lot of people have never taken a real interest in the sciences and see the buzz words or listen to the rhetoric, believe they're taking a viable alternative.

Just look at how many ""health"" shops sell 'detox' remedies and what not. Look at how popular and respected 'Dr' Gillian McKeith was until she was royally slapped by Dr Ben Goldacre et al.

There was a movie in the 90s in hopes of resuming the series, but it didn't catch on. Then, in 2005, the BBC took another crack at it with the new series, affectionately known as New Who. That's what's airing today. The new series is technically a continuation of the original show, but requires no knowledge of its predecessor. There are six series (or seasons) of New Who currently out, and a seventh is in the works for this August. I suggest you start at the beginning of New Who and watch through that before even thinking about taking on the old show, especially if you're not much for old movies. I hope this helps! Have fun!

Outside of those 3, there is no one good enough to generate the supply that Ronaldo would need to be as effective as he's been at Real Madrid.  

This is part of Nando's current problem.  There's still a disconnect in the offense, especially when anyone other than Lampard is in midfield.   Torres been forced to basically drop back and supply himself.  Between Mata getting shoved around like an 8th grader on one side and the black hole that is Sturridge on the other, it is a miracle Torres has actually even received the ball as much as he has.

The health services should be free at the point of delivery and available on the basis of need whether you are there because of a poor decision, because you have substance abuse issues, because you were doing some extreme sport or because you tried to top yourself and failed.  The moment you start describing some subgroup of people as time-wasters you bring in the notion that for some people it is OK to throw in a disincentive to get help, I don't like that. It's wrong.  

As to people with no medical need, well they end up a really low priority anyway and spending a night at A&amp;E, drunk or otherwise isn't exactly fun.  This shouldn't be handled by the health service, it's divisive, it will have a negative impact on people who are responsible and almost no impact on those who aren't anyway.  Using policing to deal with it seems far more reasonable, but lets leave the NHS providing care and the police doing the policing.

&gt;Actually for alcohol related injuries I agree with charging people but only if there injury is minor (cuts,scrapes,bumps and sprains) basically the sorts of injuries that could be treated by their GP the following Monday.

Just as a case in point here, who would you charge? Someone who is visibly drunk? Someone who has had  a pint or two? Someone who was utterly comatose but the injury isn't related to their state? If the issue is minor injuries taking up A&amp;E time then we need to make non-emergency care more easily available (Minor injuries units, GP's that have walk in appointments etc..), if drunkenness is that much of a problem then surely that is an issue for the police, local authorities and bars/supermarkets.

Starting to drop these kinds of thins into the NHS is abhorrent, it will start with drunks at A&amp;E and end up being broadened against any other group that it is fashionable to have a go at (Drug users, smokers, people who have unsafe sex, people who engage in extreme sports, fat people etc..) and we end up with a service that is free for some at best.

true,odd_ood,silence,Silence,"Beautiful.  I agree with you mostly.  In my interpretation of Holmes, I see him as striving for perfection.  He is always keeping track of his failures, and the few he does have weigh heavy on his mind at times.  Holmes sees that humanity is predictable and so bogged down in their ways.  Studying human behavior to death, he realizes that it is all the same, over and over and over again.  But when you take a step back from Holmes' mind, at look at how Watson sees him, I can agree that Holmes might be the ""most human"" person.  Watson sees Holmes as someone who observes human behavior and tries to avoid it, but succumbs  to it every time.  Holmes has the most predictable behavior ever.  Probably even more so than the criminals he studies. 

Holmes even has a passion for protecting human life.  He even states that his only failures are the ones where his client's life was lost before the case was solved.  I think Holmes sees himself as still human, but above the rest.  He sees things that to him, are common but to the rest of us seem so strange to even look at.  I believe he sees the world in a different light, sees the trials and tribulations of his fellow man, and tries to rise above that and avoid what everyone else has fallen to.

He needs to be able to view himself through younger eyes, hence his series of young friends that help him to be what he so desires, human. 

And for Sherlock, for the most part, he just needs an audience to be smarter than. He needs the approval, and reassurance that he is indeed the best. I don't think it's out of cruelty though, I think it's because he's a Sociopath (that doesn't make him evil) and so separate from the rest of humanity and normalcy that he's lonely.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"octor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1332799253,null,0,false,0,c458gg7,t3_reqej,t1_c458gg7,t3_reqej,null,1428598886,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Our shows start in the fall in September/October and then run up to Thanksgiving (end of November). Then they take a ""mid-season break"" and come back about six weeks later / mid January. In fact, that break may be longer this year due to the winter Olympics.

If Doctor Who is now aligning itself with the US prime time schedules, expect them to have the same approximate airing schedule.

US TV scheduling is generally during the portion of the year when people are more likely to be inside due to colder / poorer weather conditions - and after the school year starts back up - with a break between Thanksgiving and the New Year due to it essentially being one huge celebration / extended holiday, when sitting down in front of a TV is the last thing you do (with the Thanksgiving parade (and now the dog show after it) being the last thing anyone can be guaranteed to watch).

true,MacSquizzy,null,null,"Well the season doesn't start until September but Murrayfield (Edinburgh) is generally open all year round without the ice being lifted (this happens at some rinks) but it's a far cry from any modern rinks you may have seen. The rink was built in 1942 and is the second oldest still used rink in the UK, the older being Fife Ice Arena in Kirkcaldy from 1938.

The question about a goalie in Scotland is actually a good one. It depends on your skill level. By the sounds of it you have some pretty good experience and would be above most reccy teams so would be looking at the higher level of them or perhaps even SNL but they have rules against number of non UK players. 

In the UK the highest level league is the Elite league, comprising teams from all four countries. Generally the highest calibre of player is AHL with former ECHL, CHL and former Junior players with Europeans thrown in for good measure. The next level down in Scotland is SNL with teams in Edinburgh, Fife and many other places.

A good thing to do would be youtube some Fife Flyers or Edinburgh Capitals and compare yourself against this level so we can look at what level you would be best suited to over here. My team are generally more beginners to the sport mixed in with some experienced reccy players but you would barely have to face the centre ice to stop our shots!

I would link some highlights myself but my wee laptop is beyond slow so it is freezing up.

There's literally *nothing left*. There is nothing to do with River. There's no space in her past for adventures, and trying to bring her back to life would spit on Silence of the Library and all the meaning her death had.

control over how their health services were run.

maternity wards and accident and emergency departments – keep being
closed, even though local people desperately want them to stay open. People
often struggle to get convenient access to GP services, and poorer areas are
less well served by the NHS, contributing to widening health inequalities.

We will change this by:

* Sharply reducing centralised targets and bureaucracy, replacing
them with entitlements guaranteeing that patients get diagnosis and
treatment on time. If they do not, the NHS will pay for the treatment
quality care for all patients to be provided privately.

* Putting front-line staff in charge of their ward or unit budgets,
and allowing staff to establish employee trusts giving them real involvement and a say over how their service is run.

&gt; To try and apply the Cancer Act here looks like witch hunting.

I wasn't applying it was the case with regards to HOTS etc, but I was making the point that the ASA/state can interfere in general with respect to healing claims. Sure, Bath HOTS weren't saying (explicitly) that they/their god can heal cancer, but similar groups have in the past. That there are laws against healing claims was what I was getting at.

You might have been talking specifically about HOTS in general. So [what did the ASA say](http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/2/Healing-on-the-Streets_Bath/SHP_ADJ_158433.aspx):

&gt; ...we were concerned that the prominent references in ad (b) to healing and the statement ""You have nothing to lose, except your sickness"" in combination with the references to medical conditions for which medical supervision should be sought... could give consumers the expectation that, by receiving prayer from HOTS volunteers, they would be healed of the conditions listed or other sicknesses from which they suffered. We also considered that the testimonials in ad (a) could also give consumers that expectation, and furthermore, noted that a video on the website also made claims that HOTS volunteers had successfully prayed for healing for people with cancer, fibromyalgia, back pain, kidney pain, hip pain, cataracts, arthritis and paralysis.

(interesting - there was an implication that cancer specially could be healed)

&gt; ...we noted we had not seen evidence that people had been healed through the prayer of HOTS volunteers, and concluded that the ads could encourage false hope in those suffering from the named conditions and therefore were irresponsible.

The interference from the state/ASA was justified, I think, as they felt that HOTS were promoting a non-proven healing method in such a way as to potentially cause harm.

It is due to the lack of evidence for efficacy that, though there are some exceptions, homeopathic remedies have to carry something like this label (I believe):

Something that a mate of mine pointed out to me the other day is that it's not just the team that is learning, it's Kenny, too. The game has changed so much in the decade he was away from football and there is a learning curve to be expected. That's not to say that he isn't up to the task, I think he is, and what gives me more confidence is that I think that these owners seem more than willing to surround him with the sort of people that will help his transition.

I think the way we set the league alight upon his appointment last season was largely due to the relief that was brought to the team from the departure of Hodgson and H&amp;G.

The good in humanity is something that could be spread all around the universe, but at the same time, we have the capability and the means to be just as vile and despicable as we can be great. The Doctor, I think, recognizes this capability for good and horrid in our race and tries with all his might to celebrate the good, the fantastic, the brilliant about us to remind us to seek that out in ourselves and others around us. It's one of the beautiful things about the show that has made me grow to love it. 

Sherlock however lives here, he doesn't have the ability to see all aspects of the universe, so the basis of all of his judgements on humanity is limited to one scope. He is a higher intellect among those on this planet, but he has never had the chance to see what humanity is able to overcome and what humanity is able to build (supposing for a second that the two universes are one in the same for the sake of comparison). I would agree that Sherlock isn't necessarily trying to become a god, but merely wanting to become less flawed (or to be purged of humanity to use your phrasing, which is quite well put I might add). 

As for Watson's line of Sherlock being the ""most human"" person he had ever met, I would say that this goes back along the same lines of thinking which the Doctor uses (appropriate that it should be a quote from a man who is also a doctor). I think Watson means that Sherlock is striving to become the best of what humanity can offer, though this could be confused as me stating that Sherlock is trying to become the ""perfect"" human. Not at all the case actually. What I mean to say, though I'm having a fit of doing adequate work of it, is that Sherlock's understanding of how humans work and interact is perhaps the reason he is the best humanity has to offer. To put it differently, if there was someone I could vote to represent humanity to other planets and galaxies, I think Sherlock would be our man. He gets us, or at least understands us at a level most of us wish we could attain. So, in that sense, he is the ""most human"" person.

Your question: Oh right sorry!

I think Mitchell would say the Limbaugh apology would be ""the right thing to do"" because the sentiment was so fecking awful, but that it would be pointless because Limbaugh meant every word he said. In that sense, demanding an apology is silly as all it does it allow Limbaugh to mouth platitudes to satisfy people who may not realise that it's not ""all OK now because he said sorry."" It still leaves the problem that the gobshite is talking crap to so many people without proper recourse. Having said that, an apology from Limbaugh would show some people in his audience that 'maybe his ideas aren't so great'?

Dear Sirs, 

I am writing to you with regard your joint complaint against the Advertising Standards Authority, who ruled on the Healing On The Streets Ministry, in Bath, using the words ""NEED HEALING? GOD CAN HEAL TODAY!"" in a recent leafleting campaign.

It is my understanding, from an article posted to totalpolitics.com on 26 Mar 2012, that the all-party Christians in Parliament group in Westminster, have asked the ASA to produce ""indisputable scientific evidence to say that prayer does not work"", and that should they fail to do this you intend to raise the matter in Parliament.

I would like to draw your attention to several studies on intercessory prayer which have been carried out over many years — specifically those of sociologist Wendy Cadge, who evaluated eighteen published studies conducted between 1965 and 2006.  No evidence for the efficacy of prayer, as an aid to healing — beyond the placebo effect — was found.  

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090617154401.htm

In that light, and since it is your claim despite the scientific evidence that God can in fact ""heal"", I therefore invite you to present indisputable scientific evidence for Yahweh's basic existence — taking care to note that Kant's Transcendental Argument and the Kalam Cosmological Argument have both been falsified.

On a personal note, I would also like to stress my deepest disgust, that public servants have nothing better to spend tax payer's money on, in these times of economic hardship, than asking the ASA to endorse magic.  People who do not seek professional treatment for serious illnesses, because they are told by those in authority to believe wishful thinking is more effective than medial science, die in their hundreds every year.  

Your actions, which appear to paper over this fact, are not only deeply irresponsible, they are an insult to the intelligence of your electorate.  We do not need United Kingdom politics cluttering up with American style mumbo jumbo about iron age myths.  I am therefore writing separately to all three party leaders, as well as my constituency MP, to complain in the strongest possible terms as to your conduct as public servants.  I have also contacted each of your local newspapers, that your employers can judge for themselves if this is an appropriate use of your time and their money.

I look forward to your prompt reply.

 If our government truly represented what the country wants do you think they would be making all of the unpopular choices they are now? Does the average Brit really support NHS reform?

true,tophatstuff,cnty-wales,Swansea,"Stuff *has*, to an extent, happened.

In 2010, we had massive [student protests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_UK_student_protests).

Last year we had the [March for the Alternative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_London_anti-cuts_protest) with up to 500,000 people on the streets of London, the historic strike of 2 million on November 30th, and the repeat of the [Jarrow march](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15607103). Lets not forget complete riots in London.

Why haven't we had anything over the NHS? Primarily because Unite the union are shit and organised an indoor rally with limited places on a weekday to ""Save the NHS"". If the TUC had organised a weekend demonstration you would have seen a few million out again.

What next? PCS are building for a coordinated national strike in April, and by then Unite and FBU members will have balloted or have decided on joining in, so we could see another massive strike, possibly of 48 hours. This would have been on the 28th (tomorrow) if the NUT hadn't bottled it at the last second. It's still on in London.

In London, the leaders of the more militant trade unions are openly standing against Labour, the Tories, etc. as part of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC). RMT voted to allow branches to financially back TUSC -- this could be the start of a real alternative workers' party. PCS is also about to vote on using their political funds to back or stand candidates in elections directly.

**tldr; big strikes in April, credible alternative to New Labour emerging.**

The Doctor didn't learn every language in existence. More likely that countless eons of a symbiotic relationship with the TARDIS has caused the doctor to develop his own biological translation circuit. 

Evidence of this -

In The Time of Angels when the TARDIS lands the Doctor goes for the door but is stoped by River who says they need to do a environment check using the TARDIS computer console. The Doctor just sticks his head out the door and is able to determine what planet they are on, where in the system they are located, what sort of radiation levels there are and can even determine the weather. 

It is ridiculous that any living thing could do this (there are countless planets in the universe, no one could know all of them just by smelling the air) so it is more likely that the TARDIS has indeterminately altered the Doctor's physical capabilities.

5) TARDIS appears before him after Sally sends it back; gets in and continues travels.

I do think that Matt Smith was chosen as a bit of a stunt cast. He was chosen because he was the youngest, and I think that's to his detriment. He's obviously got the talent, but I don't think he has the experience to really refine it into a skill.

In some scenes where he has to channel into himself and find emotion, he ends up betraying how young he really is. From his tantrum with the Daleks in Victory of the Daleks to his ""Colonel Runaway"" speech in A Good Man Goes to War, Smith just ends up coming off as more inexperienced and childish (which itself is partially exacerbated by the more bumbling portrayal of the Doctor Smith's been given).

However this is far from ruining the character for me. Most actors take time to settle into their roles (we really lucked out when we got Eccleston and Tennant, as they owned the roles almost immediately). Usually it's by the third season in that actors really get a hold of their characters and start giving their best performances (see TNG and many others).

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I actually think his companions (Amy, specifically) really weigh the Doctor down. Many of his best episodes (The Lodger, Closing Time, The Doctor's Wife) are episodes where Amy's mostly out of his hair.

Frankly Karen Gillian's acting leaves so much to be desired and stays within such a limited range (somewhere between indignant and bossy) that everyone else is dragged down when they have to deal with her (which is unfortunately often).

Rory bears the worst of this. Arthur Darvill shows clear promise as an actor (still possesses a fairly limited range, but moreso than Karen) but has only two roles in the show: being bossed around by Amy or saving Amy's ass.

River is an obviously capable actor, inarguably the most accomplished out of the three and she can obviously act complex and deeply emotional scenes (Silence of the Library can clearly attest to that, she manages to convey this pained sadness at having so much to say, but not being able to say it.

People hate on it for being silly, but unlike RTD's missteps where he's *way* too silly this one *admits it*. This one goes back through Doctor Who and points out how utterly ridiculous everything is for the normal Joe Schmo living in Doctor Who London.

Point being that it was genuinely funny and allowed a nice pull away from typical Doctor time with a sort of madcap bizarreness that I honestly wished the show wouldn't be so afraid of tapping into.

I suppose the humor, like the video diary cutting to Elton John or the whip-pans or the ""Doctor What?"" stuff was just in line with a style of humor I can appreciate. I feel that this episode is hated on for all the wrong reasons, and it's really a good episode that I will defend to the end.

Also, Partners in Crime. It's not exactly hated, but not a lot of people mention it around here. It's one of my favorites because it's one of the few episodes in Tennant's run that genuinely kept me in stitches throughout.

But some of the criticism against him at the end of his Tottenham job was probably well founded. I've read that only about 50% of transfers work out and he certainly had some mistakes. Gomes, Taarabt, David Bentley, Corluka, and (probably) dos Santos all have fell out of favour with the club for falling below expectations. So, obviously, he's not infallible and it would be silly to think that all of his purchases will be successes. Only time will tell and I am not of the opinion that any of ours can yet be called ""bad"" buys. Charlie Adam, for all the grief he has gotten, played some pretty decent football when paired with Lucas. Since then, he's obviously struggled, but considering his cost and being out of position, I think he's done okay. Henderson, whom most people seem most optimistic about, for me, still has a lot to learn and those who think he will be the next Gerrard will probably be disappointed. Of course, I would love to be proven wrong.

true,douchebag_karren,rose,Rose,"not quite what you were asking for, but I just watched Vincent and the Doctor today, and I didn't cry at all. I'm not saying I disliked it one bit, I just didn't cry. I think it's because I knew that even after all the doctor had done for him, he would have the same fate in the end... my hopes never rose like Amy's did. I think I was a lot more sad at the end of Day of the Moon, when River realizes that its the doctor's first kiss, and that she'll never get to kiss him again... I didn't cry but it seemed so much more hopeless. 

Also- because Blink was so hyped to me, I was not very impressed with it. Nor was I scared, and I didn't cry (I guess people did, but I'm not quite sure what part people would be crying for). It was alright, the best part being when they sit down and watch the video all the way through, otherwise it was just sort of Meh, to me. 

I liked New Earth, because I love Cassandra, and I love the Face of Boe, I didn't even know people didn't like this one. I think the body jumping Cassandra was played fabulously by Tennant and Piper. 

And I'm not sure if people like Boom Town or not, there seems to be a push against the Slithine, I absolutely loved them, and Loved Boom Town, It's the first time the doctor realizes that Bad Wolf is following them, and we get to have the nature/nurture argument, and in the end, the tardis gives her another shot, by making her an egg again.

And more to come.

But, alas, I won't be there to see all of it.  I'll watch until the end of my days, but it'll grow more and more difficult.

If white guys insult me by saying you ""yellow cunt"" or ""brown cunt"", I would mad of course, but not because he uses my skin color, but because he called me ""cunt"", period. Now if my employer deny me equal right in the office because I was asian/yellow/brown/whatever, now I'm mad because my bos being a racist dick.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"To me, I think that Doctor Who is an inherently optimistic show, or should be, and that the Doctor is an inherently optimistic character. He is flawed and has moments of cynicism and coldness towards humanity, certainly, but I believe that at his core he is a character who cares deeply for humanity, understands us, and believes in us anyway. It's interesting to go back to the very earliest episodes and see how alien and harsh the Doctor is towards his first companions, and also heartwarming to watch him become more approachable. And in a similar way, the character arc for the Ninth Doctor is brilliant in the way it brings him back from a state of such manic cynicism to being unwilling to destroy the Earth himself, and even willing to sacrifice himself to save a single life - quite the turnabout from ""stupid apes"" indeed.

And to my mind, the Ninth Doctor's regeneration is by far one of my favorite scenes in the show and encapsulates so much of what I think the Doctor is about. He is dying, but he wants to reassure his companion; whatever else has happened, it's been ""fantastic."" Even in this moment of dying and being reborn, the Doctor is such a life-affirming character (which we first really begin to see in the ""Everyone lives!"" moment I mentioned above).

So an optimist, and also a humanist, and also fundamentally curious and in awe of the universe. I think that Eleven's line that [""I can't see it anymore""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=005hhOPMK4U) is interesting and really reflects how old the character is becoming, but I'm also ever so in love with Ten's eternal sense of wonder, and Eleven's nuanced view, in which he has to be reminded that there is so much [""more to see than can ever be seen""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjz-ynF2o34) (and yes, I know that was Ten's line). And finally, ""the man who makes people better."" That was a brilliant bit of writing, and very much describes Eccleson's Doctor (see also Rose's line about what the Doctor showed her, and not just aliens and spaceships and things), at least.

These are general characteristics that I believe the Doctor continuously embodies, across his regenerations. That being said, then, I also like seeing the much more alien side to the Doctor, which serves to remind us that he really isn't a tame lion after all. I'm not the biggest fan of Dark!Doctor, but I think that Eccleson's edge gave the role just the right gravitas; the moment at the end of ""Bad Wolf"" when he jumps up and promises to save Rose? Another favorite bit for me, the way that Eccleson is juggling so many emotions in that moment.

And finally, that the show is about the underlying uncertainty that continues to exist, no matter how much we have seen or learned about the life, the universe, and everything. Whether the genre is historical, futuristic, comedy, or anything else, I love coming away from an episode and feeling as though there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in my philosophy. The end of the very first season of Doctor Who concludes with William Hartnell stating ""Our lives are important — at least to us — and as we see, so we learn... Our destiny is in the stars, so let's go and search for it."" And that's just fantastic. (And I really wish I could find a video clip of the moment!)

It's easy to create a laundry list of policies that any government in recent history has pursued against the wishes of a large minority if not majority of people. Labour had wars, privatisation, civil liberties and PFI to name just a few.

The problem is that we elect people who to make these decisions for us. The public can't vote on every policy and nor should they, government just wouldn't work. However because of the way people become entrenched in voting for a single party their entire lives then the political parties know they will always have a core vote no matter what they do.

They can keep ignoring us until the opposition party has managed to make themselves electable, but this can take some time. Look how many times Labour got relected after the shit they pulled because the Tories were unelectable. In the end Labour had to almost ruin the country in order to push enough people to vote Tory.

So how do we change this? That is a tough question, obviously changing a political process this established will not happen overnight. But one thing is for sure, that we need to get everyone working together to achieve it and I think that is where we fail.

To revist my diving footballers analogy I made in another post, ask anyone if they think allowing players to behave this way is good for the game and I'm sure the vast majority will say no. But does it drive them to stop going to games? Stop buying football shirts? Stop paying for Sky Sports? No, they keep going because they accept it as something they can't change.

As far as I know, it's never been clearly explained how the Master managed to overcome vaporization, but it might be in one of the comics or audios. I haven't gotten to them yet, but there are a few people here who know them pretty well and could tell you.

The Eye of Harmony is technically a controlled black hole on Gallifrey that was used to power TARDISes and various other things on the planet, and the first time it's seen is in ""The Deadly Assassin"". There it's a black obelisk hidden underneath the Panopticon. For whatever reason, the writers of the movie decided to stick one in the Cloister Room, but it's mostly ignored or seen as a replica of the one on Gallifrey, not a true power source.

Not that I've seen. The Master was able to hypnotize, but the movie is the only place I've seen quite a bit of what they stuck in there. Fun fact: Bruce's body was meant to deteriorate over time because a human body can't hold a Time Lord consciousness without falling apart, but the makeup was too uncomfortable for Eric Roberts, so aside from the fingernail thing, they did away with it.

The Sonic Screwdriver was destroyed during the Fifth Doctor's run. The producer at the time, Jonathan Nathan-Turner (the *lovely* man who decided that the Doctor should have very pointless and meta question marks all over his costume) felt that the Sonic was a deus ex machina device and was causing the writers to become lazy because it allowed them to just write a new use for the Sonic in instead of coming up with a clever way for the Doctor to get out of a trap. So it stayed destroyed and the first time it was seen again was the movie. The Eighth Sonic you saw was made not too long ago, when McGann decided he wanted his own and also changed his Doctor's costume.

Secondly, it's depressing how easily people are led to think in only the most closed off ways. I see it in my own friends, even my own father, who's a very intelligent man. I'm starting to win him round a bit. Not in the sense of converting him to any forward thinking ideals, but at least to realise that the Daily Mail is mostly just bad journalism. It's a start. But a lot of people are like this; very fearful of the outside world. It seems to be just a natural mindset that is easily manipulated. It's a crying shame, but when 49% of people are below average intelligence, there's not a great deal you can do about that. It is very hard to reason out of someone, beliefs that were not reasoned into them. It takes a strong person to break free of those beliefs, and it takes people stronger than I am to help break a lot of people from those beliefs.

Some people are just too sensitive on some subjects and that's the reason why a compromise can never be met, because someone has an opinion that touches the surface of an opinion that opposes theirs they call them irrelevant names.


I thought reddit was a place where mostly liberal minded people allowed for meaningful debate without forcing their views on others, but in this thread if you're speaking anywhere NEAR against gay 'marriage' (Which if you read all my posts, I'm not) you are insulted and shunned as a bigotted right wing conservative.

Everything from our relatively good education system, how money works, to the hegemony that is the media (inclusive of institutions like the BBC and Newscorp) all work together to create intellectual or economic prisons.

I feel there must be some force that makes for a more egalitarian society by emergence. I cannot see anything 'willed' into existence governed by logical restraints like laws, helping, because they are easily rewritten or ignored. And of course it would require those with power to give some of that up. There needs to be an outside force incorruptible by the few, some sort of apolitical disruptive technology. (An easy example to make of this would be some magical teleportation device destroying the hegemony of the car, and thus oil dependence. We don't need laws banning cars because people will naturally use the teleport.)

I see the obsession with growth as a 'natural' fall-out from the interest based money supply, so that tells me we need a new form of money. Then once there is a level economic playing field then the political sphere way naturally correct. If not then we can introduce another disruptive technology.

I don't fall for the left/right paradigm, it's the same thing: the left want to centralise power and call it 'the state' (or 'the union') and the right want to centralise power and call it 'the free market' (or corporation), but I understand why the right seems to win out. They use force and practical application, where as the left likes to occupy a more intellectual space and be morally correct, write nice books, read the Guardian, quaff wine over juicy conversation. I may even believe that there is no such divide between the right and the left, there's just a single power structure:

&gt; The Establishment's official landscape artists have done a marvelous job of painting a picture of Richard Nixon as a conservative. Unfortunately, this picture is twenty years out of date. The very liberal Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania boasted to a reporter one day: ""[Liberals] get the action and the Conservatives get the rhetoric."" Richard Nixon could not have been elected had he run as a Rockefeller liberal, but he can get away with running his Administration like one simply because the landscape painters fail to call the public's attention to the fact. [*'None Dare Call it a Conspiracy'*, 1971].

Even Noam Chomsky called Nixon: ""in many respects the last liberal president"". The book referenced is ridiculed as a conspiracy theorist's wet dream, but it is interesting to read it now, and replace Nixon with Obama.

When you privatise something there comes a point when the only means of increasing profits is to increase prices or decrease services. Correlation isn't the same as causation, but there is a trend for  privatisation leading to greater costs: water, energy, and train services would be good examples. 

New rules it seems allow private companies to discriminate regarding types of treatment opting to cover the more profitable ailments. In that sense, there is the real danger that people will be pushed into private alternatives or have access to only a subset of treatments.

Project managers and executives need to know the nature and extent of key project risks and automatically publicising the risk register in a project like this could a) dissuade some project users/suppliers from fully reporting potential risks and b) lead to a constant fire-fighting exercise when opponents can seize on every potential risk as if it's a reason to halt or cancel the project.

Not to say that the NHS project here isn't utterly flawed, but wanting to keep the risk register from being a public football isn't the failing. They set off without a clear business case and without a clear buy-in from stakeholders, and they've utterly failed to define fundamental products in sufficient detail (i.e. commissioning groups). This project failed before it was started, as they made the classic project management mistake of embarking on a project without a clear idea where they were headed or why and without getting everyone on board first. But that's politics, I guess.

If anything, I'd say the scandal with this risk register is that it seems very insubstantial; there should be more risks, documented in more detail (and perhaps there are given that we don't know this is complete or even the real thing).

Stuff happens that is political insofar as it relates to the world of politics even if the actors or forces are not being consciously political.

The circumstances that led to gangs of youth to run rampage through London are political. Fundamental dysfunction in our society which is creating an increasingly marginalised underclass plus a random event, in this case the shooting by police of a person, triggered an event that can't be fully explained by rational means but can be easily seen as a symptom of broader problems. 

Why did this particular thing trigger riots? Why did certain people at this particular time reach critical mass and lose their inhibitions? What prevents the same people from rioting every night? Why did the police fail to act appropriately? Can the police ever act appropriately? Why did the residents of Chiswick not riot while the residents of Tottenham rioted? Would people who felt happy, empowered and safe abandon all restraints to go and smash Argos? Should those of us who feel happy and empowered and safe actually go and smash Argos? Why should everything be smashed? Should nothing be smashed? Should groups of immigrant men from Dalston be responsible for policing London? 

I believe everything about the riots including the responses to them is political even though the people who participated were not being consciously political.

Is that a bit clearer? 

When you start rioting because you have been evicted from your home because the interest rates go back up to normal and suddenly half the population realises that they can't pay the mortgage, or your child is refused healthcare due to privatisation or you are struggling to pay for food because the price has gone up due to resource depletion you might not stop to think about articulating your grievance through placard waving or writing a letter to the Mail, you might be too pissed off.

The Conservatives won't destroy the NHS technically. They are giving the power to GPs who are not really ready or often willing to take on the job.

The GP comissioning is the positive side of the bill as GPs know their population's health needs better than most. The problem is that they can go to any willing provider. I guarentee you private healthcare firms are already buttering up GP groups especially in areas like London. Without serious long-term foresight what will happen is that they will undercut NHS hospitals for simple health procedures (let's say ear syringing or similar) and then the money for those procedures will not be in the NHS any more. Hospitals will need to downsize and it will be more difficult for them to afford to carry out the more complicated procedures. If enough money is taken out hospitals will close (and knowing hospital budgets from working with them it wouldn't take much). This is nothing to do with better management of funds it is simple economies of scale- the larger a hospital and the more staff the more it can do. At this point private firms will just take over. Also they will decide what is economical to provide and people with long term health conditions or seriously complicated diseases will lose out. They will fix the prices-NHS commissioners (GPs now) will have no way of setting the price as private firms will be the only option. I thought they were exactly the people who the NHS was set up to help. 

The commissioning support services that previously existed within the PCTs are also being put out to competition. This could be fine but they don't have the experience. They also will have access to lots of highly sensitive public information (patient details etc) and I have no doubt that even if they are only supposed to be doing what they are commissioned to do they will be using the information they have access to for their own agendas.

Alongside this there are massive budget cuts with an increasingly aging population, an obesity epidemic and lots of cancers. It's a disaster waiting to happen. I am mid-20s now and if it carries on like this by the time I'm old there will be no money left. 

Now I'm a FAT SOCIALIST WEASEL so I think that should come from taxing the rich but obviously the current government disagrees. Even a Robin Hood Tax is beyond them despite it's utter simplicity. Really we need a global plan to tax the rich where they can't just move their assets abroad to escape their obligations to the people who have not had the same opportunities as them for whatever reason.

Liberal, libertarian and right wing approaches are based around everyone grabbing what they can to spend on their personal happiness.  Depending on how it is governed that can mean a very few people being very comfortable or most people being quite comfortable.

The other approach is what I would call ""great projects"".  Putting a man into space and on the moon, building the NHS or the Pyramids, engagement in a Total War (like WW2) are all examples of this.  People accept less personally to achieve some great thing as a society.

We swing between the 2 as people insist on spending to much on themselves and let social issues build (so the refusal of most of the allied nations to engage with Germany and the rise of the Nazis until it was too late).  Then suddenly the shit hits the fan and people come together (defeat the Nazis and stay mostly on track fighting communism).

And around we go...

After Googling 'Tesco Mobile contacts' and finding a lot of Money saving expert forums that had posts mentioning people high up in the company, and also searching BBC News for mention of anyone who had a position in their Mobile arm of the business. Then formating the names to john.smith@tesco.com, I wrote out a very abrupt summary of the problems, the people whos imcompetance I had endured and then sent it off to them. Within a couple of hours I had repeated emails from CEO's PAs saying that they were very sorry and would make sure this was looked into, the refund was with me a couple of days later.

It appalls me that ineptitude leads to drastic measures like this, with any company. I find when calling the place that getting the person's full name leads them to be much more helpful as I then have a reference for complaining if they don't follow something up, in my experience.

&gt;New rules it seems allow private companies to discriminate regarding types of treatment opting to cover the more profitable ailments.  
  
Which new rules?  [This](http://www.supply2health.nhs.uk/AQPResourceCentre/Lists/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions/DispForm.aspx?ID=34) specifically addresses it, in particular, ""The Government made amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill so the prices paid to providers, under the national tariff, take account of the patients they treat and the services they offer - to ensure fair pay for providers.""  
  
I don't agree that it puts business and profitability first, but I do think there should have been (under this Government and the last) a national debate on how much we're willing to pay for the NHS.  An extra 2p on basic rate income tax, for example, specifically for the NHS would go a long way.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; This bill doesn't privatise the NHS, in so far as we will continue to pay taxes to the government.

That's the trick of privatisation. Indeed the NHS also is different from water, rail and such for because it has no vowels. Corporations is the state is corporations, is socialism, is fascism, is communism, is 'capitalism'. It's about rigging the market and making revenue streams law. An excellent quote:

&gt; [– private companies, lobbyists, pro-market think tankers – publicly praise the NHS, while taking incremental steps to turn it into an NHS in name only: a kitemark](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n18/james-meek/its-already-happened)

I'll admit I don't know what I am talking about regarding the NHS not only because it is such a complex issue but also because the sheer amount of propaganda leveraged to get it to this stage makes it immpossible. What I can see are the trends, and the Tory mentality and what it wants. I also know the opinion of the low salaried interests in this and how the government didn't want to invite them to the table. I don't think it unfair of me to distrust everything coming out of Cameron's mouth, especially considering the latest 250k cash for access corruption. The overwhelming noise coming from the dissenters coupled with the corporate-state behaviour is enough for me.

The same source as the previous quote goes into some detail:

&gt; The set tariff for treating a stroke might be calculated from the price of nine days being nursed in a ward at £170 a day, a couple of X-rays at £20 each, ten pathology tests at £6 each and six sessions of therapy for £235 – a total of £1865. If the hospital can treat the patient for £1600, it keeps the difference. The incentive to send the patient home as soon as possible is high.

There's your problem right there and in fact, it's not just your problem, it's sort of a global one. Basically, the west has reached a point where it has run out of ideas other than the status quo and until someone can come up with a concrete alternative, this situation will persist. In fact, this situation has got to the point of absurdity as the crash of 2008 made it quite clear just how broken the system was yet the left has nothing more to offer than tinkering (and I say this as someone who comes from the left). So it doesn't matter how much we (however rightly) whine about the unfairness of this or the injustice of that, unless you have a better idea that can be seen to work for a *majority* of people (and not just 20 somethings who happen to hang out on Reddit), then we will have to continue to suck it up.

Prison seems harsh for what is essentially name calling.

Of course certain sections of society need protecting from prejudice but do they need protecting from being called names or having people write nasty things about them ? 

Assault someone *because* they're black or gay or disabled ? I'm all for making the sentence more severe and making the reason for the attack an aggravating circumstance.

Call them names *because* they're black or gay or disabled ? I'm not so sure that the offence is aggravated, or even that an offence has been committed.

As Stephen Fry once said :

*So you’re offended by my sexuality? So fucking what?
So you’re offended by my use of vulgar language? So fucking what?
The fact that you’re offended is of no importance to me. I don’t derive my being from what you think of me. I derive it from what I think of me. And I like me. That’s all that matters.
And that’s all that should matter to you too. What you think of you.*

Why do I rank Tennant behind Smith?  He had some awesome episodes, but I found him a bit... emo.  By the time the End of Time rolled around, I was starting to think he really, really needed to regenerate already.  Yes, I know he had good reason to be sobbing on Wilf's shoulder, but I missed the fun times.

Matt brings the fun back.  Not to mention, he plays alien the best of any of them.  There's a guy I truly believe isn't human - he even seems uncomfortable in his own body.  And when he sobers up and gets angry, it's such a shock that it has real impact.  I like the way he plays trickster and clown, while all the while he's secretly thinking and plotting and planning and worrying.  I like that he lies and has secrets and isn't entirely trustworthy.

Tennant's Doctor was a nice guy, and rather hapless much of the time.  He would have died a half dozen times, or more, if it weren't for his friends and companions (and sometimes just luck).  I adored his run, and I loved the episodes he was in, but by the end I was glad to move on to Smith.  He seems more competent, even if he's not as pretty.

b) The price for delivery will triple

c) Service will not improve

d) Thousands of workers will be made unemployed

e) The private company will cut wages and services to increase profits

f) The taxpayer will still be liable for pensions and will still be liable for infrastructure and any losses. Gains go straight to share holders

g) It will be sold for less than it's value and in ten years we'll realise that we made bankers and shareholders instant millionaires for doing little more than buying shares.

h) Our choice of service will be as meaningful as the 'choice' we're offered between train operating companies - bad service or worse, high fare or higher, and a choice of dozens of different companies to complain to when our mail is lost

 * There are plenty of alternatives for packages and for high speed delivery (couriers etc) but there are no alternatives for simple physical letter delivery especially in rural areas.

So a free market can never truly exist here (same with railways and other processes where there are very large fixed costs - nature dictates only one supplier), which means we either accept this will never be a functioning service or we regulate it heavily.

 * Ultimately access to regular post is a requirement for a whole bunch of other rights like access to the court and healthcare system, access to markets for goods and services and for information (so freedom of speech/press).  We can minimise a lot of this (I don't understand why the NHS insist on posting me letters when email would be better for all of us) but we cannot yet eliminate it.

Also the working population can drive in from many locations so it would never get the high density of passengar numbers to justify the cost.

Have you been to Newcastle since 1980? There is a Metro system in place already, it covers Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, South Tyneside, North Tyneside and Sunderland. 

I think you will find that it is the SECOND largest metro system in the UK behind the Underground and ahead of Glasgows subway

true,DirtySeverus,null,null,"My problem with what you say loudribs, is that there is no concrete alternative and the status quo will do their best to make sure there never is. 
What we need to do as a race is start to experiment.
We could allow certain towns or even counties to try alternate models of society.

The situation we are in now is like endlessly being in the missionary position during sex because you are too afraid to try anything else.
Just because you decide to do doggy style for a while does not mean that if that is rubbish the whole act of sex has failed, you just try something else, then something else and so on.

Society should be changed by trial and error. Right now it just error and error with lies and warping the truth.
We all allow our fear of the unknown to stop ourselves moving forward.

Life should be an adventure, children enter the world with infinite expectations and they are basically abused by an uncaring, uncompromising system until they conform.
Renewable energy is suppressed by the status quo. Geothermal energy alone could give us more power that we need and there is still many other types of renewable energy.
We are at a turning point in history, we need to shed our skin and expand into a new age of human prosperity.
In a thousand years time people will look at our era in the same way that we look at the dark ages.

I would not feel so bad about humanity if this was all just an accident and we were trying our best, but we are not.
The way things are now have been engineered to be exactly this way.
Also, I hate it when rich people say that poor people should get better jobs, just so they can do whatever they want.
The fact of the matter is, that if everyone on earth became a banker we would all die out because nothing would ever get done.
Poor people allow rich people to exist, someone has to be on the bottom of the pyramid (in this society) and they should be respected.
Just like how Native Americans respect the land they walk on, the rich should respect the poor. 

We reward the lazy and no I am not talking about benefits. 
The real hard workers are the people who make businesses out of nothing but they get a really rough ride while bankers do next to nothing and stock brokers abuse the system.
As an example of how pointless stock broking can be, there are machines that can exchange shares in a fraction of a second that make millions on the stock market.
How does that help anyone other than those making the money?

Also renting properties, people just use excess money to buy up more than they need and abuse those who can’t afford their own property.
Not that I have anything against landlords, I would probably buy properties if I could.

Basically our motivation should be to make the world a better place, not to exploit people and destroy our ecosystem for made up numbers on a fucking hard drive.
I fully understand the term “if it’s not broken don’t fix it” but our society is broken.
I think if we make an effort to better ourselves as a race it would still take two or three generations to really get things right but the alternative is to carry on like this for another two thousand years or so.

Maybe we will get lucky and a meteor will wipe out most of us and we can try again, maybe we will get it right the next time.
I understand your point loudribs but you have to agree with me that society is in a pretty sorry state when a meteor wiping out most of the population would be an improvement (in the long run).

That's also why you tend to find that a lot of legislation occurs in response to some crisis or tragedy, which is sufficiently engaging to focus public attention on one issue, so that political capital can be made out of it.

Secondly, and this will be a little controversial, is that the things which are being suggested aren't that outrageous: 

* Road privatization - as I understand it, public ownership is maintained with existing roads, and tolls can only be charged if companies build a new road, or add new lanes to an existing road. The general lack of toll roads in Britain is actually an anomaly compared to the rest of Europe, and the toll schemes which have happened appear to have been successful.

* Integrating private providers into the health service is not extraordinary either, on a European level. In France many people actually have to pay a percentage of their care costs.

The police privatization is what shocks me, but it will depend whether it works its way through to the front line. No one cares about the fact that forensic testing is already privatized.

As for your other points, ignoring the information commissioner, and dodgy finance, we should certainly pursue the government for them, but unfortunately they are par for the course when you look at previous governments.

That actually made me laugh out loud and slap my knee (ashamed). I think I've been searching for that phrase for a long time!

I did manage to formulate it recently by asking *why* someone would want the freedom to say x, y or z. I can't remember the exact instance, but I posited that the only reason you want want to the freedom to say something in particular would be because you wanted to be insulting or demeaning to that particular group. Similar to the BNP/nigger example here: There's only one reason someone in the position of the BNP would wish to be free to use that term. And I think we can safely exclude popular culture/rap in that instance.

Back to the point: So while there are likely to be very few people who make bomb threats, the issue is of the common or garden numpties who take it seriously who are the problem?

     You can say what you want

You say:

    You can say what you want so long as it doesn't harm others

Now, if we're defining harm as taking emotional damage, then we have to accept the fact that people take emotional damage over all sorts of things. Cartoons of their prophet, poorly worded jokes, or even just hearing someone walk past them in the street talking about death when they've lost a relative. You can not universalise personal boundaries, because each human has different ones. Furthermore, some humans have really really stupid ones.

Now either we accept what I'm saying, that you're free to say whatever you want, or we accept what you say, and that has the logical conclusion that you are not free to say anything - you say it at the pleasure of the government or judiciary. If they choose to class what you say as bad, then you are in trouble.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I have a horrible feeling that you might actually be me who found a time machine 15 years ago and has blasted himself forwards in time to debate with his future self.

First things first, I have endless sympathy for your point of view. I realise that my first response doesn't exactly smack of a person with a bottomless well of sympathy for his fellow man but in actual fact, I'm innately upbeat about humanity. Nor am I blind to the problems you have raised with our current system. They are valid and pertinent. However, age does funny things to a man.

Here's where the problem lies: Democracy. In an ideal world, what you have suggested would be not only be possible but also a worthy venture that may well result in a better world. However, it's a view that would only be condoned by a small (and most likely young) minority and would thus never be palatable to the country at large. Why? Because despite the screaming inequality, despite the grotesque injustice and despite the patent wrongheadedness of it all, this system 'works' for a great many people. Sure, it may only work because they've never been able to envisage a world which differs from the one they inhabit and that some may be willfully ignorant of the system itself, but nevertheless it does seem like the Least Worst option for a great many people (remember, the fear of loss is a much greater motivator than the promise of gain and all big changes raise the spectre of loss). That means that in order to do what you suggest you would need at best a revolution and at worst, one followed by a dictatorship (it may only require a limited spell of dictatorship but a dictatorship never-the-less).

This is where ideas and political theory come in: Large scale revolutions only really succeed when there is an alternative on offer - after all, Do Not Want isn't the most enticing invitation to a dazzling future - and an alternative that actually makes sense to people. History has shown the likes of Communism and Fascism to be pretty stupid ideas when put into practice but on paper they looked good enough for people to actually get behind them and envisage a future that's radically different from the past (they also worked because they faced political systems and societies that had pretty much collapsed). And that's where the problem lies today: No-one has made a case that a critical mass of people can actually get their weight behind and until they do, people will always go with the devil they know.

A case in point: Take a look at the Occupy movement. Now, I personally have a lot of respect to the those who took part, I feel their criticism of the system was appropriate and it gave me warm, fuzzy feeling that people still care. However, at present it has produced nothing beyond the symbolic and is largely on the backfoot because it couldn't articulate what it wanted (and was also it's own worst enemy... the policy of not having figureheads was commendably noble but also crippling in terms of creating a narrative). It was great at saying what it didn't want but the question of 'what comes next?' was nothing more than a nebulous mess of well intentioned platitudes.

So there's nothing to be done, right? Wrong. Despite all the criticism I've just ladled upon them, I think Occupy are a pretty important historical milestone and wish them all the luck in the world. What they are is a stepping stone to greater awareness and a fillip towards a more cohesive narrative. However, this is a long game. Things have to get really bad for people to take notice and while we may think that 'this is the worst things have ever been' it's not. People are still eating. They have heat. Anarchy is not upon us. What you can do in the meantime is create a vision of a better world that can fill the vacuum *if* the old world collapses.",0,1332870132,null,0,false,0,c45j2dn,t3_rfq0n,t1_c45j2dn,t1_c45hy5i,null,1428604037,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Beginning with the Eleventh just seems backwards to me, and I really cannot stand Amy. Vincent and the Doctor really just didn't do it for me. Perhaps it was the casual way they reacted to Vincent still committing suicide just because it kept things status quo. Or maybe it's because Van Gogh actually didn't commit suicide and the Doctor should have known that. Or maybe it's the way they pronounce his name.

Any way, starting off with Eleven before Ten seems wrong. Sure one has the big-budget special effects, top-notch cinematography, and superb score, but story-wise you need to see Nine and Ten to understand a lot about Eleven, in specific the whole thing with River Song.

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"Here's the ""viewing plan"" that's worked for me to get people into the show:

**QUICK VERSION**

1. *The Empty Child*/*The Doctor Dances*
2. *The Girl in the Fireplace*
3. *Blink*
4. *Silence in the Library*/*Forest of the Dead*
5. *Midnight*
6. *The Eleventh Hour* onward

Yes, that's essentially just the pre-S5 Moffat episodes plus *Midnight* and then S5, but I think it works, and I think it's very important to watch *Silence*/*Forest* before you watch Series 5/6.

But, here's my ""long"" version - to catch people up on most of the ""major"" events quickly, without making them wade through *too* much that might turn them off (this is really if they DON'T plan to watch all of Series 1-4 after catching up with Smith's run):

**LONG VERSION**

1. *The End of the World*
2. *The Unquiet Dead*
3. *Dalek*
4. *Father's Day*
5. *The Empty Child*/*The Doctor Dances*
6. *Bad Wolf*/*The Parting of the Ways*
7. *The Christmas Invasion* (possibly with the 2005 Children in Need special right before)
8. *New Earth*
9. *Tooth and Claw*
10. *School Reunion*
11. *Rise of the Cybermen*/*The Age of Steel*
12. *The Impossible Planet*/*The Satan Pit*
13. *Army of Ghosts*/*Doomsday*
14. *The Runaway Bride*
15. *Gridlock*
16. *Human Nature*/*The Family of Blood*
17. *Blink*
18. *Utopia*/*The Sound of Drums*/*The Last of the Time Lords*
19. *Partners in Crime*
20. *Planet of the Ood*
21. *The Sontaran Stratagem*/*The Poison Sky*
22. *Silence in the Library*/*Forest of the Dead*
23. *Turn Left*/*The Stolen Earth*/*Journey's End*
24. *The Waters of Mars*
25. *The End of Time*, Parts 1 &amp; 2
26. *The Eleventh Hour* onward, no skipping

Again, the second list is basically for people who you don't think will watch all of Nine and Ten's runs, even after they finish Eleven's.  Or people who want the ""whole story"" without having to watch every episode.  This way you get most of the Time War backstory, all the finales and regenerations (though only one of the companion-introduction episodes), and you cut out most of the *really* ridiculous ones.

List amended based on jimmysilverrims' suggestions.

I'd also like to say that I *don't* think either of these lists is a true substitute for just watching it all in a row, but there are people that won't like some of the more dodgy aspects of RTD's run, and want to get through it quickly.

Comparing Doctor Who to MLP is unfair unless you use a very very basic rubric and the rubric needed to compare MLP to DW would be so basic as to tell us almost nothing. The problem is that they are so different from eachother (story-arch vs episodic, story-based vs character-based, drama vs comedy, etc.)

Comparing MLP to old 90s cartoons would be a better comparison and I think this show easily beats PPG and Dexters Lab in some aspects, while it lacks in others. There are few cartoons that can match the visual comedy in MLP, there are tons of things in MLP that are funny using pure visuals without even needing a joke to accompany it. The written humor isn't bad, I'd say it is mostly on par with the jokes you could expect out of kids shows now and from the 90s. What it lacks are interesting stories which most fans of the show will admit to, PPG and Dexters Lab easily beat it on creative storytelling (well Dexter moreso, PPG had plenty of bland stories.)

The problem with comedy is that it is one of the most subjective things to use as a comparison and since MLP is almost entirely a character-based comedy, if you don't find it funny then there is hardly anything left to like. Also, with character comedies, you pretty much have to like the characters to like the comedy. It's like watching a comedian you don't like and you don't think is funny, you won't laugh and you won't enjoy it at all.

...

Back? Good. I'm going to go over a few things it di very, very right that you simply do not see in My Little Pony.

1. **Character Humor**
 - You love Mac for being this sweet kid who has to put up with Bloo, and you love Bloo because he's so blatantly selfish and arrogant. That's a key thing MLP is missing. Other shows like Johnny Bravo and Dexter's Lab are okay with you not liking some aspects of the main characters, making them the [unsympathetic comedy protagonist](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist). They're okay with you thinking the character is a jerk because *that's the point*. They allow it to become part of the joke and it works with the story. My Little Pony wants you to like all of it's characters, think that every one of them is quite selfless and kind. By not embracing the idea of characters who are at hearts a bit of a jerkass they have to look at malice's much more bland and irksome twin: stupidity. Most plots are driven by some of the characters doing something blatantly stupid to cause problems for them to solve like going bonkerrs for virtually no reason (*twice*, they use that same plot *twice*) and other times you have characters like Rarity (the supposed embodiment of generosity) acting blatantly greedy at inopportune moments like when she nearly dooms Ponyville to a century of darkness because she wants to grab some gold.

2. **Physical Humor**
 - Note the background gag as ""Orlando Bloo"" and Princey enter the resteraunt. It's a background event that tells a story without words, but manages to be absolutely hilarious. That's the sort of physical humor that works. A simple prat fall or the cliched popping out from offscreen that Pinkie does incessantly isn't physical humor, because it doesn't really tell a story. You can't just have someone slip on a banana peel and call it humor, you have to create a set-up around it, how the peel got there, why the person doesn't notice it, how he falls down a flight of stairs afterwards, to make the joke funny.

3. **Adult Humor and References**
 - Many people will argue that MLP uses adult humor or makes references. It doesn't. It will only make a reference that you could make without having seen the source material. That is to say that they simply do not make a joke or reference if it hasn't already been done at least a dozen times before. The Big Lebowski characters in the background of a bowling alley? Already done in Foster's, PowerPuff Girls, and many other cartoons that do a bowling episode. From the I Love Lucy conveyor belt to the Benny Hill Yakety Sax stuff they will only make a reference if it is 100% safe to make. Meanwhile Foster's will make jokes like Bloo thinking Frankie's hot, or the lameness of Princey's one-liners being seen as ""good ones"" from the group or the successful recurring gag of ""not a kid"", not even to mention the brilliant ""Orlando Bloo"" joke.

Bottom line is that these nineties shows (hell, even these current shows like Adventure Time) are not only able to tell a more advanced plot, but they're able to tell it in a funnier way that's more creative and original than MLP, and that's what I actually respect and admire in a show.",0,1332872933,null,0,false,0,c45jo9j,t3_rfwas,t1_c45jo9j,t1_c45jeae,null,1428604310,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Sure, but doesn't that speak more of the problems inherent to the concept of human rights?

I don't see why. Where do you find a problem?

&gt;They're not holy writ, they exist to make lives better

Says a utilitarian. A kantian ethicist would argue that they exist to ensure freedom and to respect individuals right to live their lives how they choose.

&gt;But if upholding the human right to free speech makes people's lives worse (by effectively protecting people's right to give non-physical abuse) then I say fuck human rights.

Ok, little thought experiment that's often given to newer utilitarians.

Say there's been a bunch of murders in a village. The police fail to catch the murderer. One night the mayor hears there's going to be a riot unless people are satisfied the murderer has been caught. Lots of people will die in this riot. The mayor also finds out though, that the murderer has escaped town and can not be caught. So what the mayor does is picks someone at random, strings them up, and satisfies the crowd. The riot is averted, and instead of tens of people dying in a riot, one guy is killed. This is the sort of moral system you're advocating for right now ;)

&gt;you think people's lives are better by enshrined freedom of speech.

No, my ultimate value is not my subjective opinion of people's lives being better, this is part of why I find utilitarianism so disgusting - because someone else decides what's good for me. I believe in a system that lets people choose - not one that maximises happiness. The unique thing that humans can do is exercise choice, choose our destiny, be free to live how we want to live. I take a moral system which values these traits as the highest and most important of all - not whether a human happens to be living comfortably and safely and securely in their nice warm house.",0,1332873303,null,0,false,0,c45jr7w,t3_rfo6o,t1_c45jr7w,t1_c45jitx,null,1428604349,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not sure how you'd differentiate them.

Here's how. Dianne Abbot aimed it at no one in particular, she made no specific racial slur and the offence was wholly by implication. The implication being white people deliberately try to make minorities fight amongst themselves. Now if she had said ""rich people"" or ""elites"" or ""men in power"" or ""the government"" no one would have complained, and in fact after the two unjust wars on trumped up evidence, politicians expense scandal and banking collapse she may well have gained broad support for an anti establishment rant...but alas she chose to use lazy racial stereotyping to cast her boggy men and drew ire. No one was *personally* offended, people were outraged someone in a position of power could say something so frankly stupid.

Comparing that to calling people niggers, wogs and cotton picking slaves is a stretch.

No, I'm rejecting ""the line"" that you and people who think like you have convinced the world exists. You seem to care about the content, but I don't. Honestly we could be arguing about politics or nasty jokes, I don't care about the content.

I don't care whether Abbot said white honkeys were all demons from hell or whether she said something totaly innocent, I don't care whether this student guy called some footballer a wog or simply laughed at his weak heart - the content is irrelevent. The principle is what matters. A man is in jail right now for expressing something that some people in society didn't like. Think about that. He said something that some people don't want others saying, so he's gone to jail.

That's my problem. That line exists only where the people who maintain power decide it exists. Plenty of countries across the world have systems similar to that, China's a good example, middle eastern countries often also have similar systems. Maintaining harmony, avoiding moral corruption, making sure that no-one says something that a group of people don't want people saying.

The deficit is being reduced, interest rates are at an all time low, the economy is growing (albeit slowly), private sector employment is rising, the games industry is being encouraged by tax breaks, GlaxoSmithKline recently chose to invest in U.K jobs as a result of the budget, huge infrastructure is being fast tracked, red tape for building is being reduced, business zones created, start-up investment is being encouraged through tax breaks, apprenticeships being created, tax breaks for the lowest paid workers, gay marriage legislation, diversity within the primary education system with more academies, computer science soon to be taught in school, corporation tax being reduced to make us the most competitive G20 country for global companies to base themselves, super fast broadband, promotion of Techcity and so on.

If you think business is evil and all jobs should be through government then fair enough the current government is terrible, but  90% of the people I know were starting their careers when the financial crash happened and have been pretty screwed ever since. The number one priority for me and many others is private sector growth and the economy for a sustainable future, business is where the bulk of this needs to come from, our economy needs rebalancing and we are having to adapt from a nation which formerly relied on retail, house prices rising and banking for growth. My generation as far as I can tell tends to realise that switching away from that is not as simple as just whacking together another stimulus so that people pay a little less VAT for twelve months and some public service workers get to keep their jobs for another year through further borrowing.

I'm not even a Tory, but I do hope they sort of the shit storm Labour left my generation with, I like Labour and think they did some great things when they we're in power, but they have offered absolutely nothing in the last few years and the Tories seem to be the only party willing to make unpopular choices to sort things out. The flip side to that is we have to put up with all their lack of humanity and when it comes to welfare,  but Labour let welfare get ridiculous, why should people earning 200k a year be entitled to child benefit or pensioners taking 100k a year get free bus passes and T.V licences when people on minimum wage pay full price.

true,mwingoyo,null,null,"perhaps the biggest decision that needs to be made this summer is the future of carroll. sure, some additional midfield cover would be welcome. jury is definitely still out on adam and henderson. it's tough to handle because these guys came in on big fees, and haven't been able to replicate any of the same form that got them noticed in the first place. 

because henderson is so young, i think liverpool can afford to be patient, and see how he comes along over the next couple of seasons. also, he's been played out of position the entire season, for no reason in my opinion. keep kuyt, continue to use him on the right flank, and give henderson less game time. adam, however, has got to get his ass in gear! he did better when lucas was fit, but unless he starts pulling his weight, i'd be inclined to let him go sooner rather than later.

carroll has undoubtedly been one of the biggest investments/gambles in recent years. he hasn't contributed to the extent everybody expected, but then again, he displays the occasional bit of quality. he is also really young, and it'd be premature to let him go so early. unlike henderson though, you can't just play him less, until he starts finding his newcastle form. liverpool aren't going to get the best out of him until they pick up some higher quality wingers.

this is what i mean when i say that liva's stance on carroll is going to affect their market movement. if they are willing to allow their investment time to mature, and flourish, they should maybe consider investing in a right footed winger. johnson and enrique are the right kind of backs to supply quality crosses. downing is also of the right mold, but he hasn't been consistent. i think they should stick by him though; he'll come good.

if they are not willing to alter the team to get the most out of carroll, then they should go for a couple of new strikers perhaps (they need at least one addition, regardless).

possible players to go for if they want to consistently START carroll next season (PURELY my opinion): A Johnson, Hazard, Robben, etc. They all have attacking flair, but can cross the ball as well.

players to go for if they aren't interested in building around Carroll (again, my opinion, and it's a mix of quality, age, and position): Shane Long, Dempsey, Gomez, Rodallega, Ba, Tiote, etc. 

if it were up to me, here'd be my starting 11:

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Well here's an ""Explain it to Me Like I'm Five"" explanation: 


This Doctor is an alien called a Time Lord, a race of time travelers, and he has many adventures across space and time in a big blue box that's bigger on the inside with his friends.

When this Doctor gets hurt really bad he does something called ""regeneration"", which means he turns into a different looking person, but he keeps his memories.

But the Doctor stole his time machine from a museum, and the other Time Lords don't like his goofing off and think he's a criminal.

The Time Lords are stuffy and mean. Once they caught the Doctor they imprisoned him on Earth and broke his time machine.

For a long time the Doctor was stuck on Earth, where he helped the government fight aliens and a mean Time Lord with a beard called the Master.

But then the Time Lords needed the Doctor to help go back in time and prevent a race of mean nasty space aliens called the Daleks from being made.

The Daleks are very mean and look like pepperpots and kill people because they're awful.

The Time Lords fought with the Daleks so much that it turned into a great big war that nearly broke the whole universe.

But the Doctor stopped the Time War and killed all the Daleks, but he also killed all the Time Lords.

The Doctor was all alone and the last of his kind, like Superman.

So to take his mind off of things he decides to keep having adventures. He learns that some Daleks survived and that there's lots of bad things to stop from breaking stuff and killing people.

You should watch it because it's the perfect blend of funny, smart, scary, touching, sad, and uplifting. There's no other show with the kind of freedom Doctor Who has.

With Doctor Who you could go to the farthest reaches of space and fight aliens one episode and in the next have a chat with Vincent Van Gogh. The Doctor can be played by virtually any brilliant actor, and he always changes companions he brings with him.

The set, the time, the cast, all of these things can be changed at a moments notice and that's the freeing beauty of it.

This Doctor is an alien called a Time Lord, a race of time travelers, and he has many adventures across space and time in a big blue box that's bigger on the inside with his friends.

When this Doctor gets hurt really bad he does something called ""regeneration"", which means he turns into a different looking person, but he keeps his memories.

However the Doctor knicked his time machine from a museum, and all the other Time Lords are very cross with him and all his mucking about in time and space.

The Time Lords are stuffy and mean. Once they caught the Doctor they imprisoned him on Earth and broke his time machine.

For a long time the Doctor was stuck on Earth, where he helped the government fight aliens and a mean Time Lord with a beard called the Master.

But then the Time Lords needed the Doctor to help go back in time and prevent a race of mean nasty space aliens called the Daleks from being made.

The Daleks are very mean and look like pepperpots and kill people because they're awful.

The Time Lords fought with the Daleks so much that it turned into a great big war that nearly broke the whole universe.

But the Doctor stopped the Time War and killed all the Daleks, but he also killed all the Time Lords.

The Doctor was all alone and the last of his kind, like Superman.
So to take his mind off of things he decides to keep having adventures. He learns that some Daleks survived and that there's lots of bad things to stop from breaking stuff and killing people.

In terms of football, Benfica were good at passing but lacked an incisive finish. That being said, Luiz, Paulo and our very own Darth Maul-er kept them out for most of the game. 

Kalou was bad, his goal was down to him being in the right place at the right time. It exposed a major flaw in our line-up. We need Torres one way or the other. When he isn't scoring, he is working his socks off to create. In fact, I think had Drogs been playing up front, THAT goal wouldn't have happened. (We may or may not have scored differently, although...) 

We were quite bad at possession and quite lucky that we came away with a goal. Our play was mostly defensive rather than creative, IMHO. And even in defense we had our lapses.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. 

He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1332882932,null,0,false,0,c45lykm,t3_rgejy,t1_c45lykm,t3_rgejy,null,1428605594,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I go there to discuss **Chelsea** matches and even during our matches I have to just defend Chelsea of all the bashing we get instead of getting a chance to talk about the game itself. It is an absolutely ridiculous place to discuss football. Just look at my comment history from today, had to do it again too.

And the mods ([who just commented on this topic that they are waiting for some sort of report or suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/rd0dk/rfootball_is_now_soccer/c45eltm)) are the most lazy mods I have come across on Reddit. Not only are they running on the bare skeleton design provided by Reddit but they also don't really care what happens on it.

ScreamingGerman will remember my post where I mentioned on his /r/soccer post that my posts were not making it past the spam filter. This was after a couple of my posts stayed at the top of /r/soccer for a couple of days because of how many upvotes they got. I have never spammed anything on Reddit either and most of my posts are on small subreddits and are greatly appreciated. ScreamingGerman told me to contact them and I did.

So the mod replied telling me that if it happens again I should tell him and he had deleted my post because now it was already on the front page posted by someone else. It happened again and I messaged them. No one replied, 12 hours later they approved the post but then it was  in the middle of nowhere and no one got to see it.

Happened twice after that too. Messaged the mods, this time again I got no reply and the mods did not even bother going through my posts which were youtube videos and 101greatgoal videos. One of these links was then posted a Mod himself and it got on the front page of /r/soccer. I find this outragous.

So make /r/football happen or lets just have game discussion on our own subreddit. That is the worst subreddit I have come across on Reddit and it is one of the subreddits that I need the most.

But I wouldn't react because that is obviously what said person is after, and obviously have troubles deep within their soul to have to pick on something so obvious as race/disability etc.

Jenny grated on my nerves immensely in her episode, and I can't really express how displeased I was when they deus ex machina resurrected her at the end at Moffat's request, because that means he intends to bring her back at some point because that's how Moffat works. Everything about Jenny made me angry- all the other soldiers, even the ones straight from the machines, had dirty faces and messy hair and loose, baggy war-clothes. Then we get Jenny, who pops out without a trace of dirt on her, perfect makeup, perfect sleek blonde ponytail, and then the skintight t-shirt and pants and sexy-boots that not a single other soldier in the show was seen wearing. She has not a single flaw, in appearance or personality, and whether it's TV or books or movies, characters like that consistently have my undying hatred. Look how adorable and bubbly and giggly she is! Look how good she is with a gun, and how she can flirt with guards to get them out of prison, and how she can completely absurdly vault her way through a maze of incinerating lasers! She's one of the worst Mary Sues I've ever seen, and that's saying something. 

Then, the Doctor talks about how he had a family that he had to personally destroy in the Time War and how looking at her hurts because it reminds him of them, and Donna goes and says that this random fully-grown chick who happens to have two hearts but no regeneration abilities (that was the Source that revived her at the end, not some inherent Time Lord physiology) that he doesn't know at all, who was made from his DNA that was taken by force, is going to help him get over that. Are you kidding me? She's not his daughter, he didn't watch her grow or have any emotional connection to her- she is a complete stranger, closer to a female clone than a daughter since there weren't two contributors of DNA to create a new unique individual, and a disgustingly perfect one at that. 

And of course she gets brought back to life, and flies off in a spaceship because she's got ""planets to save, civilizations to rescue, monsters to defeat""- are you kidding me? She's some sort of renegade vigilante now? The Doctor does what he does because he can see time's fixed and flux points, because he's lived hundreds of years and knows people and has experience and background knowledge that'll help him know what to do- she knows nothing, none of that- all she has is the knowledge of the week-long war and military tactics, that's all the machine gave her in terms of knowledge, and she shouldn't be interfering in any other planets' business! 

So I'm not looking forward to her return, though I'm sure it's inevitable at some point, and I sincerely hope this new companion isn't a new regeneration of her, because that'll just piss me off beyond measure.  Besides, Moffat's already made one pseudo-Time Lord with River (Which still brings an ""are you kidding me"" reaction from me, seeing as if functional part-Time Lords could be made by two plain human beings having babies in TARDISes then somehow I suspect the last remaining one of the species would have been working on that by now), we don't need to do it all over again.

Now he's the sole remainder of the ancient Time Lord authority, an ancient and shell-shocked veteran who killed his family along with everyone else.

Although I think her ""regeneration"" is up for debate (it's vague enough so that they could say it's regeneration and recast) I can't argue with her Mary Sue-edness, I suppose the only thing I can say in her defense is that was sort of what they were going for.

She was meant to be this genetically created thing, designed to be a perfect soldier and do everything perfect. And then the Doctor comes and and says ""I honestly do not give two shits about you"" and he says that it's not who you are that's important, but what you become and what you choose to do.

He doesn't mourn her because she's his ""daughter"" (which I totally agree with you on, I think acting like she deserves that title is presumptuous), but because she had become something different than how she was born. She was designed to kill for war, but chose to die for peace. In effect the Doctor realized at the last moment that he could have had a daughter, could have continued the Time Lords, could have turned nothing into something. But he realizes all this after it's gone.

Or at least that's what I got from analyzing the episode.

I also like the *idea* of the Doctor reuniting with his daughter a bit more than the actual character herself. He hasn't been in that position for a *loooong* time, and we constantly get these tantalizing moments when someone asks the Doctor if he had kids and he wistfully looks into the distance.

Seeing the Doctor in a father role, playing against someone who would *refuse* to let him take the ""I've brought you into danger, you're only here because of me"" card. Someone who actively *wants* adventure and excitement.

Regenerative abilities really probably are debatable, but I hate that idea.  If that sort of technology existed where you could create unique beings out of just one DNA source and the Time Lords had been wiped out, why on earth has the Doctor not gone and started repopulating functional Time Lords by now?  It's the same logic as River magically being a ""Time Lord"" because two humans had sex in a TARDIS, and I don't like it. Unlike all the other soldiers who seemed utterly devoted to the cause and rarely paid attention to it, Jenny never seemed to show much interest in being a soldier or the war.  They even tried to disavow her because she was from ""pacifist stock"" or whatever.  So I don't think she ever changed much, but I agree to an extent that she decided to die ""for peace""- more to save the Doctor, but whatever.  And I agree that the episode's point was that he ""could have had a daughter"", but I think that's BS and don't agree with it for the reasons stated- she was a clone, not a daughter.  And I'm not sure how he would have continued the Time Lords with her without being excessively creepy.  And possibly mutated, if Time Lord DNA incest works like humans (since she's basically entirely his DNA, which makes no sense for reproductive purposes).  

I do like the idea of the Doctor having a daughter/family, but I don't want it to be her and I don't want it like that.  I agree that it could be very interesting plot-wise and a difference facet of the Doctor that we've never really seen, at least in New Who.  I don't agree with the ""I've brought you into danger/actively wants adventure and excitement"" argument because I think we've had plenty of that in companions already and thus certainly aren't left wanting for characters with those traits- Rose said eff you I'm coming back to save Nine's ass, Donna spent ages chasing the Doctor down for a more adventurous lifestyle (not to mention Jack), etc.  I like non-humans too, but I don't want bullshit mechanics to create more Time Lords, like they're apparently trying to do/imply with River and Jenny.  If the creation of a Time Lord is as stupidly easy as their creation scenarios make it look, then I want nothing to do with it.  The Master/Gallifrey extended-ridiculous-complicated plot is more like something I'd accept, and if they wanted to bring them back it should have been having some of them stay during that.

I know in other regions there are charities where the Council include them in their IT contracts and then the Council bills them. So maybe, for example, that's £20m less £Xm charged out. The Council certainly used to do this with their photocopiers, for which they used to get a hilariously good bargain on.

There's a difference between being stressed out at a deadline and going cartoonishly bonkers over the course of an afternoon or turning into a goddamn lunatic because you think your friends are having a party without you. You can have flaws, but MLP doesn't portray them realistically or even interestingly, embracing extremes and cliches instead of forming a subtle and unique character.

The characters will do terribly selfish things like rallying children to run away from and alienate a newcomer that you know is of no danger to them  *for fun*. That's just being a dick, and it's okay for a character to do that, but MLP simply doesn't point this stuff out or make fun of it, it just creates issues with their slapdash writing.

Their sound system kicks out the bass but isn't high quality and the crowd there tends to be unaware of their surroundings (to put it politely). The only other venue that used to play that sort of music every night was ocean rooms/the yard/whatever it's called now. It's been shut down regularly due to the violence they've had.

Your best bet would be to explore some of the venues out in Hove. Hove tends to aim for the crowd a step up from the students whilst maintaining the Brighton atmosphere. Hbar on church road have some great resident DJs and some incredibly high profile names for such a small venue.

I don't want her to return. I thought she was a poorly written character with a shoddy premise. Watching that episode (I've never bothered to or wanted to re-watch it) actually annoyed me, because I couldn't help feeling that it would have been a fairly solid episode without her, despite the fact that she was the damn title character.

I disliked the obnoxious perkiness of the character. I felt that the attempt to make her seem like an 'action girl' was cack-handed. A lot of her mannerisms just came across as cheesy pandering. The episode  attempted to wring sympathy for her by making the Doctor himself seem like an unreasonable jerk for having perfectly reasonable misgivings about her. Of-sodding-course he didn't accept her as his daughter - he'd just met the chirpy little twit! She even got to have both a tragic heroic death and a last-minute-reprieve, which for a character we'd only just been introduced just came across like having the whole slice of drama cake and scoffing it too. Everything about the character made her seem like somebody's self-indulgent fan fiction creation. I know people can be overly critical of female characters in particular, so I ought to point out that she's the only supposed-to-be-liked female character in new Who so far that I actually dislike.

The actor herself wasn't terrific, but I won't blame her. Maybe with a better role she would have been OK.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"I totally agree that a decision needs to be made if Carroll is the player we are going to be building around, but your examples of Johnson, Hazard or Robben are all very unlikely to want to join the club. Any of those players would be welcomed at any of the top 4 sides.

As far as your starting 11, I agree with your injury concerns over Agger, but I'm not convinced that Coates is ready to be a full time starter. When he *is* fit, Agger's quality can't be denied, though, and I think Coates will get ample opportunities to play. Skrtel, likewise, is about as dependable as they come and while he's had a bad run of form in the last two weeks, it's hard to find many other bad performances from him. Our defence, when fit, is amongst the best in the league. I don't see the need to change out one of the few consistent things the team has shown. Also, remember that Kelly is a highly rated centreback (his natural postion).

If you want LOADS to write about Special effects and how far technology has brought the intricacies of makeup, lighting, and costuming, *Flesh and Stone* (thats 5x06) is a **must.** The angels in that episode were done with makeup and costuming on a scale that's probably the best I've ever seen. That's not even to mention the brilliant sets that were designed in both of those episodes, and the preceding episode's moment of badass (""there's one thing you never, **ever** put in a trap."").

For other various reasons such as use of on-location shooting and scouting, I recommend *The Vampires of Venice, Vincent and the Doctor,* *The Impossible Astronaut,* and *Let's Kill Hitler.* Then again, I'm enormously biased; Let's Kill Hitler is my favourite episode of Smith's run so far.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;this study only considered death rates for one aspect of care, post-heart attack

The paper chooses AMI (acute myocardial infarction) on the basis that the nature of AMI after-care is significantly under the control of the hospital management and physicians.  AMI outcomes are greatly down to a choice decision of the hospital.  AMI as a quality indicator has been well determined by *Thomas, Holloway and Guire (1993) Validating Risk-Adjusted Mortality as an Indicator of Quality of Care*.  It's been used in numerous past and recent studies in the US to compare quality and competition for these reasons.

&gt;It also doesn't address the type of system that will result from the new Act.

What do you want people to do?  Time travel into the future to show you results of the new system conclusively indicating all aspects of healthcare leading to higher death rates?  Even those which do not relate to treatment and care?  Obviously no current or past system will exactly match up.  Heart related problems are a leading cause of death in Britain and the outcome is heavily related to the care received.  All this evidence is highly significant and relevant and can't just be ignored because ""oh, it's not perfect"".  Do you think The Lancet, one of the leading medical journals in the world, is staffed by such incompetent fools that they would cite an irrelevant study?

The conclusion the report came to was obvious, more competition led to lower quality of care.  The higher death rates aren't some mysterious outcome.  *Thomas and Hofer (1998) Research Evidence on the Validity of Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rate as a measure of Hospital Quality of Care* is a comprehensive study which shows this.

&gt;However, it is at least tangentially related. 

Tangentially related?  Do you know what the term means?

&gt;So you can have an upvote.

A new winger to play on the right. Downing has started to show his worth recently so should be able to deal with the left side of our midfield but we don't really have a first choice right-side player. Bellamy is getting old (and has dodgy knees), Hendo just doesn't work on that side as it is and Maxi just never gets played.

Then maybe another Left back to cover Enrique since Aurelio seems to be pretty much finished now (a shame because I do love that guy).

true,holdontoyourtowel,null,null,"Here on r/doctorwho it always seems like Amy is constantly being glorified for being sooooo sexy and teh bestest companion evar, and it kind of irks me, because I see her as this perpetually useless damsel in distress. But unlike other female companions, not once does she do anything useful of her own volition when it comes to saving the world. Throughout season 5 she doesn't do anything in particular, and in Pandorica/Big Bang she switches with the Doctor, but she's ""dead"" and can't remember any of it (unlike badass amazing Rory who's way too good for her considering how shittily she treats him), and ooh, she remembers REALLY HARD to bring the Doctor back but only because River miraculously showed up to remind her which made no sense whatsoever because River wouldn't have remembered him or her either. I'm sorry, but big whoop. Same went for all of season 6, and she played even less a role in the finale. So as far as Amy goes, she's this irritatingly oversexualized chick who was a stripp-oh, I mean kissogram when we first met her and is constantly running around in retardedly short skirts and shorts, generally treats Rory like crap for her first season, and she has pretty much the least believable emotions ever in every damn episode- neither she nor Rory seem even the slightest bit bothered by that they're going to ""raise"" their daughter as a childhood friend, whereas any real parent would have the Doctor chasing her down so fast he wouldn't know what hit them.  They try to make her feisty/sassy, but it's never believable and just seems impotent and pathetic and annoyingly whiny.  She's not even funny, I can't think of a single time her lines have made me laugh.  Also, she supposedly changes her entire life when she gets her parents back, but it doesn't affect her at all apparently, she's the exact same person she was- what's up with that?  Etc etc etc. And I like Rory and think he's badass, but it's unfortunate because all his badassery is tied to his dedication to Amy, and he and his motivations are constantly overshadowed by her and River.

To go ahead and add it here, I strongly dislike River, too.  Here's why:

River is, in short, a similarly oversexualized, cougar Mary Sue. I think her story's concept is interesting, but I can't enjoy it because I don't like the way she's been characterized. I thought she was very interesting and at her best in Silence/Forest (not sure if this is because of her dynamic with Tennant in part either), and I know that this was the most mature version of her and we keep seeing her in more and more immature incarnations, and some people use that to defend her, but I don't see that as excusable. River's constant sexual innuendo drives me up the wall- I'm a screamer, two Doctors on her birthday, handcuffs, blah blah blah. I don't like it. Before, with both Nine and Ten, even when we saw Ten fall in love with Rose, there was always a very distinct sense of asexuality about the Doctor, with the exception of a few kisses. All of a sudden, with the introduction of River, we're told blatantly several times that he's sexually active with her, and that's just awkward, especially because, as many people have pointed out, the relationship between Eleven and River is completely unbelievable.  I don't see any sort of attraction or romance dynamic between them, even in the ""Nights with the Doctor"" shorts when we see them go on dates and stuff- it always just feels out of place because their entire plot is about ""telling us"" they're in love, not ""showing us"" and thus convincing us.  They can say ""they're the greatest love story of all time!"" as many times as they want, but that doesn't convince me it's true.  As for the Mary Sue, River's few faults don't count as far as I'm concerned because they're results of her training at the hands of the Silence, and she doesn't even really kill the Doctor. So she's in general just very grating, for all those reasons. In addition, I think her story has long since played out- she and Amy and (unfortunately since I do like him as a whole) Rory have all been around for far too long, their story has been told, I'm tired of them and want them to go- three seasons is far too long for companions to be around, and especially not when two of them are so unlikable in every sense but their looks. (Rose's two seasons didn't bother me as much because she was with two different doctors, so the dynamic was different.)

(To make sure that this doesn't come off as ""oh it's just another girl being jealous because [insert-name-here] has teh sxiness,"" I love the other female companions, and, while I can objectively acknowledge that many of them are gorgeous, I find them likable/useful/both. Rose looked into the heart of the TARDIS and destroyed the Dalek fleet, Martha walked across the earth for an entire year while her family was held hostage, and Donna was the most important woman in the universe and saved everyone as the DoctorDonna, having all her personal growth destroyed as a price. Those women are amazing and beautiful and I love them all. I also love Sarah Jane, Sally Sparrow, Madame de Pompadour, Liz Ten, Rita in the God Complex, Nasreen Chaudry, the Victorian-era Silurian woman and her girlfriend/maid, etc, and I would have loved to see more of any of them. So I have nothing against female companions in general. Also, I love Nine, Ten, and Eleven is fantastic by himself and when you eliminate the lame companions- I adore him with Craig/Stormageddon, for instance, so it's not a particular Doctor thing, either.)",0,1332897107,null,0,false,0,c45ot3a,t3_rg653,t1_c45ot3a,t1_c45nxv6,null,1428607049,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Meant to attest that your accusation was moronic, not you yourself. Everyone is capable and culpable of that on here and by no means do I preclude myself from that. 

If you go through my history then you'll definitely find a large number of Guardian links, but just as many are to blogs, indie sites (back of fag packet calculation) and journals. Certainly have linked to the live blogs and generally over the Health Bill in particular, but then what other paper had decent coverage prior to about two months ago? 

Also not immune from linking bits from FT (when avail), and certain Telegraph writers (Oborne, Knowles, Chivers etc) along with bits from the Indie (so Independent it carries editorial, but I digress).

Theyll need to replace anyone who leaves, not loaned players like cole/aquaman but kuyt/maxi and bringing in striker. CL football isnt happening so obviously Cavani and the other big names wont come. I personally dont know many good targets as I would want a young player but the mancs are getting rid of dzeko and berbatov, 2 players i like that might be cheap.


The only real problem is right midfield and if kenny would use maxi more I reckon it would be fine. Sterling is coming through the academy and suarez can play there in a 4-3-3. So not a huge problem but definitely one that needs addressing.

And actually, I believe that in the classic series the Doctor was offered the position of President of the Time Lords or whatever and turned it down.  So even if he rebuilt the race, I doubt he'd want to be their leader.  As for the Time Baby nonsense, clearly he didn't know.  Doesn't mean I approve of the situation.

In New Who there was some specific quote/line about how the Time Lords were a race developed/evolved over time by millennia of exposure to the Untempered Schism.  I don't know if this is supposed to include the regeneration stuff, or only the ability to see fixed/unfixed points in time and that timey-wimey jazz that the Doctor apparently gets (a la Fires of Pompeii), or what.

true,drakeg4,tardis,TARDIS,"Well I found time to watch it. I've always had a positive reaction to Fosters, though I never got too into it, so I didn't expect to run into any problems with it. It is definitely a good show, though comparing two shows doesn't make either one bad.

I'll take your points in the order you made them.

_1. Fosters is definitely more mature than MLP (no surprise given CN is pretty lenient when it comes to what you can put into a show) and this allows the writers more freedom for the characters to be more sardonic. By forcing the characters in MLP into these ""elements"" in the first episodes the creators shot themselves in the foot by making any deviation of character later on seen as a writing fault, which some may be but sometimes they just ""bend the rules"". Also, given the massive restrictions put on them by Hasbro, it limited their ability to make characters into jerks. Faust, herself, said even using the word ""egghead"" was treading a very delicate line because even mild rudeness was seen as troublesome. This was somewhat alleviated by having the EI rating removed in Season 2.

* With the removal of the EI tag S2 has managed to mostly stay away from making the characters seem oblivious (besides Lesson Zero). I would argue your statement about ""most episodes"" relying on character stupidity. I briefly looked over the episodes and there are not that many that rely on them being intentionally ignorant to the obvious solution. They exist, but I think you are exaggerating here. The two ""make character go crazy"" ones do sortof fall into that category and it is no surprise they are done by the same writer.

* Rarity has been a consistent character though definitely not the most true to her ""element."" She has pretty much always been manipulative, vain, and greedy but has a conscious that lends her to being helpful sometimes. She is the least ""nice"" of the characters but at least these traits have remained consistent. Your description of the Dragonshy episode is a bit sensational given that her part was just character gag rather than a real solution. Technically every character failed and therefore could have doomed everyone to a century of darkness but the point of that was to get FS to do her bit after seeing her friends fail.

_2. It is a straw-man to compare a general pratfall to a specific example of a joke from Fosters. MLP has plenty of physical comedy with setups, when I previously said they don't need a joke, I meant they don't need an obvious setup to it. A nice example was the look of shock on Pinkies face as she was being pulled out of the house after it was destroyed by Spike in ""Secret of My Excess."" Both the setup and punchline were told through the visuals and it was pretty funny. We got what needed to be said from the look on her face, which was priceless, this really isn't much different than the Fosters cast playing dressup, a gag which has been done plenty of times before but I won't fault a show just for using a gag. Gags like these are used in many comedies because they are reliable.

_3. MLP doesn't use adult humor and I didn't argue it did, that is an argument typically used by someone who can't understand why they like the show and are trying to justify it by overselling a relatively small part of the show. The references only serve to add that much more interest to adults, it doesn't drive the interest, it just accents it. The I Love Lucy scene could have easily been done another way but why not use that scene to reference something if it fits. You act as if references are bad, everyone uses them and anything that is worth referencing has been done before, that is how pop culture references work. There are a few references that are more subtle that aren't so overused in other shows, like throwing in ""The Persistence of Memory"" into the background of one scene, that was a nice touch.

* While not adult humor, it uses the humor it has to good effect, jokes don't have to be cynical to be funny. MLP often does jokes just as well as Fosters even though MLP jokes may be more lighthearted because of the nature of the show. I found the ""not a kid"" joke to be pretty good because of the snide way in which Bloo says it, which says more to the delivery than the joke, the repetition wasn't overplayed either. I disagree that the Orlando Bloo joke was ""brilliant"", it was a relatively easy play on his name and they had to go even further to explain the joke by having it repeated to ensure everyone got the joke, which cheapens it. Having a show go too far to explain a joke that is meant to be subtle or make the punchline obvious makes the joke less funny, MLP typically avoids this.

Finally, while I agree MLP could use some more originality in the plotlines, I don't think it is any less funny than the nineties shows or shows like Adventure Time. When it comes to comedy, what makes something funny isn't necessarily the joke, but the delivery, and MLP has comedic delivery that easily equals (and sometimes exceeds) many other cartoons. It may not have the wit of more well made comedies, (Community, have I said this enough yet? Also, Community) it does have the delivery necessary to make its jokes and humor funny. I admire originality but I don't require a perfect storm to like a show. For example, House is a great show but boy is it predictable most of the time. Adventure Time is great but it doesn't make me laugh a lot, it tells cool stories but it is only funny in a quirky humor kindof way. It has the kind of humor that you notice and enjoy but don't ever really laugh at. Futurama is tied with South Park as my favorite TV cartoon. Futurama and South Park have great physical humor and jokes that actually make me laugh, Futurama even managed to make me laugh at a damn banana peel fall, I was sortof ashamed at myself for that laugh but I respected Futurama for doing it though I think I was laughing more at the absurd fact that they attempted that joke than the actual joke, which, given the show was probably the point. Futurama even has pretty deep characterization, another thing I admire in shows, and one thing MLP off pulls at least as well, if not better than, its competitors. Overall I think MLP deserves recognition, though not as much as it has, for being a good show. It isn't the best cartoon but it is certainly on the above average end than the below average. I worry that you are being too hard on it, you don't have to like a show to acknowledge its strengths.

The regenerations are indeed endowed by the Time Lords, but this is giving additional lives or taking lives away. They don't seem to just give people thirteen at random, it seems that you are born with thirteen and if you want more you see the Time Lords.

Similarly we see Melody Pond regenerate into River Song without any intervention or bestowment of power from the Time Lords, so there's that too.

* Martha is Dorothy from Wizard of Oz, because a building she was in got swept up and she found herself in a strange world.  Eventually, when the Wondrous Character turned out to not be what she had hoped, she decided she would leave this strange new world behind and return home to her family.

* Donna is Alice from Alice in Wonderland, because she was a rude little girl who got into all sorts of trouble, causing great fun and conflict for the characters involved, but when she got home, it was probably just all a dream (even though we know it wasn't, she never will)

* Amy is Wendy from Peter Pan, because her imaginary friend showed her a wondrous imaginary land, then left her behind for a long time before returning again.  Also, the imaginary friend ended up taking her daughter with him (also notable, as mentioned above, was that Rory doesn't age).

He doesn't want to rebuild the race though. Given that we seem to agree that the whole concept of cloning Time Lords was terrible it seems to me this would be a good place to end this part of the discussion.

Personally I don't like the idea of the Time Lords being a species, and I hated that line from AGMGTW about the Untempered Schism (though I don't think it was as specific as you think). Gallifrey had non-Time Lords as well, and the ability to regenerate was definitely something they had control over rather than just being some sort of mutation. The Master was able to add extra regenerations by draining some of the energy from an artificial black hole called the Eye of Harmony. The Eye was created by Omega and Rassilon, the founders of Time Lord society. It was Rassilon who discovered a way to fortify Gallifreyan DNA by adding a third helix ([a concept that's not as mad as it sounds](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=triple-helix-designing-a-new-molecule)), allowing it to regenerate.

I think the best explanation for River being altered in a similar manner is that Kovarian and the Silence needed a gestating foetus that had been exposed to the energy of the time vortex in order to alter its DNA in utero.

The strange storm that gave the misfits their powers: We already know they're not the only ones with powers. It is entirely conceivable that a similar storm happened in the US (since it's never explained what it is, or how many it affected).

Pretty much none of the existing misfits stories fit very well with US society, mainly due to cultural differences, and the prolific amount of guns to be found. However, the base concept of young delinquents serving out community service for crimes committed, suddenly gaining super powers, still works.

What I'd like to see though, is that they make a set of entirely new characters, and entirely new stories. This way, if it works as a show, it'll be a good addition to the world/IP of Misfits, and if it doesn't... well then it doesn't sully the original show by being a bad knockoff.

You're right, that Edinburgh council doesn't have the power to stop the DEA or ACTA. However, if the Pirate party does well in Edinburgh, the other parties will take notice and will adjust their policies acordingly.

So if 5% of voters give the Pirate Party their 1st preference, while we won't get elected, the others will take notice. Note that this will not be a wasted vote, because the electoral system is STV, and these people's votes will all transfer to their next preference.

The Scottish parliament currently doesn't have powers to stop the DEA or ACTA either, but if it gets more powers -- for example if Scotland becomes independent or if a devo-max option happens -- it probably will do.

&gt; You've got women gettin their heads kicked in for being too goth

What would you like to see Edinburgh council doing about that?

&gt; all sorts of crap with transport.

We do have policies regarding the buses and the tram situation, and we'll putting them on our website shortly.

In short: we think the tram was a bad decision that's been poorly executed, but it's too late to cancel it now so we should make the best of it and do everything to make it successful. This means development along the tram route (housing, workplaces, shops, liesure facilities, etc) to give people more reasons to use it.

We think that a ticket should be valid for all public transport in Edinubrgh: so a day ticket would work for Lothian and First buses, for the tram, and for rail journeys entirely inside Edinburgh.

&gt; The stuff around waverly is a nightmare some mornings

Do you mean the roadworks? I agree.

&gt; I'm supposed to vote for pirates because they will set the internet free?

You can vote for who you want to. If lots of people do vote Pirate -- in Edinubrgh and elsewhere[*] -- then yes we will keep the internet free. Again, I'd point out that if you vote for us and we don't get elected, it isn't a wasted vote -- your vote is transferred to your next preference. Ain't STV wonderful?
