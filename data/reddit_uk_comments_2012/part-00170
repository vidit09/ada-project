&gt;It is worth noting that there is a greater emphasis throughout guidance is on ensuring that the activity identified is appropriate for the participants health condition or disability and being aware of their barriers to work, including ill health/disability and any reasonable adjustment requirements when organising an activity with an employer.

Apart from being badly written, this makes it very unclear who is responsible for footing the cost of the 'reasonable adjustments' which are presumably those required by the Disability Discrimination Act. Under normal circumstances, it would be the employer, but as the scheme in question is supposed to only 'mandate' (i.e. force) people into work deigned^1 to be of community benefit' such as charities, it seems rather ambiguous.

I'd suggest it should be the Work Programme Providers, as they seem to be the people making profit from this. If they screw up, they ought to be liable for compensation to the people unfairly ~~forced~~ mandated into work they are not actually capable of, or which would be detrimental to their health condition.

I've actually had the best success with a solar powered Halloween light I found in Canadian Tire. Bit too late to pick one of them up now, I'm afraid.

Also don't overlook cheap flashlights or penlights. It's best, I've found, to go with simple, plain ones, that you can then embellish, but if you find something striking enough, go with what you find. I once made a sonic out of the innards of a cheap plastic telescope.

Electrical tape does look sloppy, but if you want to get a ""crackled"" finish similar to 9 and 10's sonic, that's actually quite easy. 

* First pain the body whatever colour you want to show between the cracks, and let it dry. 
* Then paint over it with white school glue. You may want to water it down a little bit. 
* When the glue has just started to dry - around 15 minutes but it depends on the glue, the temperature, the humidity, etc - paint over it with another colour. As the glue dries it shrinks, producing a crackled effect. It's quick, and can produce amazing variety based on brushstrokes, amount/consistency of glue, and when you apply the second colour.

For a start our defence last year stayed in place and were tight at the back and Lucas was there ensuring that few attacking players made it through, this year we press much, much higher up the pitch without a DM so we've been susceptible to counter attacks and time and time again we've been exposed and its cost us, not to mention the amount of times Ive seen players day dreaming in the box when a corner has been taken.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"Great response! Interesting points and lots of things to think about throughout. I don't disagree with everything you said ;)

Cars ARE fun unless you live in a traffic infested hell hole. I'm not saying that they're ideal for everybody. I think that inner-city travel can be served well by a good subway system or monorail (as popular in large asian cities). I definitely wouldn't try to stop-start a car through the centre of London! Our rail system could definitely be better too for long journeys. But if I'm going to travel 10-50 miles to go outside of town, the only time (and probably cost) efficient way is to drive. Even in the future, I just can't see it would ever be possible to have public transport which is capable of matching that because of sheer number of destinations and distances involved. You're still going to need multiple bus changes and waiting around.

Independence: children aren't independent anyway, so I'm not too worried about them - and I still wouldn't let a child ride their bike by themselves! Getting a car license and running a car does cost too much money right now, but it doesn't HAVE to be that way. Tax is 70% of the cost of petrol. Tax costs hundreds of ££ a year. VAT adds to the cost of the car. The government could instantly reduce the costs of driving if they wanted, so it's not an inherent problem with cars as a method of transport. It's a problem created by taxes.

I suspect that cars cost more simply because they are a better means of transportation and they are in demand which is why the government can afford to tax them to raise money. I admit that they do cause problems you mentioned like pollution etc, but personal convenience will simply never be matched by public transport for a lot of journeys.

Dependence on oil.. it won't always be that way. Electric cars etc which will be powered from renewable energy power plants. Same with your remarks about inhalers etc - cars are cleaner and cleaner all the time, which is good.

Mud - haha, I don't just mean fields! But any road when wet is going to be dirty, gritty, wet leaves and cars passing which spray stuff. I did try cycling to work a few years ago and it was ok in good weather. But as soon as it was raining, it was a horrible experience. Since then I drive and put the AC on when it's hot and the heated seat when it is cold! :P

You're right about human components, but I feel that those things are still getting better and better. Cars are getting safer all the time, for occupants AND pedestrians - better braking distances, softer impacts etc and even computer assisted driving now. 

You're right about people being idiots and stupid, but I feel that this is probably a problem spurred on by the popularity of cars, rather than inherent to cars themselves. If cycling was as popular and widespread as cars are now, I'm sure there would be plenty of problems arising. That happens any time a huge number of people use anything.. there will be a minority of morons.

You're also right about urban planning. Things should definitely be designed for convenience without cars. But I also think that we can improve driving to remove a lot of the problems you named. A lot of the cost of ownership is caused by the government adding tax simply because they know people don't want to give up their cars. And problems like parking and traffic jams etc can be solved with better city planning. In asia they have underground car parks which are convenient, spacious, don't take up room and aren't an eye-sore. They're usually free too!

It seems to me that a lot of your points are based on people using cars for really short journeys through cities, which I agree is stupid. For the journeys I do, the car is absolutely perfect. I typically do a 20 minute drive down a motorway and a couple of A roads. That takes 1hr 25 by two buses. No train link at all. It's not really cycle-able, and my g/f can't even ride a bike! I also commonly use the car to pop 5 minutes to the out of town supermarket. I could technically get the bus, but it takes 3-4x longer to walk to the stop, wait, wait after shopping, drag all of my shit onto the bus, haul it back to my house etc. I'd also need outdoor clothes for the walk, but then sweat my arse off in the store and on the bus. Whereas the car is super quick and convenient. There's occasional traffic but it's a small inconvenience to jump into the car in my t-shirt, throw my shopping in the boot and go home! I don't even see a PERFECT public transport system being able to compete with that.

I suppose I am a bit selfish. The car is just so convenient and liberating. Taking public transport feels like punishment.. it's worse in pretty much every way. I accept that it could be improved a lot in terms of speed, routes covered and overall ""niceness"" (like temperature, condition of the bus etc), it will never be door to door.

Good points through, and I think what you say about human elements and the problems associated with costs, accidents, pollution etc are very fair. However, I'd suggest that those things are already improving, and further technological developments can improve them further, making cars safer for everybody and the environment.

true,baconstyle,null,null,"From the time when Rafa Benitez stepped out to say that there is no money, we've been in a bad position. It was the end of the 2008/2009 season i believe, where we had to fund our transfers by selling players. Needless to say we struggled to 7th that season and then the board decided to blame it on Rafa and sacked him. The board then had its issues with separation and debts and called in Roy Hodgeson to ""steady the ship"".
Christian Purslow, our managing director at that time, decided to sign joe cole on massive wages to proof to the fans that  we're still in ""the game"". We struggled with the long ball identity that season and were in bad form. Tom &amp; Hicks, the club's owners finally were forced to sell the club by RBS because of their debts.FSG stepped up and saved us. 
After some more dismal performances, FSG and roy hodgeson parted ways. King Kenny was hired as an interim manager and did brilliantly well to ignite the passion for football again. It was the same period of time torres, disillusioned with life at anfield, transferred to our rivals, Chelsea FC. We signed Carroll for 35 million and luis suarez after. 
The next season the board were adamant to get Champions league and they handed King kenny a large transfer kit. Whether Damian comolli(Director of football) or King Kenny made the decision to sign the players we were never informed and i'll never blame King Kenny. 
We signed Downing for 20 million ( no output)
Carroll for 35 million ( not effective, only suit possession direct football)
Bellamy (Free transfer)
Henderson (13 million to 16 million, again no output)
Coates - 7 million (huge potential)
Enrique - 6 million (suits more direct football)
Adam - 7 million (suits direct football)

We didn't do very well last season. The club decided to part ways with the legend and reset itself. We hired Brendan Rodgers with that vision and to implement that philosophy of possession football. We also wanted to focus on bringing our own players through the academy. However, the players from our last regime were unable to be shifted out. Many of our goalscorers (Kuyt, Bellamy, Maxi) opted out before brendan rodgers could come in. 
Hence we find ourselves with a thin squad. In all honesty the club should have given brendan more money to fill up the gaps needed.

The 3rd Doctor once implied he was ""thousands"" of years old. The sixth Doctor also had his own number cited but I can't recall it. In *The Doctors Wife* it's implied that the Doctor has been traveling with the TARDIS for 700 years which means his first incarnation was well over 100.

Plus, Tennant is the only Doctor to establish that regeneration as the same as dying. And I think that was just his particular incarnation's interpretation- each incarnation would take it differently. But all other Doctors say they are the same person with a different body. It's only 10 that claimed it was just like dying. Well 1 didn't say anything about it obviously but all the other mentions of regeneration by other Doctors.

edit: Also, no matter how many years in each incarnation he spent, he is still currently centuries old and none of us know what century old beings are ""supposed"" to look like.

11, on the other hand, just constantly does fairly dumb and/or ill-considered things.  The entirety of the last Christmas episode is probably one of the better examples:  You're telling me you think it's plausible that a (roughly) thousand-year-old being who loves humans would NOT realize that an unguarded glowing Christmas present wouldn't make it through Christmas Eve unscathed?

Not to mention, even if it had, what would have happened?  The kids would have walked hand-in-hand into an acidic wasteland, because The Doctor didn't even bother to jump ahead a day to make sure the planet would be safe for children.  ""Merry Christmas, kids!  Melting for everyone!""

The precise nature of the regeneration limit was never explained in the classic series - whether it was a natural limit (i.e. Time Lords couldn't simply regenerate a 13th time), or an enforced one by the High Council of Time Lords. As you pointed out, some Time Lords (like the Master) were promised regenerations, implying that if the Council had the power to bestow regenerations, they could similarly take regenerations away, and/or stop regenerations entirely. 

I personally like to think the limit is a natural one - that when a Time Lord reaches his 12th regeneration/13th incarnation, that's physically it, one more death and he/she is done - but that's just me.

The problem is that he is tweeting this to 100,000+ other people, not just Enrique and his friends.

Like it or not, the reality is that we now live in an age where any outward facing publication from anybody affiliated with the club needs to be treated as PR liability.  It's the modern day equivalent of printing your views in the newspaper for all the world to see.   It just sucks because the reality is twitter is often people speaking their mind without giving careful thought to their words like someone would writing something for print.

Just imagine if this tweet had been sent by a prominent member of the first team (god forbid, Suarez).  It wouldn't have blown over as quietly.  Whoever is monitoring social networking within the club was right to have it removed given the anti-gay orgs the club is involved in and the way the FA has been picking up on ridiculous twitter incidents lately.  It's not like our PR dept. has the greatest recent history to begin with.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The government could instantly reduce the costs of driving if they wanted

Cars are very expensive machines that don't age well, eventually being scrapped perhaps in a decade when the cost of repair out weigh a newish second hand one. The cost of insurance is always going to be high, the cost of policing the roads is always going to be high, traffic lights, lighting, resurfacing, all cost a lot of money. The human cost is always going to be high. I disagree that it is about taxation.

&gt; I suspect that cars cost more simply because they are a better means of transportation

Cars have required so much special infrastructure to be even remotely viable. We could decide tomorrow to decouple from combustion engines  and build infrastructure that makes mass public transport just as good.

&gt; But if I'm going to travel 10-50 miles to go outside of town, the only time (and probably cost) efficient way is to drive.

The major reason that you need to make those journeys is that the car allowed for that particular pattern of building/amenity distribution. If the car hadn't been invented and we still had trams and a good rail network (that wasn't cut back to only the most profitable of lines), then the journeys made, and where things were built would reflect these transport vectors. You'd likely be in a similar position regarding not being able to see a better alternative.

I'll give you an example: in America the suburbs were deliberately built with long-ish commute times by car, because back then it meant only the rich (ie white) could have the resources to locate there. I even came across (I forget which book) of deliberate low bridges to prevent the passage of busses (ie black people). THe car was no natural winner but a contrivance.

&gt; That happens any time a huge number of people use anything.. there will be a minority of morons.

If you are very unlucky you might suffer a broken wrist. Comparing the typical pedestrian versus car impact is not a fair one to make.

&gt; But as soon as it was raining, it was a horrible experience.

We drilled a hole to France. We could make cycling comfortable even in the worst of weather. Again mudguards can be perfect.

&gt; It seems to me that a lot of your points are based on people using cars for really short journeys through cities, which I agree is stupid.

People don't actually like cars. They don't like living on main roads. They don't like looking at or hearing motorways. They don't like walking or visiting areas where they have to interact with traffic. They don't like people parking on ""their street"" or outside their house. My points include everything, but mostly the commute either to school or work. The average is something around 45 minutes, which gives a [yearly total of about 219 hours per year](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2061409/The-average-worker-spends-weeks-year-commuting-statistics-reveal.html). That's a massive hit on productivity. Yes, home working would help here but many could not do this, but see also the school run. You are also not solving the problem of a lack of income if people stopped driving—the road system just couldn't be maintained. Insurance companies would suffer, police would be cut, oil companies would go bizerk—all things I would happily welcome! But the loss in commute makes the car fail as a transport paradigm.

&gt; The car is just so convenient and liberating. Taking public transport feels like punishment.. it's worse in pretty much every way.

It's worse because it was designed to be worse. The car is liberating (kind of) if you can afford the nice house off the main road, the car it self and you don't have a job that requires you drive to it. You also have to be lucky to not get into an accident.

true,Guardianista,cnty-uk,London/Exeter,"I think its worth putting paragraphs 71-73 of the executive summary in here for comparison:

71.

  It is worth being clear what this legislation would not do. The legislation would not establish a
body to regulate the press: it would be up to the press to come forward with their own body
that meets the criteria laid down. The legislation would not give any rights to Parliament, to
the Government, or to any regulatory (or other) body to prevent newspapers from publishing
any material whatsoever. Nor would it give any rights to these entities to require newspapers
to publish any material except insofar as it would require the recognised self-regulatory body
to have the power to direct the placement and prominence of corrections and apologies in
respect of information found, by that body, to require them.

72.

What would the legislation achieve? Three things. First, it would enshrine, for the first time, a
legal duty on the Government to protect the freedom of the press. Second, it would provide
an independent process to recognise the new self-regulatory body and reassure the public
that the basic requirements of independence and effectiveness were met and continue to
be met; in the Report, I recommend that this is done by Ofcom. Third, by recognising the
new body, it would validate its standards code and the arbitral system sufficient to justify the
benefits in law that would flow to those who subscribed; these could relate to data protection
and the approach of the court to various issues concerning acceptable practice, in addition to
costs consequences if appropriate alternative dispute resolution is available.

73.

Despite what will be said about these recommendations by those who oppose them, this is
not, and cannot be characterised as, statutory regulation of the press. What is proposed here
is independent regulation of the press organised by the press, with a statutory verification
process to ensure that the required levels of independence and effectiveness are met by
the system in order for publishers to take advantage of the benefits arising as a result of
membership.",0,1354362075,null,0,false,0,c79k7r4,t3_143kx9,t1_c79k7r4,t3_143kx9,null,1430548986,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

Crackers are paper tubes that make a small bang when you pull them, they look sort of like a traditional twisted sweet wrapper, a cylinder with 2 thin points, sort of like this &gt;=&lt;. These are usually pulled before dinner, everyone gets one, you hold one end each and the winner is the person who gets the main body of the cracker. They contain paper crowns, crappy jokes, and usually some little tatty toys, though if you spend more you might get something a bit better like nail clippers or a small deck of cards. if you have read Harry Potter they have magical ones that give out much cooler hats.

Some people light up their houses, those who go the whole, TV Christmas style, hog, with figures and moving bits and bobs are usually looked at as total cocks.

It is difficult to say about things you wouldn't do as the media brings a lot of American ideas over here. I guess maybe the food is different, you seem to eat most of a traditional Christmas dinner on Thanksgiving so I would expect some differences there. 

Food is traditionally turkey, though rarely it might be a goose, roast potatoes and parsnips, pigs in blankets, stuffing, vegetables of many kinds; carrots, peas, broccoli, runner beans, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, cabbage, onions, leek, squash. We might have chestnuts, though sometimes they are in stuffing, possibly yorkshire puddings, gravy, cranberry sauce, bread sauce. Obviously not everyone has all of these things, but as far as I can remember that covers most things. As a vegetarian we normally have a nut loaf in place of the turkey.

You underestimate the sheer farce that is the Work Capability Assessment. Granted the guardian has a bias against cuts and IMO it took the wrong tone in focussing on one person's story so much instead of using raw numbers.

Mandated work placements are a minefield. The DWP gains because they're off benefits, the Providers gain because the DWP gives them money and the employer gains because they get free labour. Whether the poor sod who actually has to do it gains is less clear. Certainly they'd get some experience and a potential reference but would their job chances be improved? Certainly the use of this free labour for employers would deter them from hiring but then the job is only lost if said employer would have hired a paid employee to do the job of the slave.

After about 11pm on Christmas eve they show carol services and Midnight mass. Apparently it's very calming while going through the stress of wrapping up all the last minute presents (source: my Dad).

On Christmas day you get Doctor Who, Christmas Top of the Pops, the Queen's Speech, and a few other shows that are similar to the ones on on Christmas Eve. There's also a lot of war films (mostly the Great Escape but there are others - I do get confused as to whether they're on TV or if my Dad's watching them on DVD, though), as well as Die Hard, Back to the Future, etc.

So I'll try my best to answer your questions, that I can, I'm not an expert in employment or family law.

If someone is HIV+, they are under no obligation to tell anyone. However, after all my research, I would definitely recommend telling anyone that they're considering engaging in any intimate acts. 

In your hypothetical situation, if a guy with HIV meets a girl and wants to have sex with her, unprotected, then, yes, he should inform her of the risk, if he himself is aware of it. If she is not informed, and she contracts, if the courts can prove it was done with malicious intent, and there was no way she could have contracted it from anywhere else, then the case could end up in court.

However... if his viral load is low enough, or he used, or wanted to use a condom, or did not know of his serostatus at the time, then that is enough of a defence, even without informing his partner. If the partner was informed, then clearly, the partner was aware of the risk.

HIV+ have a lot of stigma attached to them, which can make coming out with being HIV+ difficult.

It's all about mens rea and actus reus - basically, in England and Wales, for a crime to be committed, someone has to think about the crime before it occurs (not just have it happen by accident) and also actually commit the crime.",0,1354367540,null,0,false,0,c79kohd,t3_143jni,t1_c79kohd,t1_c79kgdp,null,1430549206,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

""On the surface it's about an alien called 'the Doctor' who travels through time in a spaceship that looks like a police telephone box. He saves people and other aliens with the help of his companions and a tool called the sonic screwdriver.

But it's so much more than that. It's a show about friendship and bravery, love and loss, life and death, forgiveness and guilt. About being human, and less than human, and sometimes being a bit more than human. About the need for skill and intellect, and sometimes a little bit of luck; finding the extraordinary in the seemingly ordinary, looking up in the night sky and realizing you are part of an impossibly beautiful and mysterious universe and that you don't have all the answers, no matter how clever you are. It's about looking inside yourself and realizing you are far greater than the external conditions of your life; you're not just a shopgirl, you're not just a successful medical doctor, you're not just a temp, you're not just a little girl who needs to grow up or a boy that thinks the love of his life could have done better; you're the most important person in creation, and at the same time the most insignificant. And having the ability to choose between the two at any given time is fantastic. It's about embracing your inner darkness so that you can stand in the light of your own beautiful truth. It's about having the guys to do what's right even when everyone else just runs away.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Okay everyone's talking about Lucas, but looking at this lineup, it seems like Enrique's back to playing full back. Why? Enrique gets his ass in the box and he got a goal (and nearly two) out of it. Shelvey does the same but his finishing is quite questionable.

Also, why is Allen playing if Lucas is playing (vice-versa)? Unless Allen pushes forward more (which was apparently what Rodgers wanted), or we play an awkward formation of Lucas, Allen, and Gerrard in one straight row. However, Allen doesn't seem like the type to put in slick through balls like Suso or Sahin. I would definitely much rather Suso or Sahin start this game. Heck, with Allen's recent form, I'd take Henderson over him this game, to give him a break.

Wisdom isn't starting. I'm not sure why, Southampton don't have strong wingers like Hazard/Mirallas/Bale to tear us apart on the right, this *should* be one of those games that Wisdom should be starting in. While I would take this lineup against teams with strong wingers that terrorise Wisdom due to hiis inexperience.

I really hope Sahin or Suso gets subbed on. Sahin isn't going to be happy moving from one bench (at Real Madrid) to another (here at Liverpool). While Suso is definitely a talent and I don't think he was quite happy to be taken off before the first half for Henderson against Wigan. I'm kinda afraid that he might be poached sooner or later if he isn't kept happy with some playing time.

To be perfectly honest, I'm actually kind of glad this finale was only regular episode length long. Any longer, and I would have just been an emotional train wreck.

But no; they just wrapped it up and got to the end.

I was honestly dreading the episode where Amy and Rory had to leave, because after Series 5, the show *had* to be Eleven, Amy and Rory in the TARDIS. That was the show. That was Doctor Who now. I wasn't even thinking about the fact that *other* companions only had a finite time with the Doctor. Doctor Who wasn't about a time traveling Doctor with *various* companions anymore. Doctor Who was about Matt Smith's Doctor, Amy, Rory and River.

Then Steven Moffat announced ""their story would end""... And much feels were had. Giant reality check that Doctor Who is about change.

So I am glad it wasn't a giant two parter finale. I'm glad it was sort of casually done. They had about 30 episodes to build up that relationship, more than any other companions, and seeing it end in a giant movie length story would have been *too much*.",0,1354373235,null,0,false,0,c79lcoc,t3_143hhe,t1_c79lcoc,t3_143hhe,null,1430549521,23,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,23

- for once its not the offense that everyone is slagging off. i think we can all agree that torres looked streets ahead of what he's been at points this year. another performance or two like that would be great, unlucky not to score, even though some of his efforts were tame. looked lively/up for it.

- even though we conceded, i would have taken a holding midfielder off instead of moses, drop oscar deeper and have marin/mata/moses. mikel didn't have a great game, and threw the defense into some bad positions.

- given the scoreline, i thought we looked pretty solid at the back for most the game. the first goal was unlucky to not be given a foul, seeing as the ref was calling that on both teams all game. the second goal was amateur defending, allowing diame to be that open. all last year we worked on not allowing shots to get off right at the 18yrd line (bayern/barca/napoli games). 

- dave is looking a real threat forward, and solid at the back. even when jt gets back i'd like him to keep his position. MOTM for me, some really big blocks and stops on jarvis, kept him quiet for a long while. 

- good to see marin, who genuinely seemed up for it, i'd like to see a start in the near future.

losing sucks, but if we can work out the kinks this early in the season, get a good squad rotation going, bolster (either through returning loans or MINOR purchases) in january, and start working back to front together more, there is no reason this season can't turn around. regardless of the scoreline, i think there are many many positives to take from this game. i just wish more fans would see it that way.",0,1354373584,null,0,false,0,c79lem4,t3_143qoh,t1_c79lem4,t3_143qoh,null,1430549546,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Also, its not BR's job to make Sahin happy. Its BR's job to win and if Sahin is on poor form he shouldn't be played. He won't stay with us, he will just go back to Madrid and play CL football every year and dominate La Liga. We're a stepping stone to him for fitness until Alonso it old so he can replace him.

- Suarez has the bossing of Yoshida for the most part as well.

- Lucas is still very under-done, which shows in his passing. But his defensive presence, and what it means for allowing everyone else to get forward, has really improved Gerrard and Allen's performances, especially Gerrard's. Still, people need to get into the box.

Also, it would be interesting if it were just the companies who joined or whether it was individual writers as well who, in joining, basically say they will uphold the ethics of the governing body. That would essentially eradicate those who don't join as it could work like the American Writers' Guild, where there's a list of ""Unfair"" companies (in this case, maybe ""Unethical"" companies?) and it's against the rules of the guild for any of the writers to work for these companies.

This means that writers are dissuaded from permitting conditions that are against the governing body's guildlines, as they'd have to sacrifice their membership (and therefore credibility) in the first place, and also the companies with these problems would be encouraged to change their ways to have a wider pool of resources.

There would also be the ability to ""blacklist"" repeat offenders, so that the general public could boycott those papers/press outlets/writers if they wanted to.

A must for kids but a treat for adults. I (23) opened the first door of mine today and so did my partner (26). We also have one in work as it is a small company :)

&gt;Cracker?? What the hell is that?

Crackers are decorated tubes that  two people pull apart and the person with the bigger section wins (like a wishbone). Inside (aka the winnings)
are usually a paper crown, a joke/trivia card and a small prize such as money clips, bottle openers, dice, key chains etc. 
Our family always have them around the table, one next to each plate so that we can pull them before dinner. However, since I am not having a dinner at my house and going to my parents, I cram my crackers in the tree as decoration. They will get pull in the morning with my partner before we leave for my parents'

&gt;Do you guys light up the house and yard like the Griswold's in Christmas Vacation (plastic Santa's &amp; reindeer)?

In Wales at least there is always that one house on the street that goes all out. However most places use lights outside. I love when people use lights and such but I hate plastic figures. The kids however, love them.

&gt;What seasonal TV specials are on over there? We get Rudolph, Frosty, Charlie Brown and of course 24 hours of A Christmas Story on Christmas Eve/Day.

This will have to be something someone else will answer because we don't really watch TV at Christmas, except of course for Doctor Who now.

All this and we are all atheists. I often forget that people associate this holiday with Christians.

I think the Private Eye website which basically says 'buy the paper' is kind of emblematic of Hislop, and his attitude towards Leveson. His entire career from his mid twenties is and has been ripping in politicians and the media, but you also get the impression that he is a man of that world. He is not a radical, he is not activist, he never seems too concerned that reforms go through. In fact, you get the impression that he has grown up in an environment that he dislikes immensely, but has also kind of grown to love, for its foibles. He likes exposing media nonsense, but doing something meaningful to actually combat it would be, er, not cricket. He would rather carry on playing the game.

That doesn't mean that Private Eye isn't excellent, and Hislop an important, courageous figure, but it does mean that he shouldn't be considered the oracle of all things.

Or, to make a more substantive point, lost in amongst the debate about the difficulty of drafting such a law, or the apocalyptic effects of 'state controlled media', is that systems like this work very well in other democratic, developed countries. Something like ten British papers also operate in Ireland, [under almost exactly the proposed system](http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/1201/1224327341316.html).

Beginning: Oscar is boasting about how good he is at Call of Duty and FIFA and always beats Luiz, but David claims they barely play FIFA against each other. Oscar lets Luiz pick the game because he does not want to embarrass his host.

While playing Grid: Oscar says the pressure is all on Luiz. He spins and luiz makes fun of him. after the race luiz makes sure the cameraman records the results. Oscar: ""what ever

When playing Pool: Luiz keeps boasting and making fun of oscar and makes sure the cameraman is recording after every good shot. When Oscar misses Luiz says he is blind and Oscar claims there is something wrong with the table. When Oscar is under the table ( a bet perhaps) luiz jokes by pretending oscar is  a dog. 

When the food is ready: Luiz :"" This right here is the only reason he visits me"" Oscar: "" Of course how can i pass afternoon snack!""

Well the salaries for Graduates range from 25k to 38k, depending usually by the field they work in - and the quality of the graduate they are expecting, I assume.


33k seems to be the tax allowance limit, with a 20% income tax in this braket, leaving around 2200 pounds per month. Very reasonable, from the looks of it, the rent ranges from 600 for 1 room studios to 1000 per month, if you want to share it.


25k on the other hand leaves you with 1666 at the end of the month. If you drop 600 out of those on rent, food and other expenses (tube pass), I assume you're not left with much at the end of the month. I don't plan on going to any Michelin joint pretty soon, hehe. I am just curious if 25k is, not sure to be honest, enough for a decent living? I assume you'll say depending on what my habits are and how frugal I can be, but if you need to stretch every meal and probably live paycheck to paycheck, it will probably get to you at some point. Ah well.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"The problem is that it is not a coincidence that politicians, the media and the police are closely intertwined. Politicians and the police, at least in the upper, political echelons, have a lot to gain from being friendly with the tabloids, and a lot to lose from making enemies. First, look at gifts and the revolving door. The person who led the initial police inquiry into phone hacking, Andy Hayman, was taken out to dinner by News International while he was investigating them, and after retirement was hired to write a column by NI (in which he attacked the claims made in the Guardian against his conduct). He maintained until the bitter end that there were 'perhaps a handful' of hacking victims.

Second, look at the power of media generated perception: the papers have within their control the perception of the police, and the perception of the competence of major police officers. The police want the media on side when the following sort of incidents happen:

* Jean Charles de Menezes - the papers printed the day after the killing that he jumped over the turnstiles, ran down to the platform, and was wearing a bulky bomber jacket with wires hanging out of it, all of which was fabricated.

* Ian Tomlinson - the papers printed the day after the killing that the police were uninvolved, except in so far as they tried to provide medical assistance to Mr Tomlinson, while protestors threw bottles at their medical team, all of which was fabricated. 

Also, read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_police_role_in_phone_hacking_scandal#Personal_relationships_and_potential_conflicts_of_interest) about the way in which the relationship with the media defined perception of the competence of two Met Commissioners. The latter, Iain Blair, who made it clear that links with the press were unnacceptable, was subsequently forced out (ironically by tabloid darling Boris Johnson) because of a public perception that he was incompetent, at least partly generated by the tabloids.

There are also the practicalities of these enquiries. You're asking police to investigate and ultimately jail other police, and also for police to uncover journalists' sources. If bribery is carefully managed between a journalist and a police officer, there is very little chance that it could be uncovered - hand over a few hundred quid, cash in hand, meet in an anonymous place where you will not be recognized, and no names go beyond the two involved. It doesn't take a genius to do something like that without getting caught.

Ultimately it comes down to: why would you expect 'just apply the laws' will work this time, when it has repeatedly failed in the past?

The fact that they have become self-aware and non-psychopathic enough to become the paedophile equivalent of ""celibate FOR LIFE"" leads me to respect them.  Active paedophiles can rot in hell.

true,junnies,null,null,"Here's my take

Reina 7- Kept a clean sheet, distributed well, looked assured and composed in goal

Agger 7- Solid defending against an ordinary southampton side, won us the game with a fantastic header

Skrtel 6- Solid defending against an ordinary southampton side

Enrique 8 - Amazing workrate as usual, played a pivotal part in most of the chances we created, defended and attacked superbly

Johnson 8 - Some great dribbles and tackles, constantly an attacking threat down the right

Lucas 7 - Defensively he was class. Usually we look vulnerable when we lose the ball because Allen is defensively poor and gerrard can't be arsed/is too tired? to track back and defend but with Lucas we always looked secure. Gave the ball away more than occasionally though.

Gerrard 7 - His vision and passing was incredible at times, but still displayed usual signs of laziness/tiredness?/ and lack of concentration

Allen 6 - Had good and bad moments, but nothing that really stood out. 

Shelvey 6 - Had a cracking shot and made a great run but otherwise a mediocre performance

Sterling 6 - Gave us plenty of movement and width but poor decision making/lack of composure in the final third cost us at least a goal or two.

Suarez 8 - Immense as usual but his finishing just wasn't there today. 


Hendo(sub on 69) 6 - The usual. Great workrate, but nothing special otherwise

Carragher (sub on 88) 6 - came on too late to make any sort of impression.

Overall we absolutely dominated Southampton but our inability to be clinical in the final third made this game way closer than it should have been",0,1354385966,null,0,false,0,c79nuf3,t3_143w94,t1_c79nuf3,t3_143w94,null,1430550699,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Yes, language evolves, but it does so due to concensus. These people are perfectly within their rights to lash out at it, especially with the two moronic examples you've graciously provided. Changing ""literally"" to mean ""not literally"" is fucking idiotic. You wouldn't change ""yes"" to mean ""no"", would you?

And using someone's sexuality as an insult is grounds for a solid punch to the face, as far as I'm concerned.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; I can't see the new regulator being anything other than another establishment body which does nothing to stop the kind of collusion you are talking about (how can it?)

I can explain roughly how it would alter the dynamic, using an example. One of the stories I heard about at the time was a girl who had gone to the police to say that a footballer had raped her. The police sold the information to the tabloids, who turned up on her and her parent's doorstep, shouting through the letterbox about the rape, and doing the standard 'talk to us and we can present your side of the case' line, which is an implicit threat that if the target doesn't give an interview and allow pictures, the tabloid will savage them.

The new body would alter the dynamic in two clear-cut ways:

* It would provide a means for the victim to push back against the press, to say 'if you libel me I will go to the regulator, and they will sanction you'. This is the arbitration process, which makes libel-like proceedings accessible to the general public. At present, a lost libel case can mean paying legal costs into the hundreds of thousands of pounds, and poor people have no serious recourse should they be libelled, or threatened.

* It would provide a place for the gathering together of data on less clear-cut ethical abuses, which could then be investigated, and published. Rather than there being all these individual cases of borderline abuses, the regulator can assemble them together, investigate, organize the information and establish the facts, and publish it, at least as an anonymized block. That means that the press are immediately shamed for bad behaviour, rather than the current system, where thousands of people have their lives destroyed, before a sufficiently media friendly case comes up (like the Dowlers) and there's a hysterical purge, once every ten or twenty years, and in between, periods of zero scrutiny.

As far as The Doctor coming back when Amy remembers him, well, memory. In Moffat's Who episodes, memory is supremely important. Amy's memories specifically. She grew up with a crack in her wall, a crack that had all of time swirling around and in her. Because of this her memories are extra powerful. 

So, The Doctor implanted the old saying her head to represent the TARDIS: something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. The TARDIS is all of those things. When Amy got to the point where that saying was repeated over and over, her memories got tripped. She had always remembered him as an imaginary friend but that phrase helped her remember him as real and since her memories are super powerful, they brought him back to life.

Once the cracks were closed, her super strong memory was also able to bring back her parents even though they had been erased by the crack. Different cracks seem to do different things and apparently this crack only wanted to give Amy superpowers and steal her parents and act as a portal to a prison. 

Can you tell I don't like the cracks? I don't like the cracks. Moffat has a tendency to throw out logic for the sake of story and it bugs me even though I love a lot of his episodes. You just have to suspend rationality. 

**tl;dr**- Amy has superpowered memory thanks to the cracks and The Doctor helped her remember using the old, new, borrowed, blue phrase. Take it or leave it.",0,1354392567,null,0,1354394843,0,c79pc0d,t3_1440oi,t1_c79pc0d,t3_1440oi,null,1430551464,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The fellow is *alleged* to be a psycho.  That means something.  We have presumption of innocence.  Obviously, that doesn't come in front of protection of children - which is why the kids were taken away - but until a court has decided they are to be *permanently* taken away, they need to be treated in a way that means they could be returned back.  Did you see the bit where they had already been *returned* from foster care to the parents before?   So they've possibly been subject to allegations that have proven to be false before.   And that time, the children had forgotten how to speak their native language in the interim?  That wouldn't happen with older kids, so it indicates the kids are quite young, at a crucial stage in language development.

The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with capitals altogether.

Carlo Cudicini: Same deal as Gomes. His wages aren't very high and he won't command a high enough transfer fee to bother shopping him around, so we can keep him until the summer, when he'll presumably retire.

Brad Friedel: Has a place in the squad until he decides he no longer wants it, in my opinion. Will be #2 for the foreseeable future imo.

Billy G: We won't get a significant fee for him, and we need the depth for the tail end of the season, when his contract will expire anyways. Keep, I say, but I doubt he'll get another offer.

Bongani Khumalo: Seems to be settling in well at PAOK and has claimed his spot in the first team, but seeing as he's already 25 and hasn't even had a sniff of first team football here, I say see if we can get him a permanent deal there. Sell, if possible. 

Daws: Keep the hell out of him. Seems to actually love the club and is a good leader. Unless we can get an absurd sum that we'll *turn around and spend on another CB immediately*, I don't see a reason to sell him, and the last thing we want to be doing in January is a massive overhaul of the squad, especially if we continue our good form into the window.

Naughton: Keep. No question about it.

Adam Smith: Find him a loan for the rest of the season. Sherwood is convinced he's the real deal. I'll take him at his word for it.

Danny Rose: Season-long loan, so that's not up to us in January. I'd like to keep him, though.

David Bentley: Doesn't figure into our plans, and it's painfully apparent. Sell if we can. 

Jermaine Jenas: Sell to anyone we can. He's out of a contract next May, so it doesn't really matter much either way, since I don't see us getting more than ~3m pounds for him.

Simon Dawkins: Looks like he'll be going to San Jose on a permanent basis, which is a good move for him, I think. 

Tom Huddlestone: We don't have enough depth to sell and he's still a quality player when utilized correctly. Keep. 

Jake Livermore: If we bring in another central midfielder and Scotty seems fine after getting back from his injury, I'd love to find Livermore a loan until the end of the season in the PL where he can get regular playing time. He needs to play, but he's not yet at the level he needs to be to feature in our midfield, and I think he has potential, he just needs more experience.",0,1354397102,null,0,false,0,c79qdfk,t3_1443u3,t1_c79qdfk,t3_1443u3,null,1430551953,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

I've tried expressing this before but it's more complicated than that. Being a football supporter is **not** about blindly supporting the manager no matter what happens. It's about supporting the club. And the manager and club are not the same thing. You can still be loyal to Chelsea and dislike Benitez. **They are not the same thing.**

To reiterate what ryanmeachen said - we deserve to be able to voice our opinion. Football supporters have been voicing discontent for years. Would you see the United fans behind the Yellow and Green scarf thing were shit fans? Of course not - Manchester United is their passion, and they are motivated by wanting what's best for their club, as all true fans should be. At the moment, it does not look like Rafa is the best thing for the club. 

Cheer on the team by all means, but this does not mean giving blind support to Benitez.

a: non-EU non-Commonwealth foreigners here on holiday.  maybe Americans or something.  they are found to be abusing their kid like you say.  answer: deport them.  temporarily put kid into foster care until kid can be handed over to the foreign country's social services.

c: the same, but they are legal immigrants with a work permit, but they haven't been here very long.  the same: deport/handover.

d: the same, but they immigrated ten years ago and the kid is relatively old, speaks english as well, and is part of british culture:  that's the difficult one, isn't it.  i wouldn't want to be the person to make that decision, and i'm glad i'm not.

* The earthquakes point - produces earthquakes which are similar to a lorry driving past a house 

* The 'fire water' point - those are for people in the states who get water from their own well, and in any case natural gas doesn't dissolve in water at room temperature and pressure, so there is no toxicity threat. Those people just need to add vents, which are in any case quite common in areas with hydrocarbon geology.

But there are a lot of genuine issues, particularly involving the composition of the fracking fluid (in America the composition is not revealed because of 'commercial secrecy'), properly checking the integrity of the concrete well casing, and what happens to the dirty fracking fluid when it's been pumped up. In America they often just leave the fracking fluid in plastic lined ponds, and hope for the best. As long as it is properly regulated, and the cost of handling waste streams is fully priced in, I'm okay with it.

Edit: This is worth looking at:

Essentially, he needs to decide what he wants. Is it results or style? We've been through too many staff members in too many positions, too many ideas, not enough of them have stuck. Bringing in a manager who is renowned for defensive tactical football and winning without style is the antithesis to his actions and seeming demands of the last 5 years.

These performances were happening under RDM but Cech and most the defenders in our team were playing well

What happens when Cech has a poor game? What happens when the usually defensively perfect Cole makes a mistake ?  THIS

This isn't an isolated incident, maybe I can forgive Cech, Cole and Ivanovic for having a couple of bad moments in a game because they have been excellent recently

Can we stop all the Torres hate

1. One he is our only option 

2. Sounds daft but under Rafa he has improved every game heck he might even score next game 

3. Torres for once this game was the least of our problems and besides Moses was one of our better players

4. This game he actually got a respectable number of shots of considering in the second half we got majorly bullied


A lot of people are blinded by stats and bullshit, I said after the West Brom game that Hazard's form has been in decline and so it continues

The bigger picture at chelsea, this is actually the first season at chelsea in which it might actually be acceptable to make excuses for RDM and Rafa alike now

WHy Chelsea have only used 20 players I believe this season, which is the lowest by any club, that screams of a lack of depth

Selling Raul Meireles was a mistake, he can shoot from distance something Ramires and Mikel can't and he passes better than them

Injuries to JT and Lampard has hampered rotation as well

The players are probably tired its simple to see, Mark Bosnich yes Mark Bosnich actually made a good point about chelsea pre game vs West Brom when he said something along the lines of 'one of the biggest mistakes RDM made was playing a near full strength side vs Man U in the league cup'

This actually brings me to the realisation that Chelsea this year are actually in transition, we have a small squad which is making players tired, as with our lack of options upfront we have a lack of options in CM which has been a problem for longer than our striker situation.

The positives is that unlike in previous chelsea seasons when we have these dips and the talk has been is the best behind these chelsea veterans, are they past there prime?

At least this season we can see the best is still to come for most the chelsea squad

And I still do--I watched ""A Christmas Carol"" with my family last night and I had to fight back tears because it touches me so much. I really needed a hug.

Basically, he's my surrogate father, just like Amy. The common thing you'll see about Doctor Who is that people like to envision themselves traveling with this guy because he's cool, and I guess the new series hasn't really helped the romance angle. But to me, it's more of a family relationship. I need someone to lean on and talk to about these views of life and childhood because my parents honestly aren't that comforting when it comes to that (it's not their fault and I love them, of course).

I feel like a Time Lady sometimes (though I haven't found a fob watch...I'm still looking, hoping I'm secretly Romana). Everyone grows up! They leave me! Some things are locked in the past and won't be the same again, but the fact that they past isn't faded away or not important is comforting, even if I still can't go back. I have faith in humanity; no one is unimportant because they will mean something in the whole of the space-time continuum. The people dearest to me are human, and they make mistakes, but I love them anyway for who they are.

true,CJ709,present,,"First off, this is an awesome post. Such a good discussion starter. I am going to go through the team starting at the back. Sorry for the long post, been thinking about this all season.


GOALKEEPER - I would sit down Cech and hear his thoughts on what has gone wrong so far. He is the current stand in captain and clearly one of the smarter players in the entire squad. He has spoken out about his dissatisfaction at results and I think more players look to him then we realise. His position is safe and I would seriously consider making him full-time captain depending on Terry's return.


DEFENCE - Firstly, inform Ashley Cole that he is a part of my long term plans and work to finalise a two-year contract. Remove zonal marking that Rafa put in and return to having a deeper two centre backs with Ashley Cole being allowed to attack again, but Azpilicueta remaining a true RB until he is more comfortable in the team. I have liked Azpilicueta so far and so he keeps his spot. If JT is fully fit I now have four centre backs that I have to pick from - JT, Ivanovic, Cahill and Luiz. Every time my confidence grows in Cahill he has a bad performance so for me he is a sub. In which case Ivanovic and Luiz start with JT replacing Luiz upon his return. Due to his age I would play JT more sparingly - potentially starting him only in the CL and big Prem games ala Maldini at AC. 


MIDFIELD - Now this is a huge conundrum. I would install Mikel as a anchor man in midfield, informing him he is not to roam at all. When he sits even deeper he will be told to move to the left side of defence, meaning JT/Luiz moves to the middle and Ivanovic to the right. I think we get a lot of issues where Mikel is the lone central man and that solves this somewhat. Romeu would be his sub and would start easier games such as LC and FA cup early rounds. I would then play Ramires as a box-to-box midfielder, but would seriously be looking to buy in someone else with my first choice being Fellaini. Ahead of him I would play Oscar in the true 10 position. He would be given free rights to roam and pull the defence apart. As Lampard returns I would consider playing Lampard here in certain games where keeping formation is more key. Wide left I would play Mata who can be rotated with Marin when speed is more important, and wide right I would play Hazard to be rotated with Moses when power is more important. I know Hazard plays left but he doesn't defend. Ever. So he is being played infront of the more defensive Azpilicueta, and as discussed above Ivanovic assists to the right when Mikel comes deep so this helps too.


ATTACK. Right. Let's get this over with. I play Torres. Today is the 1st of December. I tell him he has one month to prove everyone wrong. I will start him every game until January 1st at which point we meet again and talk through how it went. I don't believe he will play well and in turn will then start Sturridge, and look to sell Torres (for around £15-20 mil) and buy in an £8-15 mil striker for rotation with Sturridge. I don't want a Cavanni type player, I want someone who scores simple goals. Give me the next Lineker and I will rip your arm off. I don't recall Lukaku, he is still too raw. Another 1/2 a season at WBA will do wonders for him. I do call him though and tell him why I have made this decision and that he is in my plans for the future.

SO...

FORMATION:

-------------------------CECH----------------------------

--AZPILICUETA----IVANOVIC----JT/LUIZ----A. COLE--

----------------------------MIKEL------------------------

---------------RAMIRES----------------------------------

----------------------------OSCAR-----------------------

HAZARD/MOSES--------------------------MATA/MARIN

-----------------------TORRES---------------------------

SUBS: TURNBULL, BERTRAND, CAHILL, ROMEU, LAMPARD, MOSES, STURRIDGE


BUYS: FELLAINI and a rotation type striker. 


LONG TERM: Try to send Courtois to Arsenal on loan next season to get prem and CL experience. Recall De Bruyne and take a serious look at Marin again. Send McEachran on loan to a prem team next season, someone like Newcastle would be perfect as long as he gets games. 


TL;DR I want to bring back some stability to the back four (five in this instance as Mikel doesn't roam at all) and free up Oscar to play a role where he finds space on the pitch for himself. Try Torres for a month but plan on cutting my loses.

Azpi, Ivan, Luiz, Cole
Ramires Mikel Oscar/Lampard
Mata Hazard/Marin
Hazard/Sturridge

Torres would be done.  Thanks you for your service, you earned one very important corner kick and it was worth every penny we paid for you now go away.  I would Send him to the person willing to pay the highest percentage of his wages and we would pay the rest.

When January comes around I'd sell Sturridge to the highest bidder (can't let him leave on a free) buy someone like Bony or Remy or possibly Lorente.  I'd spend the bulk of my January money going and getting Fellani.  If we can get two cheap strikers great if we can only get 1 recall Lukaku.  I'm fine carrying only 2 strikers and having Fellani available as an emergency option.

I'd switch back to a 4-2-3-1 after the pickup and be very flexible position wise depending on match ups.


Back 4 I'd stick with Azpi, Ivan/Terry, Luiz, Cole

Hazard/Mata/Marin would rotate at the wide positions of the band of 3 while Oscar/Fellani rotate in the middle slot.  The pivot would consist of Ramires/Oscar/Mikel/Fellani depending on match ups.  Oscar and Fellani would interchange between the pivot and band of 3 as needed.  Allowing us to attack with the fluid rotation of Mazacar some points and at others to slide Fallani into the box as a target man for crosses and long ball outlets.  

In some games Ramires/Moses get used on wings if more width is needed or there is an especially dangerous attacking side from our opposition.

Lampard can finish the season if he wants or go to LA now.  Cole gets a 2 year extension and I buy a young option that can be our #2 LB within that 2 year window.

1) Terry is probably the only natural leader in our squad, when he's injured, we look mentally frail and can get bullied out of games.

2) We don't have enough cover in the central midfield position, plus Lampard is the only player we have in that area who can control the tempo of a game, without him, we generally don't play as well.

3) We essentially have three number 10's in Oscar, Mata and Hazard. While they are all great, some of their ability is lost when 2 of them have to drift out to the wings.

4) Torres simply isn't doing the business right now. Plus, we only have one other striker, this is simply not enough. Look at Man Utd, they have 4 quality strikers in Rooney, Van Persie, Hernandez and Welbeck, if one of them isn't playing well another one probably is. With us, if Torres isn't playing well, we're fucked.

5) our squad is much too thin in almost every area, especially up front.

These are all problems caused by imbalances in our squad. Until we can take action in the transfer market, all a manager can do is try and motivate our players. ",0,1354413652,null,0,false,0,c79u11g,t3_14452e,t1_c79u11g,t3_14452e,null,1430553676,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

When the tardis exploded everything in the universe was affected by it, except for the Pandorica. For that reason the Pandorica can (on a small scale) reverse the universe-destruction-effect for things. The Doctor combined the Pandorica with the omipresent tardis to amplify the universe-restoring effect to the max and restore everything back to normal, but since he had to be in the tardis for that effect he would be at ground zero and be erased by the cracks himself, the restoring universe would literally close around him. 

&gt;Moreover, then he suddenly comes back to life because Amy thought of him

When things are erased by the cracks, they disappear and people forget about those things.

The most important thing is that we need to have right player of the roles, as I see at the moment, there’s too many square pegs in round holes. 

First we have to have an **objective**, how would we like our football to be played – or rather, how Abramovich would like our football to be played. And the answer is like Barcelona, a largely possession based game perhaps with a physicality, speed, and intensity suited to the premiership.

**Goalkeepers**: Not much to be fixed there. Cech is great. His distribution could be improved upon but that is also contingent on the movement of our defenders, mids, and attackers. 

**Central Defenders** : A possession based game like Barcelona, Swans-elona, and Brendan Rodger’s Liverpool’s wet dream requires defenders that are comfortable on the ball, willing to play out a tight spot, and adept in going forward. Spectacular last ditch tackling abilities is not the highest badge of honor there. 

**Terry** is great on the ball but his lack of pace renders him incompatible with the system that is almost synonymous with a high defensive line. Cahill is much in the Terry mould. Ivanovic and Luiz tick most of the boxes. Some things can be improved, such general passing play and in Luiz’s case, defensive concentration but the basics are there. 

Interestingly Rafa selected Brani and Luiz for his first two games in charge and Luiz only missed out on the third versus West Ham due to suspension. 

**Fullbacks**: Cesar and Cole are very compatible with the system. Both are great passers, bags of pace, great in defense and dangerous going forward. 

**Midfielders**: The midfielders are the most important pieces in the system. They need to be good all-rounders, defending, marking, covering, passing, shooting etc. A pure defensive specialist has no place there. 

Mikel is a vestigial appendage left over from the Makalele era. Mikel is good at most defensive aspects but is woeful in attacking contribution. He slows down our transition from defense to attack with his slow passing decision making. His lack of pace is also a concern in ability to cover wide ranging holes in such a fluid system. 

Romeu’s technique and passing is much better though also lacking in pace.  Lampard still has to offer to team (not the least his onfield leadership) and it’s not a coincidence that his injury matches our decline in form. Ramires has shown himself to be capable of various skills and roles, but is being one of the defensive midfield his best position?

**Attacking Mids/Wingers:**

This is one department where we have tried to emulate the Barca system with a now large contingent of physically diminutive but supremely technically gifted players in Oscar, Hazard, Mata, and to a slightly lesser extent Moses and Marin. 

I don’t have much more to add then what has already been said. A bit more tracking back would be nice. Oscar is the most complete player of the lot, possibly suitable for a deeper role. However, his harassing of opposition deeplying playmakers is crucial. Hazard and Mata prefer to be reverse wingers, cutting from the line. Employing a more direct true winger in Marin or Moses or keeping the players on their ‘natural’ side can add width and increase the number of crosses into the box (as we have seen)

**Strikers**: 

Torres is the most out of place player in the system. He’s best in a counterattacking side with plenty of space behind the opposition centrebacks to exploit. His pace had papered over a lot of his shortcomings but like another ex-Liverpool forward, Owen, once that’s gone through age and injury there is nothing to fall back. Del Bosque, the high priest of the possession game, recognizes this by repeatedly dropping him from the Spanish side to point of not even playing with a striker at all. 

Sturridge’s movement, pace, and goal scoring instinct all top Torres’. In a possession based game, physical presence counts for a lot less than technique which Sturry has in spades. And Lukaku is not just a battering ram. As his stint at West Brom shows, his pace and technique is just as good. 

**TL;DR/Conclusion:** The best utilization our existing resources. 
4-3-3, for more directness in attack, quickness in transition, and steel and coherence in the middle of the pitch.

Merlin as a woman had me laughing so hard my brother came in to see what I was dying about. And people wonder why Merthur is shipped...Colin can play feminine really well, and that was very over-the-top cross-dressing. Loved it! 

I also enjoyed the interaction between Arthur and Merlin. While they'll always have that joking and sarcasm, Arthur really looks to and trust Merlin. I also felt that Arthur is starting to piece together that, at the very least, something is special/different about Merlin. 

I really enjoyed Mordred also. I was hoping they'd have some fun head-speak, and I'd love for them to get along, but I also commend Colin's acting and how he is keeping his cool around 'enemies'. 

Did anyone else notice that Dragoon/Emrys's voice was different, than what it normally is when he plays the old man?

Probably an idea Moffat had for a while. I did notice and interesting scene in which Amy noticed that they were bring ""staked out by an ice cream van"" and the first thing the vendor says is, ""it was supposed to be 'Claire de Lune'"". This song is inspired by a poem ‘Clair de lune’ (‘Moonlight’) which is from Paul Verlaine’s early collection Fêtes galantes (Gallant Parties, 1869).

roughly translated the poem is as such:

Moonlight

Your soul is a select landscape
Where charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go
Playing the lute and dancing and almost
Sad beneath their fantastic disguises.

All sing in a minor key
Of victorious love and the opportune life,
They do not seem to believe in their happiness
And their song mingles with the moonlight,

With the still moonlight, sad and beautiful,
That sets the birds dreaming in the trees
And the fountains sobbing in ecstasy,
The tall slender fountains among marble statues.

The final stanza of course mentioning the tall slender fountains among marble statues.

Except there are no fountains in Leadworth, there's only the duck Ponds.

So 10 was exactly the person he wanted to be, he loved his current incarnation, he loved life, he saved people. And after all that crap he went through and trying to avoid his 4-knock fate, he still died because someone played on the thing he would always do- save people.

It is a bit of a slap in the face really, no matter how arrogant one is. To be *expected* to sacrifice yourself? That sucks. Obviously 10 would do it gladly, but when suddenly it's expected of you, it's much less gladly given.

10 said he was dying because he knew that he would be a drastically different person. Still the same, but a whole different personality. Which sucks when you think you're the ""perfect"" incarnation. When you're the exact person you want to be...

When Rose brought back Jack, she zapped him with energy from the time vortex. It wasn't exactly that she made him immortal, but as the Doctor states in Utopia in season 3, it made him a fixed point. That means he cannot be changed or removed from his timeline, which is why he can't die. 

I believe the Face of Boe actually DIED died because by that point he was estimated to be over 5 BILLION years old, and his time vortex energy had dissipated. You can even fit this in with the laws of physics. While energy can neither be created or destroyed, it can be dispersed. As Jack states at the end of season 3, even though he cant die he has noticed that he has been aging. ""The occasional grey hair here and there."" So while the process is greatly decelerated, over 5 billion years it stands to reason that the energy would slowly eke out, allowing him to finally actually die.

Chelsea fans should be angry at Roman and the board who sack RDM and appoint Rafa

Do you actually think the players care about who the manager is to a degree. The players by now know that Roman is practically the manager and actually a new manager brings opportunities for players to shine and become one of Roman's favourites 

Now you may ask yourself why become one of Roman's favorites ? Heres the answer you can be a striker and not score for 10 hours (he did play well enough btw vs West Ham) and still be a regular starter and still be given every single chance to succeed and make a shit ton of money, good enough reason for me

I went in to one a few years ago looking to buy a car amp that I wanted to wire my IPod into directly. I asked for some information from one of the staff, explaining what I had in mind. They just looked at me with utter confusion and in slight panic declared that they didn't really know anything about the products beyond demonstrating them. So Darren, a more knowledgable member of staff was sort to provide an answer to my most perplexing of questions.  
I explain again what I was after, seeking recommendation as to which of their fine products was most suitable. Darren informed me that, if I was to plug my iPod into any of said amps, it would in fact explode, as the amps are just too powerful for it. This amused the first employee greatly, relieved by the fact it clearly wasn't their lack of knowledge that had caused the confusion, but that I was obviously some kind of nutter asking for the impossible. ""Erm, I don't think so."" I replied ""there may be an issue with the output of the iPod being too low, in which case I can solve that with an old pre-amp / equaliser I have. But that may not even be necessary, if you can tell me the minimum input value for the amp we could find out."" A familiar look of befuddlement now took to Darren's face, whilst the first employee had moved on to angry, who was I to dare question the great authority of Darren. The manager was sort.

As far as I can figure out, the position is this...

Energy companies are offering deals to landlords. If they can bring in lots of energy customers, they get a bonus. The advice given is to not tell tenants they have the right to opt out, to try to suggest and let them believe they don't have a choice, and to emphasize the good bulk deal.

And *initially* the deal probably is quite good for the tenants too. But once you're in, it's harder to switch, which allows the energy companies more freedom to ramp up the prices on that package later.

So basically, it's the same deal as usual - if you don't check prices regularly and switch when there's better deals about, you'll get screwed. Just more so, because it's that bit harder to switch (or at least it seems that way) once you're in the trap.

Many people I know will mute ads or use the pause button on their set top box and then skip the ads entirely. I know one couple who will record a programme like X Factor, and then start watching it 20 minutes late so they can skip ad breaks...

I just checked and the number of minutes per hour for the UK is [limited based on the kind of license a broadcaster has and changes for peak/off-peak hours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement#United_Kingdom). Maximum it's 12 minutes. The most popular channels off-peak are capped at 7 minutes per hour. The [equivalent story for the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement#United_States_of_America) actually makes me sad for Americans.

Most Europeans on encountering US television for the first time tend to get a bit weirded out by the amount of advertising. I think it explains a lot of US consumerist-based behaviour at a societal level, but when I was visiting my Dad in my teens (he lives in CA), I found it so maddening, I'd prefer to just not watch much TV.

Meanwhile foreigners who spend Christmas in the UK seem intrigued as to why we are so obsessed with sofas and beds. Because our New Years sales start on ""Boxing Day"" (the day after Christmas Day), and the biggest sales are for sofa and bed shops, the Christmas TV schedule from about the 21st Dec onwards is peppered with ads for sofas and beds.

Since you seem quite interested in the British, I'll tell you something that will become obvious if you ever visit the country or meet a person from the Isles. 


You might find a lot of Brits think they have some kind of superiority over Americans in denouncing their vocabulary, lifestyles and culture but it really comes down to a persecution complex. Patriotism and concerns over the British empire were rife for a long time after the second world war, when we were slowly decolonising. Since the empire shaped so much of our culture (why do you think tea is so popular?) the idea of the British way being best hasn't fully evaporated yet. It's probably why we never joined the Euro and why we hailed the Olympics as the greatest show ever when it really wasn't *that* great. People are see America as the dominant world power and subconsciously feel cheated. Having the stiff upper lip we always had, a lot of this translates into denouncing Americans as ""fat and stupid"" rather than defending Britain. We aren't better than you are and we have a long way to go and a lot of problems of our own. The Greeks had the same attitude to the Romans and it's pathetic really.

It's not irrelevant at all! Just because there are secular countries that have strong religious leanings doesn't mean that other countries that have general apathy to religion aren't subject to its influence in varying degrees. One does not negate the other.

While the UK (in some polls) is shown to have ~50% non-believing/non-religious - with adherence &amp; observation of the state religion making up only a fraction of the religious people - we still have 1/3 of state funded schools headed by religious organisations, mainly the state religion I believe. We also have a *law* that says that all children in England &amp; Wales must attend a daily act of collective worship, of a primarily Christian nature. Now recently there was some hand waving about this law (which is a good sign - most schools ignore it anyway) but in recent years it was challenged, and those challenges were rejected. It *is* still a law. 

We also have (religious) chaplains in hospitals - whose only official qualification is, essentially, that they belong to a religious group, funded by the tax payer rather than that religious group (note: not even the NSS wants to see chaplains *removed* from hospitals, rather they want to the funding (many tens of millions of £) to be provided by the various churches or similar, with taxpayer money going to nurses etc.). Chaplains, though they say they're there for everyone, are there for one particular religious group. Personally I won't have dealings with a chaplain if I'm in hospital, but then again that could be because I don't agree with their being employed by the state. Would it not make more sense to have non-denominational (secular) people, for example trauma counsellors, that can deal with anyone and everyone?

Religious groups are also exempt from equality legislation (Equality Act 2010) - more people have become aware of this recently due to the CoE/Women Bishops vote. Religious groups can also discriminate against employing people because of their sexuality. Faith schools are able to not employ, block promotion and/or terminate the employment of teachers because they are ""not the right religion"" or because of their sexuality. In a *state* funded school, that will have numerous (if not the majority) of children not being members (of families that are members) of that religion. 

Another very important fact is that we have 26 seats reserved in government for (male) religious leaders from one particular denomination of Christianity. While it can be argued that they are a sobering voice on such issues as welfare reform, they have also voted against legislation that conflicts with their own religious convictions (stem cell research, abortion laws etc.). Any MP/Lord can do that (and the other actually), yes, but when there aren't spaces reserved for any other religion/non-religious group as a matter of course, this is unfair and undemocratic.

One small point: When it comes to national activities, parades, memorial 'services' (for want of a better word) - it's generally a CofE lead ceremony, even though the majority of people in the country are either not (active) CofE adherents (either another religion or none at all).

While the influence of religion might not have a directly measurable impact on the everyday life of the chap on the street, it is there and it does have a say in our government and our laws, even though most people don't agree with it or care about it.

TL:DR - I disagree, with added facts. Having a state sanctioned religion results in numerous problems. How many religiously influenced laws is too many?

Erikson on the other hand looks like a good alternative and i'd be very happy to welcome him to the lane. Another Ajax player I would like to see coming in our direction is Alderweireld and if we can land him and Erikson at the same time it would be a massive plus.

I hope all the Scotty P rumours in the media will end up fizzling out because I think it would be really silly of us to let him go especially to QPR (He deserves better).

I really hope we look into Isco as the kid is spilling talent, but the amount of competition from other clubs will be overwhelming.

Willian is another that I hope we launch a bid for.

Lots of universities offer these and you can spend, say, two weeks studying a basic law course at an institution over the summer. This is good for lots reasons: 

1. You can see what is like to live in the UK.
2. You can try out law and see if you actually like it ( you might not! )
3. You can see what you think of the university and whether you like campus/non-campus, city/country etc etc.
4. It looks good when applying to universities

This is much lower risk than signing up to spend 3 years and significant money on a degree in a new country. If it costs £2,000 to avoid doing a degree in a place/discipline you hate, that is totally worth it in my opinion.

I know that the London School of Economics and Kings College London offer summer school and they have law departments. Here is an LSE summer school course in law to get you started:

Licences are issued to premises, not people. Therefore it's easy to compare one list of addresses to another - those that exist but don't have a licence, don't have a licence. Why do you think otherwise?

This is likely to be the ""database"" they big up in their advertisements on the BBC etc - http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/media-centre/video/database-VID7/

Or http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/detection-and-penalties-top5/ - ""We have a database of approximately 31 million licensed and unlicensed addresses. This tells us if your address has a TV Licence.""

&gt; They only know you haven't paid your license if they ask and you say no.

They know you haven't paid it because they know when the address last had one and when it expired. If you buy a TV licence it's going to be recorded somewhere, regardless of if you buy it direct or via PayPoint. You don't have to tell them you haven't paid it, they already know.

I am not a solicitor but I'd assume they ask you to get further evidence - admission is surely even better for a conviction (if circumstances permit) than ""our database says they don't have an address"".

&gt; They informed the TV Licensing authority that i'd recently bought a TV and out they came to see if I was using it for TV programmes.. I wasn't... but i've had hundreds of letters over the years so why didn't they come out sooner?

Probably because it costs money to send people out whereas a few threatening letters might scare people into getting a licence regardless of if they really need one or not. 

I lived in an address that didn't have a licence, we didn't watch TV (except through iPlayer, which is legal since it's not live), all they ever did was send letters.

While Cudicini and Brad are both old guys, I'm not sure either of them will retire. We currently have 4 goalkeepers on our 25 man premier league squad; that's 2 too many in my opinion; those are spots we could be using on other players.

The most pressing issue I see is actually moving out the players who are coming back from loans in Janurary; Jenas &amp; Bentley. Both of them aren't going to get so much as a whiff of first-team action here, so we need to try and sell them so we can bring in Christian Eriksen or some other young playmaking midfielder.

I think Huddlestone is fine, but with Scotty coming back and Tom Carroll looking more comfortable every game, as well as another midfielder (i hope) coming in, he really doesn't have a spot, and is one of the few players we can sell who will have real value; I think we should try to 3 to 5 million for him and be happy about it.

I feel the same way about Dawson, actually; he's a good player, and he wants (and should want) first team time. It's incredibly selfish to keep him here where he's at best 4th choice behind Kaboul, Jan, and Caulker. We have Gallas until at least the end of the season, so we can re-address this in the Summer, but if we can get 8 or 10 million for Dawson, that'll help up have the scratch to go after Eriksen or Clasie or a good young striker.",0,1354462567,null,0,false,0,c7a1dgr,t3_1443u3,t1_c7a1dgr,t1_c79qdfk,null,1430557205,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Time won't die with this universe and restart with the next. Time is time, not a dependent factor on the universe. It is any change, any movement, anything that is any bit different from what was just before it.

Time might not continue forever, yes, but if it does stop, it won't start again. That's a paradox. For it to stop with one universe and then to start again with another, that implies a time period during which time has stopped, a period during which one would hypothetically have to wait  for time to start again.

I wasn't arguing otherwise, save that the UK is more 'official' in its religious aspects. In the US there are many activities (school lead prayers in educational establishments for example) that are (technically) illegal but still take place. They aren't illegal in the UK, but rather the reverse.

true,bcash,null,null,"Yes, but, a corporation is only a set of books.  If these books are all compliant with the various laws and regulations, what's gone wrong?

What I mean is how would things be done differently?  Take the Starbucks example, the reason they paid minimal UK tax was because of the service charges levied on the UK subsidiary by the US parent company.  This is itself a common practice, but eyebrows were raised that is was ""suspiciously high"" - in other words they were using it as an excuse to shift money within it's empire.  How would this be fixed?  Some High Street Food/Drink Industry Regulator quango?  A board of two-day-a-week £500,000 worthies sitting in judgement on how much one component of a company can charge to another component of the same company?

But if that happened what about franchised business?  McDonalds make it's branches pay through the nose for the McDonalds image rights, for example.  Someone like Starbucks could shift to this model, the parent company would keep making a shedload, and the 100 new UK independent franchisees would be barely making anything.

The issue here is two fold: 1) as in the case of the football clubs, just because a company turns over a large sum, it doesn't mean they're scamming if they pay a small amount of tax; and 2) trying to legislate business to maximise tax revenue would be very expensive and wouldn't work.

The only real solution is reduce the paperwork if anything.  There's so many loopholes because there's so many loops, a simpler tax system would have less to exploit - e.g. moving money from A to B just for tax advantages wouldn't be worthwhile as both A and B pay the same level of tax.

true,literallyoverthemoon,eccleston,Eccleston,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time#Time_and_the_Big_Bang

Time is *part of* the universe, it isn't separate. 

There wasn't anything before the universe. To say that there was time, or anything else, before the universe, is like asking what they had on MTV before the 18th century.

'Prior to the universe' is meaningless, as we are speaking from within that universe, and there is nothing outwith it.  However, we can say that if there was no universe, *there was no time*. 

If the universe ends, time ends too. There cannot be time without a universe; the universe is reality, existence itself; there can be no concept of time outwith that. 

There may very well be other universes in existence, and being entirely separate their time would be entirely separate too. These other universes may incorrectly be considered to exist before or after ours, but *alongside* ours may be the most appropriate term. As no time (or space) could exist between them, they could not be relative to, or considerd relative to, each other in any way. 

Therefore if Jack existed in our universe, he *could* not exist in any other, as he is a fact unique to ours. 

He's a fact in ours from its beginning to its end, but there's no reason for him to exist more than once in any one time, so once he exists from beginning to end, he can die. Which is what I choose to believe happened.

Remarkable how similar this is to what I was thinking.

Reading up on it, I'm not the only one who was confused. Apparently the line where Davies created the character, and Moffat actually *wrote* the character, is blurry. Moffat did an [interview](http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/08/doctor-who-steven-moffat-gay) with afterelton.com where both Davies and Moffat are credited with the creation of the Harkness character. 

However, more sources point to Davies coming up with Harkness' uber-sexuality than him being *solely* a Moffat trait, so I'm willing to concede the point that while Moffat filled Jack in (if you know what I mean, *heh heh heh*), Davies was ultimately responsible for Harkness.

I'd also recommend http://volunteernow.co.uk/ as a way of finding something productive and positive to do, in an environment where you typically only meet the very best people (as in genuinely kind).  

As is said below - it depends what you're in to.  The Limelight is coming good again in a big way.  Radar in Queens Students Union, on Thursday nights, is a great place to go to see the best local bands (they welcome non-Queens-students to this event); and you might find a few you like.

The Crescent Arts centre is a great suggestion.  Catalyst Arts too - and the MAC and the Lyric theatre are two great theatres.  

If you haven't heard of the QFT, that would be my other suggestion.  It's a cinema/theatre (http://www.queensfilmtheatre.com/) that shows some great films (ie., not all hollywood), has a bar and a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.

Basically (and this isn't a spoiler; it's been a part of the show for a long time) he got fed up with the rigid Time Lord society and wanted to get out to actually see things. So he stole a TARDIS and ran away, with his granddaughter, Susan. They stayed in 1963 in a junkyard with the TARDIS masquerading as a police box that would have looked ordinary at the time (originally it had a working chameleon circuit, which made the TARDIS blend into it's surroundings, disguised as a differen object). Susan's teachers Ian Barbara were concerned about how strange she was, so they followed her home, met the grumpy Doctor, and entered the police box against his warnings. To prevent him them from disclosing this information he took off, and he's never stopped since, many incarnations and companions later.

There is something major that happened off-screen between the classic series and the revival, but that is part of the story and will be sort of revealed as you watch.

There is really no reason why the philosophies of education have to be so rigid, and so inflexible, and so tied into other policy. At present someone who believes in supply side economics probably believes in rote learning, just because of party orthodoxy. If rote learning works for learning the times table, and that helps for arithmetic, then have a section of the course which uses that technique, then switch back to something else.

The other countries ahead of us are South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore in that order and their students have far more pressure put on them than ours. They have far longer school hours as well and higher suicide rates because of social/familial pressures put on them. Finland is first in the world and they don't have anywhere near that amount of pressure put on them and they've managed it by banning private/fee paying schools, making teaching a well paid, highly respected profession (they need a masters to teach) and promoting equality rather than 'choice and competition'. 

I went to a well-performing grammar school in the inner city surrounded by very bad comprehensives. It was heavily over-subscribed, you needed to pass a test to get in and middle class parents would usually send their child to public schools if he/she didn't get in. Middle class parents would also move homes to get into the catchment areas of good schools and baptise their children to get into Catholic schools and it just created a massive disadvantage for those kids whose parents weren't sharp elbowed, middle class parents or demanding immigrant parents. I think banning fee paying schools would do a lot to fix these problems because those parents would be forced to take an interest in the performance of their local state school rather than opt out and go private. Also all that money being poured into public schools in tuition fees could be spent by those parents on state schools to improve them and if public schools were banned this would be more likely to happen.

I think a lot of people in the country are having this problem right now. Firstly, 10 applications is almost nothing. Hearing back from 10% of your applications would be an impressive response rate. So out of 10 applications, there is no surprise that you haven't heard back. If you've sent 100 and haven't had a reply, start worrying. Until then, it's pretty normal.

My best advice for you would be don't apply for things online. Emails and electronic applications etc are all easily deleted and ignored. If possible, turn up in person, chat to people, leave a good impression and a well-tailored CV. If possible, speak to people with authority and not other minimum wage employees (because they don't give a shit about getting you a job).

Also, who you know is far more important than your qualifications etc, especially at a young age. Network, network, network. Tell everybody you know that you are looking for work. Put it on facebook or twitter or whatever else you use. Your friends might know about jobs. Your parents too, or their colleagues and friends. Does your friends dad have a business? etc etc You are WAY more likely to get work that way than by firing off 100 online applications imo.

true,Clementin,flair7,,"OK I think we have different understanding of what a playmaker is, fair enough. For me, a playmaker is one of the player whom you center your passing game around, a player you always can pass to and expect him to drive the offensive play. A playmaker can be both low (like Alonso) and high (like Özil) in the field.

You say we have Dempsey, Sig and Falque as CAM, but we also have Dembélé, Hudd and Carroll as CM, and IMO they are better. Also keep in mind Dempsey, Sig and Falque is backup for our wingers.

Yes Hudd has not been good so far, but neither has Dempsey or Sig, and if his form is rising he is a good backup as a low playmaker. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Dempsey (oh yes, I'm that brave), so why I'm wishing for a better CAM has to do with this. As far as I have seen (this will say just this year), Dempsey isn't creative enough to be the first choice at the CAM (at a top league team), specially if we are going to play with Defoe at top, it's just to little creativity at the top.

And if we get a low playmaker like Moutinho or Clasie, I'm guessing Dembélé will be first choice for the CAM anyway. So for our first XI or our depth it doesn't matter, as long as we get more creativity. ",0,1354489771,null,0,false,0,c7a7pdh,t3_1458t8,t1_c7a7pdh,t1_c7a6vko,null,1430560278,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I personally expect Danny to make his loan move a permanent move somewhere come next summer.  Don't see him ever being a first choice full back which at 22 years old is something he is going to want.

true,rgalzera,lfc68,,"he did it pretty damn well for 13 games. lets look at some stats shall we.
(all these stats are according to whoscored.com so im pretty sure theyre accurate) 

On average tackles per game he had 2.6, he is ranked #58 in the epl BUT there is also no minimum game requirement for that stat so people who played 1 game are still included. ALSO out and out defenders are included in those stats so they will also have more tackles. in the liverpool squad he is behind kelly with 3.3 (strictly a defender who has only played 4 games), Lucas with 3.3 (our OBVIOUS first choice d-mid who has played 3 games), Jose with 2.8 (our strong left wing/back who has played 8 games), and Andre Wisdom with 2.7 (also only plays defender and has only played 7 games). So... we can say he is good at tackling on the whole considering how many games he has played and playing in an unfavored position.

next interceptions. Again out of all of the EPL with non minimum game restriction he is ranked #30. he is also ranked higher in this category than Daniel Agger who in my mind is one of our best interceptors of the ball. 

fouls. Joe on average only conceeds 1.2 fouls a game. considering his other stats, to me thats amazing. 

For you say he has an almost nil defensive presence is completely wrong. I'm not saying its his favored position or that he should be number 1 because he shouldnt. What i was saying is that it would be foolish to spend the money on another defensive mid to cover for lucas (barring another season ending injury). My point is spending money on a permanent back up for lucas is completely foolish considering he is our obvious #1 and how well joe can do if he is forced to play the position for a decent amount of time. The money would be much more wisely spent on attack minded players considering how low our conversion rate is. in order to win games we need to score goals and we havent been able to do that regularly.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Gross profit is ""how much you sell a product for less the direct expense of producing or buying it"". Pretty much the only direct expense for a ticket to a football match is the paper the tickets printed on.

But you don't pay tax on gross profit, you pay tax on net profit. This is ""what you have left over when all the other expenses of operating the business have been paid for"".

Staff pay tax on their salary and there's VAT though, so it's not like corporation tax is all a business has to worry about.

For most companies, the biggest single expense is staff salary and football clubs are no exception. It really is not unusual to find businesses that have a net profit on the order of 5% or less of their turnover - there are whole industries that would dearly love to see a 5% net profit. Airlines, for instance, frequently make a lot less.

This means that at any given point in time, many businesses are only a few bad decisions from being in real trouble.
