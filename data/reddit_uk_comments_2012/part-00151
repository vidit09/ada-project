*Partnerships in crime*

More evidence uncovered by Private Eye AVAshows that Britain is facilitating breathtaking levels of money laundering through arcane corporate vehicles called ""limited liability partnerships"".

LLPs were brought in by New Labour a decade ago at the behest of the big accountancy firms, which wanted to limit their habilities for dodgy au¬dits but remain partnerships largely for the tax ad¬vantages. They are perfect for those looking to shift dodgy money because they carry the international respectability of British incorpo¬ration but unlike companies, don't have to file tax returns, de- . dare who ultimately owns them or have any ""natural persons"" as directors. And most of them don't have to be audited.
All this has proved ideM lots network of Ukrainian business¬men and politicians behind more than 2,000 British LLPs that have no activities in the UK beyond retaining a registration that impresses the eastem European and other banks used to trans¬fer millions of pounds in and out of the country.

Employing Latvian and other fnontmen as stooge directors, the Ukrainians have long hidden mainly behind two companies, Milltown Corporate Services Ltd and Ireland &amp; Overseas Acquisitions Ltd. These originated M Dublin, where a couple of sh company fonnation specialists, Philip Burwell and Desmond Keamey, were the link between the East European money and the British corporate world, striking deals with registered office providers in London, Binningham, Cardiff, Fareham and °Met-towns to host hundreds of LLPs, no questions asked.

The offshore companies immediately behind them, Milltown and Ireland &amp; Overseas, became peripatetic, moving first to the British Virgin Islands but then showing an address in Belize. More importantly, wherever they were at the time, they would become the partners hi. the 2,000 plus British limited liability partnerships.

Each ELF typically exists for a few years, filing accounts showing tens a thousands of pounds in ""commission"" income from trading in anything from clothes to computers. None has any public profile or unmet presence despite officially being open for business, and how much relationship their unaudited accounts bear to the reality is anybody's guess. Infonnation seen by the Eye from US bank Wachovia, which handled money for an outfit called Clifffierg LLP (registered first in Fareham and now in Harrow), shows transfers of $16in from a Latvian bank, whiM the company's accounts merely repon commission income of 88,876 from business as a 'trade agent for fabrtcs"" for the relevant period.

Hosting what appear to be some of the most active LLPs is an agent in Cardiff called Company Formations Ltd. Operating from a small vacated kitchen shop near Companies House itself, the firm provides the registered office for such ventures as Agrofonn Transit LLP, which in 2009 earned £/.25m as a ""trade agent for food products"". More serious still is Highways Investment Processing LLP, which M 2011 from the same kitchen shop registered office, won a Ukrainian government contract for 9400m worth of oil drilling equipment, for which it has eamed £300,000 commission so far.

Milltown Comorate Servic¬es and Ireland &amp; Overseas Acquisitions have been identified by economic crime specialists as fronts for extensive launderng - of proceeds from illicit
tons exports, drugs, counterfeiting corrupt public contracts and much else - and are gradually being replaced as owners of the British LLPs. Highway Investment Processing ELF is now owned by a couple of Belize companies, Pilon Inc and Agana Inc. Other LLPs have been hansferred - courtesy of conveniently incurious company formation agents and registered office pro¬viders -On companies in the Seychelles, Intrehold Inc and Monhold Inc, and others gill to Marshal/ Island entities Forriond Inc and Prim corona Inc All operate in total secrecy.

It might be thought Mat the woof British corporate law to facilitate such activity would prompt serious concern among the authorities Far from it. Companies House is powerless to prevent the creation of dodgy LLPs, while the body responsffile for regulating the company formation agents that set them up and the registered office providers that host them, HM Revenue and Customs, was unable to tell the Eye of any action taken in relation to the dubious LLP business.

There are more than 50,000 LLPs in the UK, for greater than the number of accountancy, legal and other professional firms for which they were originally intended. But among their users, for entirely legitimate reasons of course, are rtvo of the men in charge when they were being brought in one T Blair and a certain Lord Mandelson.",0,1351707387,null,0,false,0,c6ugdnk,t3_12eskp,t1_c6ugdnk,t3_12eskp,null,1430286074,6,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,6

Are they going to put all this on the ISPs? Or will they put it on individual websites like Facebook?

true,meztastic,flair6,,"I would love to see Toby at Spurs but I just don't think it'll happen this window. And I'm not quite ready to stunt his career (I think he could be pretty damn good with regular playing time, which he is getting plenty of at Ajax) just to have cover at RB as I think Naughton is good enough at the moment for that and Walker will hopefully regain his form from last year. Though if Gallas hangs up his boots at the end of the year (possible) we could do a lot worse than going back to Ajax for another Belgian

And I agree Daws' time with the club is done unfortunately. Good player, great person, but ultimately not good enough for the kind of things Spurs are aiming to achieve in the coming seasons. 

Wings are another area with a lot of depth (Andros, other youngsters could use some time, Gylfi can play anywhere I think) but I think Deuce is better used in the center as he doesn't seem to be a true winger in that he doesn't cross and has a real poacher's instinct and very little creative flair that I like to see in a winger. 

WE NEED A PASSING/DRIBBLING BACKUP CENTER MID SO BAD. Really showed in our last 2 games with Dembele out and in the first couple without him.

What happened was that we briefly met Derren Brown at beginning, and then he left us in a room, we chatted and sat around playing with all sort of stuff they had left in the room (kids toys, crayons etc...). After a couple of hours, a producer said that we were done and ""all would be revealed later"". Derren brown came in and talked with us, asking us about all the stuff we did, looking at the drawings we drew etc...

A couple of days later, I got a call from the producer, asking if we could come in and do a few pickup shots. They explained that the room we were in was a room within a room, and they could remote control all aspects of the room (i.e. change the size of the room, change the colours of the lights, background noise etc...), but they'd do it really subtly so we wouldn't notice.

Apparently, there was someone else in a control room with Derren, who was picking cards which would say things like ""Make someone yawn"", Derren would press some buttons and do something to the room, and then we'd yawn.

We did some pickup shots which included meeting the person who was in the room with Derren.

Looking back, it's very possible that she met us, and then went back to the control room, thinking that we were still there (when we'd actually all gone home), and then they just rigged it, so she'd pick a card saying ""make someone yawn"" knowing that at that point, someone would yawn.",0,1351716250,null,0,false,0,c6uitkw,t3_12efbf,t1_c6uitkw,t3_12efbf,null,1430287283,7,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,7

There is the Jubilee river cycle path a little out of town, but that's gravel and potholey.

Note that the end part goes along the Bath Road. This is quite scary the first time and isn't for everyone. 



If you ride onto York Road, theres a path going down to Homebase, and into the Braywick Nature Reserve. Be aware that this area smells like sewage because 

a. I thinks it's around the treatment plant 

b. There is a recycling/ landfill site around there and 

c. The whole reserve used to be a landfill but was covered over with grass. 

Its actually surprisingly pleasant around there (not the smell). Anyway this carries on down the Bray village. This is the route I take. It's quite quiet and goes across the river etc. Here's another [map](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Barge+Farm&amp;daddr=Route+61&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.514191,-0.65094&amp;spn=0.068477,0.195007&amp;sll=51.501236,-0.60339&amp;sspn=0.017124,0.048752&amp;geocode=FWYqEgMd8m31_w%3BFaLVEQMdMsX2_w&amp;oq=ye+m&amp;t=h&amp;dirflg=b&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;z=13&amp;lci=bike)

Anyway I'm getting carried away. To answer your question here are some places you must visit by bicycle.

* Eton Dorney rowing lake (or the area around it since the lake is closed for a few months)
*  **Windsor Great Park** Specifically the copper horse statue. The view from there is stunning. [This](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/88/246559997_ea303c3de4.jpg) picture really doesn't do it justice. Or [this one](http://imgur.com/ssfap) which I took. It looks down over the castle, London, Maidenhead etc. 

* Jubilee River- this river is actually man made, to ease the flood risk on Maidenhead. It's really peaceful for walking dogs etc.
* Basically anywhere outside of town. If you look on Google Maps you'll see the large areas of green space around the town. On a sunny day anywhere you go is really nice.

I know I said this many times before but whilst staying in Maidenhead you really must visit Windsor Great Park by bike or car. If your relative is able, take them to the Copper Horse Statue on a sunny day and they'll be instantly cured, guaranteed. [Here](http://www.theroyallandscape.co.uk/) is the website.

**Torres has nothing to fear.** Sturridge had a poor game. The stumble in the box was the epitome of his performance tonight. He got damn lucky with the chance that led to his goal and I think even Torres could have finished that. He actually picked up after his goal but still... Nothing more than Torres could offer.

**Dave and Bertrand  look pretty damn good.** Fast down the wings and offering offensive options, much like Ivan and Cole. Very bright futures ahead, and it looks like we have our Wide Defence covered for a long time to come.

**Piazon and Romeu are still rough around the edges.** They're both young and show promise but have a lot to improve on before they'll be considered 1st team prospects. Romeu has a lot of responsibility in his role.

**Dafuq Luiz?** I love this man beyond belief but *why* must he test my faith? He is still making the same silly mistakes which are really costing us. The good news is he is a reliable penalty taker and he seemed to smarten up towards the end.

1/ the longer we stay in cups the more playing time our second string players  get to remind our first string that no one is irreplaceable.

2/ although I am big Mikel fan I felt his head was out of the game, RDM was right to sub him.

I agree that he doesnt fit into the squad, but falque needs more first team action before becoming a constant XI starter, and gylfi needs to make his presence more know. Poor guy was invisible tonight; furthermore when he got the ball, he rarely had a channel to exploit so he did that awkward yet effective stop and turn while shielding the ball from the defender, often times having to knock it back to livermore or huddlefro. Conversely Dempsey was playing way too mobile but when he did drop back to collect the ball he would distribute to walker who would play it to falque. Falque would thunder down the side or turn it inside (causing walker to overlap and pull the defender) normally the ball would go back to walker and dempsey would be in a place to head the ball in the back of the net, but Falque got a bit more creative and basically ignored walker for the most part (i think the overlap was successful twice.)

One day when I was stacking a bottom shelf, I smelt him, and turned around to see which direction to avoid. He was directly behind me, bending down to pick up something from the opposite bottom shelf (a meter-ish away). He had a massive split down his tatty old trousers, which was normally covered by his long coat. I got a full on view of his sweaty, hairy balls and crusty asshole. *Stuff* was embedded into his ass hair.
