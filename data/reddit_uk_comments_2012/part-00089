I just found this freaky group on Facebook of people who hate new Who and call it the ""whoremake"".

And you know, you can get sucked into ""hatemongering"". It's this weird ""I'm a fan of this show and even though I claim to hate this portion of it I can't stop talking about how much I hate it for contrived reasons a, b, and c.""

I definitely got sucked into it with Moffat. I saw these articles online about him, and then a bit somewhere else, and a bit on reddit. There were a couple things that made him look bad (some quotes and lines), throw in a pinch of classic ""fit the facts to suit the theory"" and you've got another weird hatemonger phenomenon.

Well it has somewhat, early on (Macmillan?) they stopped it covering most of dentistry and opticians and prescription charges.

Then Thatcher introduced the internal market reforms, so a market system was introduced for competition between hospitals, etc. which led the way to the lowest bidder contracts on outsourcing, and now some NHS Trusts going bankrupt, etc.

Yeah, it's not that obvious but it has had profound effects.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I see what you're saying, and I actually still need to read that post over on /r/gallifrey about the sexism in Doctor Who. I jut was not up to reading the novel sized post at like 2 in the morning when it was posted :p.

I think part of it is human nature. I mean, as a fan of Spiderman, I *hated* the new Spiderman. For a few days afterwards I was ranting all over Reddit about how bad I thought it was, but then it was out of my system, and I moved on. I still don't like it, but I don't feel the need to go running around telling everyone about it. If someone asks, then I'll tell them how I feel.

For some people, I suppose, this feeling is stronger. It's not just that they feel the need to vent about their anger/frustrations, but they need to find things to be angry/frustrated about, and tell everyone. It's exactly the phenomenon of fitting facts to suit theories. People *want* be angry at Moffat, or *want* to find sexism in popular media, and so they take facts that they can bend into this agenda.

I think the best thing is to just try and find the people perpetuating this. A lot of times you'll find it's just a journalist who wants to find something to get people upset so that they read their material. Sometimes it's people that are easily swayed by someone else's opinion. I think the easiest solution, either way, isn't to try and actively avoid these people/situations.

Normally, governments find it very easy to legislate if they want to put something into law, but now the legislative programme is determined by the coalition agreement, and any change from that must go through a formalized process. That means that ministers will try to do as much as they can without having to go to parliament. I'm sure Andrew Lansley, for instance, would be desperate to avoid being dragged through another Health and Social Care Bill, which has effectively destroyed his reputation. Also, parliament seems to have recently become in general more powerful, for instance with Bercow's frequent emergency debates on topical issues, and the backbench committee having more power over what gets debated in the House of Commons. Which would add to the government's sense of frustration.

It's certainly an important point. The more powerful the secondary instruments are, the less powerful parliament becomes relative to the executive, and the checks and balances within the system cease to function. To take it to the extreme, a system which operates solely through secondary instruments is effectively an elected dictatorship.

And out of interest, *IS* there any proof that teaching kids creationism has any damaging effects on the well-being of the child? I think it's bonkers obviously, but I doubt it has any damaging effects. The kids still grow up being able to read and write, and they can get jobs and earn money. Usually in loving families too. I don't know if teaching them about magical men in the sky can be classified as ""damaging"" or ""abusive."" Besides, parents tell kids about the easter bunny, santa and loads of other bullshit but when they grow up, they figure it out.

true,Von_Baron,null,null,"From working in the Nhs I have some information about you points 
1) This infuriates most people who work in the NHS as well, especially when we have to fight tooth and nail to get any decent equipment.
2) The lifestyle choice area comes from other parts of the government, such as the eat 5 a day, the smoking in doors ban, and the proposed minimum price for alcohol. However most people effected by these tend to be resentful against them, and talk of a nanny state. But I agree there is no personal accountability before getting healthcare.
3) There is a huge amount of competition in the NHS. Not just for people to go to a private company but also between trusts and other hospitals. If their is more than one hospital in a city they will be competing to get as many possibly patients sent there. They do this by trying to keep the cost down to undercut the opposition. The heads of departments in hospitals act the same as in the private sector of trying to take work from other people.
4) I'm sorry about your farther. But people do litigate against the NHS. Often it is for frivolous or even false reasons. Often it is in fact NHS staff who know the loopholes that sue. The NHS also usually settles out of court as well. Which is good for the justified people suing but does tend to encourage the fraudulent.
5) I agree, but the same can be said for treatment of respiratory problems for smokers and liver problems for drinkers. The NHS was set up to help everybody, in all circumstances. Even if people are refusing to take the advice to stop using drugs/drink/cigs. If the NHS did start to refuse to treat certain groups of people it would be as evil as the OP stated.

The issues I see of the NHS are the poor use of budget. Huge amounts are wasted on catering and travel expenditure and the like. However any time there are cuts they come from the bottom. Such as nursing numbers, using 20 year old equipment and when replaced always buying the cheapest not necessary the best value for money (however you can tell when a management meeting is on because of the M&amp;S vans delivering sandwiches). My other problem is keeping bad staff. People are kept in jobs in the NHS when they would have been fired elsewhere. They will have 'incidents' against them, and they be moved to another position but they will not be sacked. Certain departments have been known to keep poor managers for 10-15 years, from my experience in the private sector this wouldn't be acceptable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"While it's true that part of this Terms of Use also prevents use of the Olympic logo and links to their website in a misleading way, the crux is this excerpt from the ToU:

&gt; and agree that no such link shall portray us or any other official London 2012 organisations (or our or their activities, products or services) in a false, misleading, derogatory or otherwise objectionable manner.

The definition of 'False, misleading, derogatory' is very much a contextual one. This inclusion suggests that, should a blog post, Reddit link or otherwise present the Olympics in a negative light or otherwise in a way they don't agree with, they can use the mere fact that the page *links to the Olympic site* as a breach of terms-of-use and try to get the article pulled.

For example, if someone on Reddit were to post a link to the Olympic site in a *neutral light* (i.e. 'Check out the new timetables for the rowing events' - Remember that Reddit links *automatically* add an image from the linked site) and someone else *commented* in a way that the LOCOG thought was 'false, misleading or defamatory', then that would be in breach of the Terms of Use, and the lawyers could be rattled.

This is an incredibly weird idea, and I doubt they'll have much luck enforcing it. It's as if they think that by simply *knowing the fact the Olympic games exist and have a website*, you sign an imaginary 'contract' with them, and all the links you use are their copyright. I'd expect the first time they try to get someone with this clause, the whole thing will get Streisanded to hell and back and all it will do is expose their doucebaggery. 

The whole thing is in contrast to fair use, which specifically has exceptions for 'Review and commentary' - i.e. it's perfectly legal to use copyrighted images, videos and other media  in an article about the copyright holder, regardless of whether it's sway is positive or negative.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I avoid 3D as much as possible - the only two films I've purposely paid to see in 3D were *Avatar* [IMAX 3D] and *Hugo* and in both instances it was to see what the director had done with the tech - Cameron used it in Avatar to disguse the lack of a Script; Scorceses' use in Hugo, on the ohterhand, was to add ""depth"" to the film. Personally while I enjoyed Hugo in 3D, having seen it again in 2D, you don't lose anything.

What's more annoying is IMAX 3D, as it's encroaching on IMAX territory. I'm happy paying £10 to see a film that's gone through IMAX DMR [Where they blow up the picture to 70MM] as it usually doesn't damage the picture quality, and it's worth it - Star Trek looks amazing on 70MM, but when they take a regular film, blow it up to 70MM and then convert it to 3D? Horrible.

But because it's seen as another money stream, more and more IMAX screens are only showing 3D versions - so the likes of The Avengers, The Amazing Spider-man, two films I'd have happily paid to see in DMR 2D, were showing as 3D only, and so I didn't go.

RODOLPH AUSTIN LATEST: The major development this weekend looks set to be the Rodolph Austin transfer swoop. According to this morning’s news from ba.no, SK Brann have confirmed a bid has been received from Leeds for ‘midfield general’ Rodolph Austin. ba.no believe that the offer is around £250,000 and that Brann have asked for a bit more. Brann are keen to agree a deal, though, with the former Tippeligaen player of the year running out of contract this December.

Austin’s agent has told Norwegian news sources that the agreement is likely to go through, while Brann Chief Executive of Football Rolf Magne Walstad has explained:

Rodolphe Austin is a good footballer, but at the right price every player is for sale.

If Leeds are pushed for funds they may be able to negotiate a discount in exchange for granting Austin two final weeks in Norway since Brann will not be able to replace him until the transfer window opens on August 1st. Austin already has match fitness with Brann 14 matches into the season, but Leeds will probably want Austin as soon as realistically possible to blend with a rapidly changing team in time for the new season in late August.",0,1342267358,null,0,false,0,c5dwjx2,t3_whvfe,t1_c5dwjx2,t3_whvfe,null,1429374390,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

The eighth doctor lead the timelords into battle. but the timelock caused them to not be able to time travel. The doctor modified a gun to destroy both races. It was called the moment. He used the moment to destroy both races and sealing the timelock.

""Live"" real ale doesn't travel well -- the yeast dispersed in the beer gets shaken up and exposed to extremes of temperature. Once you've stopped shaking/heating/freezing it on a truck you have to rack it (let it sit and settle) for a few days before you can decant it. And once open, the contents of a cask are exposed to air and may oxidize/go off within a handful of days. 

Now, the USA is geographically huge compared to the UK, and has extremes of temperature (if you're a beer cask sweltering in a railway freight container or freezing on the back of a vibrating long-haul truck). Real ale really *doesn't* like being shipped trans-continental distances, so few US real ales travel (unless they've been pasteurized and bottled). Thus, most of the beers you find in pubs there are pasteurized and filtered and served under CO2 gas pressure: it may be fizzy keg shite, but the quality is consistent despite insults received during shipping. 

However, if you know what *local* microbreweries are producing beer in any given town or city, and where their taps are, you can certainly have a great time drinking some of the best beers in the world.

Selfish Gene theory expands on this by arguing that it is individual pieces of genetic code that determine the path of evolution. It is not some kind of global optimisation, there is no living thing that is ""better"" or ""more evolved"" than another living thing, just ones more or less adapted to survival. 

It doesn't make coherent sense to say ""As you can see from the breeding of any living thing, there are distinct changes in the offspring, these observations are only theoretical"".

One of us initiated and ran a petition, and by last December, the university shaved off about 300 quid from the total rent, and began fixing the complaints we had. We also have more than our fair share of fire alarms. The sensors here are extremely sensitive, and someone leaving the toast on a minute too long will result in the alarms going off. There is no fancy reception like the other private houses; the whole place is taken care of three friendly senior residents.

All that being said, Winkworth house is convenient because of its proximity to the city center and the University. It's one of the few accommodations that has a free pool table and table football. Moreover, I've met wonderful people here and made staying here worthwhile. The mix of students is amazing.

true,lokithecomplex,uk,Edinburgh,"&gt; Even so, since the term 'British' is also one of nationality, its usage implies and underlines segregation even when it is not intended.

Yes those are problems with this and as a result we fudge the issue. Either we say British doesn't exist or say its so mixed that nothing can define it. Which are both disingenuous.

&gt;I usually use the term 'Anglo-Saxon' in this context, though I am aware that it is not so applicable to the highland Scots or Welsh, which do not have such a Germanic ancestry.

As I understand it most British and Irish people are basically related to people that arrived after the ice age, Neolithics. Every human type being around had previously been wiped out by the ice age.

Anglo Saxons offered no more than 20% of the genetic make up. Vikings are another large minority in the genes.

Norman and Roman traces are small.

[A recent study basically said this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Sykes) Though it might be contested to a slight degree.

Though the narrowness of any genetic heritage is no justification for discrimination. But its best to be honest in debates.

Of the reviews which a simple search will show up, only the [Evening Standard's one](http://www.standard.co.uk/arts/theatre/doctor-faustus-shakespeares-globe--review-7425471.html) is more positive than negative, and says of Darvill:

&gt;The intermediary who enables Faustus to make his diabolical pact with Lucifer is the demon Mephistopheles, portrayed by the multi-talented Arthur Darvill. Probably best known as Doctor Who's mystifyingly death-prone companion Rory, Darvill here proves suave, sardonic and ambiguous, a master of ceremonies who exults in coaching Faustus's excesses. His stage presence is unusual: he is ghostly yet at the same time uncomfortably assertive.

As for Dempsey, I think it's a similar case as a player like Kagawa, where you definitely want them for their quality but when it comes to paying for them, you know their shirt-sales and profile are going to offset some of the cost, making them an even more attractive prospect.

It's pretty much the same as negotiating anything else, you need some form of leverage, in this case, the ability to walk away. Obviously it's easier if you've looking at moving in to a place, walking away is really easy. I've gone to view a place, discussed it with the landlord and gout a £35 month discount straight off  just by saying no thanks. 
      
If you're already in a place it is much harder, because it's difficult to threaten to move out unless you actually intend to unless you get lower rent.

*My mother tells me she's never been offended by jokes about the Scottish, yet she's never been discriminated against for being Scottish - she's never been denied a job on that basis, she's never had the police stop her and treat her like shit just because she's Scottish.*

*So if you're someone who has suffered that kind of discrimination, words like ""nigger"" have a lot more power - since school you've had teachers tell you that you'll never amount to anything, since school you were always treated as the troublemaker if one of your peers picked a fight with you. If you go into a store, you're more likely to be treated with distrust by the owner or security guard or by the sales associates.*

*So in a very real way, this kind of language, and these kind of jokes, have a stronger negative effect upon women and minorities than they do upon white men. A white guy can more easily laugh off a joke at his expense and say ""yeah, I'll get over it"" - for someone who is genuinely discriminated against it's going to feel like rubbing their faces in in. They're going to think ""not only do I suffer discrimination, but they get to laugh about it"" - these words and jokes are more likely to make them think ""fuck this, I just have to accept it, that as a minority or a woman, I'm never going to get anywhere with my life"".*

I don't think these words have less power, just because you're a footballer with a nice house and a sports car.

The law on racist language is a statement saying ""racism is not acceptable in our society"" - it doesn't matter whether the guy is rich or poor, it's not ok to say this stuff.

You have the right to your opinion on Henderson/Shelvey but I'd love to listen to the reasoning. In any case here is my reasoning for my high hopes for Henderson and why I rate him higher then Shelvey (keep in mind though, Im in no way bashing Shelvey and in no way suggesting he won't succeed, but Id rather put my money on Henderson):

* Henderson has appeared in 108 PL matches vs 28 (all with Liverpool, I can probably count on one hand the amount he has started)
* 21 U-21 matches several as a captain and 5 international apperances vs 4 U-21 matches
* Henderson was selected by FIFA one of the 13 young players to look at in the year 2011
* Just look at him! Look at his qualities, they are all qualities that ""stick with you"", natural if you will. They are all qualities players will struggle and hardly improve over the full length of their careers (in short how athletic he is). If you then look at the areas he is lacking in you'll see that most of it is likely to improve drastically and most of it looks like he lacks confidence.

Henderson has still yet to prove him self as a successful buy, but I don't see a reason for him not being able to live up to the price tag. Keep in mind he is 22 years old, with a solid track record and is likely to be able to play for us the next 10 years.

I find that people who say Aquilani has played well for us are delusional on the topic (I am in no way trying to offend you). He never really performed in a single match, even though he had one or two great passes. I think people are rather focusing on the good moments and forgetting the bad ones.

To be honest I don't want Aqualani, Cole nor Adam in the XI, they all make good squad players. Cole has an advantage though because he is more versatile. 

On Adam, I sure as hell want him to succeed. I just don't see him being able to succeed. He is basically the opposite of Henderson, but they both need confidence.

true,DrTenochtitlan,null,null,"This, of course, is very subjective, but here would be my list of classic stories that are MUST-see:

**First Doctor:**
**An Unearthly Child** (The very first episode of Doctor Who ever)
**The Daleks** (The second episode, and the first with the Daleks)
**The Dalek Invasion of Earth** (The second Dalek story)
**The Tenth Planet** (The first episode with the Cybermen, the last story with the First Doctor, the first episode to feature a regeneration. It also, frustratingly, is missing the video of the final part of the four part story. The audio of part 4, along with some clips, do survive though. It is widely rumored that part 4 will be animated and released as a DVD release next year.)

**Second Doctor:**
**Tomb of the Cybermen** (Very few Second Doctor stories survive. This is one of the best, and really develops the Cybermen further)
**The War Games** (The final episode with the Second Doctor. It also reveals the Doctor's home planet and race for the first time, *greatly* expanding what we know about the character.)

**Third Doctor:**
**Spearhead from Space** (The first episode with the Third Doctor, the first in color.)
**Terror of the Autons** (Follows up on Spearhead from Space, introduces the character of the Master for the first time.)
**The Daemons** (An all-around great classic story that is very well regarded.)
**The Three Doctors** (The tenth anniversary special. It features all of the original three Doctors. Loads of fun!)
**The Time Warrior** (Another fan favorite, it introduces companion Sarah Jane Smith for the first time. It is also the first episode to feature the classic villain the Sontarans.)

**Fourth Doctor:**
**The Ark in Space** (Tom Baker at his finest. Just a good classic story. It's so good, you'll first laugh at and then completely forget about a couple of bad special effects.)
**Genesis of the Daleks** (One of the greatest Doctor Who stories ever. We learn about the origin of the Daleks, and see their creator, Davros, for the first time at his maniacal best. It also features a fantastic moral dilemma for the Doctor.)
**Pyramids of Mars** (Another great fan favorite with a great villain.)
**The Deadly Assassin** (A crisis for Gallifrey brings the Doctor home, and we learn more about Time Lord society than we ever will again.)
**The Key to Time season** (This isn't necessarily mandatory, but it featured six episodes with the Doctor hunting for pieces of ""The Key to Time"", an object which could literally control the entire universe. It's talked a lot about in fandom, and it's perfectly good Doctor Who, so it's worth a look after you've seen some of the other must-sees.)
**City of Death** (A fantastic, somewhat humorous episode written by the great Douglas Adams. It is Tom Baker at his absolute finest. Arguably one of the best individual episodes made.)
**Full Circle/State of Decay/Warrior's Gate/The Keeper of Traken/Logopolis/Castrovalva** (This is one of the great story arcs in all of Doctor Who, in spite of having Adric, who many consider to be among the most annoying companions ever. It's exciting, it has interesting plots, great characters, and it provides a fitting end for the most famous Doctor in history.)

**Fifth Doctor:**
(Castrovalva, listed above, is a Fifth Doctor story.)
**Earthshock** (Literally, one of the most shocking stories of the entire original series. The ending of the story left people stunned when it originally aired. Avoid spoilers if you can, and do not watch without watching the great Fourth Doctor story arc I just mentioned above first.)
**The Five Doctors** (The twentieth anniversary episode of Doctor Who features all five original Doctors, and many classic companions and villains. It's a celebration of all classic Doctor Who. Don't watch this as your first episode ever, or you'll be confused beyond belief. It's an episode that true fans will appreciate most, with all of the in-jokes and references to things that have happened throughout the series. However, it is a MUST see.)
**The Caves of Androzani** (The final Fifth Doctor episode, and another great story. One of the few episodes where things get so bad, that the Doctor isn't trying to fix everything, they're literally just trying to survive.)

**Sixth Doctor:**
**The Mark of the Rani** (The final years were not exactly the high point of the series, but this episode, introducing a new villain, the Rani, is better than most.)
**The Two Doctors** (Again, not a fantastic episode, but the final appearance of Patrick Troughton, the Second Doctor, alongside the Sixth Doctor, makes it memorable.)

**Seventh Doctor:**
**The Curse of Fenric** (Probably the best Seventh Doctor episode, it's a pretty decent story actually.)
**Survival** (The last episode of the classic series, and worth watching for that reason alone.)

**Eighth Doctor:**
The 1996 FOX TV Movie (A terrible plot with a fantastic Doctor. The Doctor returns after several years off the air in this failed pilot that most regard as canon. The special effects are much better, and many ideas can be seen in this special that made their way into the new series. Disregard the whole ""half-human"" thing, by the way. lol  Also, you can knock out an entire Doctor in just two hours!)

When Nine changed into Ten, I had a lot of mixed emotions, because Nine was my first Doctor. He made me fall in love with the show. Then there was this really weird guy with a regenerating hand, and wonky teeth. 

Ten sold me on the role and I learned an important lesson that every Whovian needs to learn: Welcome the new Doctor with an open mind. Try to see what makes him so good that they decided on this actor over all the others. 

Matt is a very different kind of Doctor. He's not all too confident, and he's angry and sad. But he covers all of that up by trying to have a lot of fun. This makes him incredibly eccentric. The writing has never been better for Doctor Who, and the way Matt pulls off the insane lines with total believability makes me really enjoy his Doctor, probably more than any other. 

I'm sure a lot of my enjoyment of Matt's Doctor has to do with the writing. I think the best Tennant episodes were penned by Moffat. RTD really squandered a really great opportunity with Tennant, with mediocre writing and trite stories. Assuming Tennant comes back for the 50th, I expect it to be one of the best Tennant episodes ever, because Moffat has had the time to build the context of the story and present Whoniverse around it.

As a consequence, the local town centre, which has been pretty much knocked on its arse as shoppers have adapted to out of town shopping markets [and the Westfield shopping centre a short drive / walk away], and which desperately needs people to use it regularly, has on more than one occasion, been turned into this:

[Video from an EDL rally a few years ago].

I'm no fan of Islam as a relgion, having had the shit kicked out of me for being an ""unclean fag"" by a group of yobs who were thoughtful enough to attend Friday prayers a few hours beforehand. For that matter, nor am I a huge fan of Catholicism.

But I'd stand arm to arm with those same people, before I ever saw the whims of the EDL enacted.

Certain parts of Islam quite frankly aren't compatible with a multi-cultural United Kingdom in 2012, in which everyone should be free to be themselves, and live their life free from persecution.

On the other hand? Most of what the EDL espouse isn't compatible with the notion of what the UK should be.

Fortunately the EDL, much like those who have perverted Islam to meet their own ends, represent a very, very small percentage of people in the UK. And hopefully both extremist views¹ will wilt away sooner rather than later.

10mph below motorway limit is not appropriate for most rural country roads.  Most sensible drivers know this and drive steady anyway, but at least it will allow us to punish those that don't.

Long straight roads with great visibility probably won't be effected by this.  But roads like [this](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=leeds&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=54.055509,-1.961317&amp;spn=0.027056,0.077162&amp;safe=off&amp;hnear=Leeds,+West+Yorkshire,+United+Kingdom&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=54.05923,-1.960708&amp;panoid=FwKLyzKgHDBRKBHTr6ACvg&amp;cbp=12,232.66,,0,3), which are technically 60 mph will.

Speed doesn't kill.  Driving inappropriately for the conditions does.  Most people tend to follow the law so if it lowers speed on country lanes, well so be it.  There's a lot of psychology to it, too many people think the limit signs are the speed you should be aiming for.

Bring on automated driving, even though I'll mourn the loss of pleasure driving.  I hate drivers buzzing me on my bicycle or tailgating me when I ""take the lane"" because there isn't enough room for them to pass safely. But at the same time I love driving fast too.  Too many people can't be trusts to pilot large chunks of metal.

The age of hooning is soon going to be past us.  It sucks because it's fun, but there you go.  Times change.  

Above all else, I think our driving tests should be MUCH harder.  Even though statistically our roads are quite safe.  Each time I'm out on my bike, I still get reminded how poor some drivers are (passing way too close at speed etc).

true,logancook44,lfc12,,"I grew up as an American sports fan. I was, and still am, a diehard Atlanta Falcons, Hawks, Braves, and Georgia Bulldogs fan. Honestly, soccer (I'm calling it soccer to avoid confusion from the other football) is something I never really gave much of a chance, until one day when I noticed premier league soccer was on Fox Soccer. So I started watching. To my surprise, I actually knew the two teams, Manchester United and Liverpool. Manchester United I knew was the big shot team, and I knew immediately I wouldn't like them, due to the fact that I almost always hate the 'best' team (Yankees, Florida Gators, etc,), so I started rooting for Liverpool in the game. One player stuck out, I didn't know his name or position, but he was black, had short dreads and wore number 2 (Glen Johnson), and in this particular match I just noticed he was everywhere. Keep in mind, I didn't rally know much about positioning or tactics, but all I knew what this number two was dominating. I don't remember what the result of the game was, but I remember Glen Johnson leaving an impression on me. After that I started watching more Liverpool games, and I fell in love with the tradition. It just seemed like Liverpool had something that other clubs didn't have; something bigger than just football. From the You'll Never Walk Alone chants before the game, to the history of the club, Liverpool just seemed like the perfect club for me. Three years later and soccer-football is my favorite sport.

60mph is a fine blanket limit for country roads in the UK, not all are safe at that speed, some are safe at above that speed but 60mph serves as a good maximum that doesn't frustrate people and leaves it very much in their hands to go at a suitable speed.

It's also pretty much unenforceable and thus pointless, many people already break the 60mph limit on roads where it's possible to do so, sometimes dangerously so and sometimes not but very rarely get penalised for doing so since these roads tend not to have speed cameras or are busy enough to warrant police speed traps.

I don't mind if people make a clever little cartoon that makes a point about something more specific, such as Lords Reform or the relationship between parties, but this is not it. This is stupid, unoriginal and pathetic.

I know quite a few politicians, activists and councillors. I even know a minister. They aren't evil people, and they certainly don't have ill intentions, whether they're Conservative, Lib Dem, Green, Labour, SNP, or whatever colour they sign up to. They might hold opinions that you may or may not agree with, but that doesn't mean that they hold those opinions with a specific intention to do harm. If we allow political discourse to regress further by popularising some kind of antagonistic caricature of the average politician, we increase the likelihood that we will end up voting someone in who really does intend to do harm.

Talk with your representatives and their activists (they all have them), work out what makes them tick. If you like a particular party, even if they are one of the big three (they are all popular for a reason!), become a member and campaign for them. Put enough effort in and you will find yourself climbing the rungs of those parties.

It is also described that time is so screwed up in the war that time itself resurrects time lords, daleks, and other beings just to watch them destroy each other again.  For anything that could have died or been broken in the time war, it could just as easily be remade.  For example, Gallifrey is said to be destroyed and it is cited many times, but in ""The End of Time"" it is summoned using the (billions of) Master.  Inconsistencies are very common through the new Doctor Who, but they are completely acceptable because they are paradoxes, and apparently paradoxes generally don't break time they simply stress it according to the mass of the paradox (and what aids in handling the paradox--like how the Master uses the TARDIS the first time around).

Offer a gardening or handyman service, and go round people's houses offering to cut the lawn/clean the windows/unblock the gutters etc. 
Sell things on ebay, or set up a dropshipping website (google it if you aren't sure).

Alternatively, think of creative ways to make money, like getting an icebox and filling it up with bottles of water and soft drinks, then selling them on a hot day (if we have one) in the park. 

By setting up your own business, you will learn some new skills, and a lot of business/life lessons from any mistakes you make, which will really serve you well over the next few years!

true,itsableeder,null,null,"Yes. I've done pretty much the same thing as TeletextPear. I always say I'll happily take the property but at £25/£50pcm less than it's on the market for. Usually they go for it, but not always.

Also, I've successfully negotiated a lower/non-rising rent twice when staying in the same property. The first time I was in a 2 bedroom unfurnished flat and had viewed a 2 bed furnished house on the same estate that was managed by the same letting agent. They wanted to put my rent up from £525pcm to £575, yet the furnished house was on the market for £525. I said that if they insisted on raising the rent in the flat then I'd just move out - with no guarantees that it would be to the house that they also managed. The key here, as Snay said, was leverage - they want to keep getting my money, and either way it was going to be £525pcm rather than £575.

The second time I was in a flat that was supposedly ""managed"" - meaning quarterly inspections, should have been cleaned before I moved in, letting agency should approve repairs without me bothering the landlord etc. I had a whole catalogue of issues with the letting agency, including them not turning up to inspect the property when they'd said they were coming - something which cost me money, as I took days off work to make sure I was present when they inspected (long irrelevant story as to why I wanted to be present). To cut this long post short; when it came time to move, I wrote to the landlord with a detailed (and supported, with evidence) list of everything the letting agents were supposed to be doing and weren't, and suggested that it would be better for both of us if I remained in the property but struck a deal directly with him rather than using the letting agents as middlemen. I figured they were keeping a cut of the rent each month as payment for services they weren't providing, and it made sense for him to make more money off the deal by having me pay him direct and for me to stay in the property an extra 12 months without a rise in rent.

Obviously there is an exception to the rule (there nearly always is), and that one may have benefitted. Like those roads that have signs saying ""Adverse camber"" and stuff, or a road near me that was massively crowned and eventually got made less... crowned, by having a level bit of tarmac put in place on the outside of one of the corners. Weirdly that one slowed me down along that road because I was always used to 'riding the gutter' around that corner and suddenly it was smooth.

Oh yeah, people aren't careful, but it's kind of like... at some point you can't keep compensating for the lowest common denominator. Human lives, oddly, have ""a value"" which can be determined to have a specific monetary value. At some point your typical council will go ""No, we're not going to spend any more money on this"" because it'll start costing more money to make the road slightly more safer than it is to just kill someone once in a while. And at this point people will just have to learn to be more careful because the council hasn't forked out for a big inflatable impact structure on their unintentional trajectory.

We shouldn't blame others for the deaths of people that were completely avoidable. Blame the driver for the deaths of any passengers, and blame the driver for their own death, barring exceptional factors like extraordinary vehicular failure or those cases where people overtake on blind crests and shit and just wipe out a family that's coming the other way.

Glad I made you laugh. I aim for my debates to be light hearted at the core. I made a good friend once by fighting them on a bus. I don't catch the bus any more so I argue on reddit instead.

For what it's worth, the work van I use 90% of the time just completed its 20,000th mile since I started working where I work, and I've been there just under a year, and at 20 (just) I'm already fucking sick of 85% of people using the roads. So my ""just learn to drive better"" is not really directed at people who make the occasional misjudgement (I make misjudgements occasionally, but with my mileage that's more often than most), and more at... those people who drive like they are invincible. Motorbikes are generally ok. The last one I saw that was an idiot was on Friday a week ago, on the M4, in pissing-down-rain, with just their 'sidelight' on. The majority of them though I see half a mile off and I get fairly 'left' in my lane (unless I'm in the overtaking lane when I go 'right') so they get a nice wide bit between my van and the lane they're filtering down. Again though, that's nothing special, that's just basic observation really. People should do it more and stop crashing and giving councils cause to spend money making stuff more idiot proof and frustrating for those who are capable of traversing a piece of road at a safe and sensible speed far in excess of the posted speed limit (as would happen if all the roads were posted down to 40).",0,1342310854,null,0,false,0,c5e42rc,t3_wjwp6,t1_c5e42rc,t1_c5e3txm,null,1429378007,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

(And he's faster than he looks; I have no problem with his pace, it's just that he's often running to the wrong place!) What we don't know is to what extent Kenny was sending him out without instructions, and to what extent he was disobeying instructions.

Defensively, he always believes he can muscle the other player off the ball, and when it doesn't work out, he often gives the ball up in a dangerous spot. Presumably Rodgers will tell him when this is OK and when it isn't.

More worryingly, his attacking choices always seem to be wrong, especially when coordinating with the midfielder on his side. When the midfielder stays wide, Enrique gets too close to him and they end up taking the ball of each others' toes rather than doing anything useful. When the midfielder cuts inside, Enrique stays back in defence instead of being the man to add width to the attack. Bad instructions, or bad play? Again, I hope Rodgers can instil some sense of when to make the overlap, when to hit the early cross, when to cut inside, when to stay home.

I'll note that the midfielder in question was often Downing, who had his own issues with low confidence (or cowardice), wanting to get rid of the ball with an easy pass rather than attempt a cross or dribble, and I think the two players brought out the worst in each other. Rodgers tells us he's good at working with players who have low confidence, and he has also said that cowardice is unacceptable, whereas attempting to do the right thing and making the occasional mistake is to be expected and will not be held against you.

""Disraeli's government introduced various reforms, including the Artisan's and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act (1875), the Public Health Act (1875), the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876). His government also introduced a new Factory Act meant to protect workers, the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act (1875) to allow peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the Liberal-Labour MP Alexander Macdonald told his constituents in 1879, ""The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty.""

A Conservative PM who was for the people, not for his rich friends.

But why not look at the bright sides? Firstly, I've seen countless ""Olympic sales"" for practically everything. You don't have to support the Olympics to want to save money. Secondly, there are loads of non-sport focused events celebrating the Olympics, most notably the Cultural Olympiad, which you can take advantage of.

And then, I ended up adoring 9, and honestly had a lot of trouble falling in love with Tennant as everyone seems to, right off the bat.  I found him SO annoying in the first few episodes.  I was so angry about losing Eccleston, especially when I expected him to get more than 10 episodes.  I kind of felt like Rose did, that The Doctor was gone.  That being said, I ended up loving Tennant by the end.  I think Tennant had a good amount of episodes, and because they told you his regeneration was coming, it was a lot easier to deal with for me.  Plus, I liked Matt Smith off the bat.  I didn't expect him to be like Tennant.  Also, I was just much more obsessed with the show by then so I wasn't put off by a change of Doctor.

9 is my doctor because of that feeling I had when he was gone.

If we can get Dempsey then by all means, we take him. He is one of the best strikers in England. However, I still believe that Carroll can fit into a 3 man system. He is very good at holding up the play, laying the ball off, and giving those balls through. The issue we have with Carroll is the fact that we do not realize that he has feet, and can use them well. He has been brought up as a big man with a great head, but that's it. If we can take into account that he can use his fee and will use them well, then we will be a much better team. 

The 4-3-3 formation is a good formation, and will work well now that we have Broni and Downing will do well there as well on the left. The main issue with our team is the midfielders are not supportive enough of the strikers. 

It will be tough on Carroll if he is loaned away, but if they make him work for his position, give no one any special treatment, especially to Suarez. That fight will do both of them some good.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The problem I have with 3D, is that I wear glasses. This means that the glasses never sit comfortably over the specs that I need to see more than a few feet in front of me, and then I get *the worst* migraines just from watching the damnable things. Then, my friends, we come to the price. We really only have the vue here in plymouth, so let me give you a break down of the price, depending upon whether you want standard or VIP seating:

For Standard:

* **Adult** £9.00, or £12.75 for 3D
* **Child** £6.70, or £9.50 for 3D
* **Student** £7.60, or £10.40 for 3D

For VIP:

* **Adult** £10.95, or £14.70 for 3D
* **Child** £8.65, or £11.45 for 3D
* **Student** £9.55, or £12.35 for 3D

So if you're taking the missus out for a night out, you're looking at nearly £30 before you even seen a film, exponentially more if you're in the mood for a bite to eat, and because those geniuses at Citybus have chosen **not** to provide a bus route to the leisure complex, you can reasonably expect to pay a minimum of £5 each way to get there.

The truth is that 3D and Greed on the part of these chains is killing the local cinema. I've gone from 3 or 4 visits monthly, to once in a blue moon if I can't get it on Bluray on import.

true,kdiddlerynd,tennant,Tennant,"No, I totally agree that there is no immediately obvious connection. Which is probably why I didn't even think about the possibility of one until I read, somewhere on this subreddit, the idea that there might be. I think the main reason there would be a connection is because of River/Melody. I think I read someone's idea that maybe the Silence somehow led her to the library, and therefore to her death. 

Of course another possibility is that the title has absolutely nothing to do with the alien race known as the Silence, but by a happy coincidence, they can now make a cross-seasonal, cross-regenerational (is that even a real term?) connection, through River Song. I would be very impressed by the foreshadowing/advance planning that would have gone into it if it was intentional. It is Steven Moffat, however, so I actually wouldn't be too surprised if it was intentional. I think I read somewhere that Moffat had River Song planned for more than those two episodes from the beginning. So maybe he also had the Silence planned.

I guess my main argument for why there are no clues in that episode is because the Silence make you forget when you look away, and the Doctor wouldn't know anything about them yet, as he meets them in his future. River would have knowledge of them, but we've seen her act ignorant before (with Amy and Rory, and also at Lake Silencio), and of course Alex Kingston probably had no idea of her character's  back story, so we wouldn't see it in her acting.

I don't agree with the proposal to reduce the speed limits as I'd rather more attention be paid to educating road users. 

What I don't agree with more however is the attitude you have enforced here. The road is not just for you, it is to be shared. It is public and it will be used as such.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are other possible emergency scenarios too, but in general it still constitutes a risk to the lender.  The need to take advantage of a special offer implies that you don't have rainy-day savings that you could use, and that's something else that would count against you.

If you know that once in a while you need a top-up, I would advise that you stick away a tenner (or twenty) a month, and in 6 months you have a little emergency fund for just that.

A pay-day loan is probably the most expensive way to fund anything, so taking one out does show that you are not taking the best option in the long term.  Mortgages typically last 25 years, so the lender wants to know that in the long term the borrower doesn't waste money.

Or, to put it another way: if 1,000 people take a pay day loan, some of them may have had a good reason - but that number is probably very low.  The bank could spend lots of money investigating each case (and therefore make a big loss on that part of the market when they reject most applicants) or they could just say: ""it's not worth investigating as we spend lots of money doing it and almost always reject the application"".

If Sally wasn't trying to protect the TARDIS, and if we didn't know about what angels are like when they have actual power(Which, at the time, we didn't) then they're just another creature that has the power of inconvenience, at best.

Although you've made me think of an interesting idea, although I don't know how it could be made to span an entire story. The idea, though, would be a 'cult' of sorts that worship the angels, who are able to give them a better life by sending them into the past. People who feel lost in the current time of things, and feel that they better belong in the past. These people actively search for angels to displace them in time.

The twist would be that these people aren't being sent back in time, however, and are actually being killed, as these angels have no need to feed off of them.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Depends on who you ask - 30,000 people who live in and around where I live turned up [and risked getting soaked in torrential rain] to see the Olympic Flame / torch relay a few weeks ago. Included in that 30,000 were around 2,000 who were fortunate enough to get tickets to a special event in a local museum, which saw the flame pass through the streets [Black Country Living Museum - a museum that re-creates life in the Black Country during the industrial revolution through the 1950s]. 

At said event, there was the opportunity to hold one of the torches prior to it being lit and having a photo taken - based on the queue, it seems a few people were interested in it.

Having said all that, of course people will complain - the fact it's called ""**London** 2012"" being the most commonly heard complaint, as it reinforces the belief that it's an Olympic Games for London and the surrounding areas, as opposed to the whole country. People who watch ""the soaps"" and or who aren't huge sports fans will also likely complain, as the Olympics will likely interfere with TV programming.

Basically ask ten different people, you'll get a variety of different answers.

For me? The country is in a double-dip recession, and the twits who're in Government aren't exactly putting into place policies that are likely to see the situation change for the better, anytime soon. We bid for the Olympics in better times - 'tis worth remembering we found out we'd won the bid on July 6th 2005. The following day [This happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings).

Combined with that, whilst the stadiums and support facilities seem to have been built without any significant problems, there's no denying the buildup in other areas has been lacking. God forbid there's a terrorist attack / attempted attack during the Games, given the recent kerfuffle over the security services that are['nt] being put in place.

But having said all that? It's something for the country to rally behind and be proud of. Given the general mood of the country, it's nice to see something positive happen.",0,1342346744,null,0,false,0,c5e9rrp,t3_wl5kk,t1_c5e9rrp,t3_wl5kk,null,1429380754,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

**Just because something is unattractive to look at does not mean it is immoral**. Look at these quotes form the article.

&gt;“Showing these images is absolutely crucial to our campaign. We are determined to fight it all the way.”

&gt;Abort ’67 say their use of graphic imagery is critical in shaping public opinion

&gt;“If we cannot face the pictures how can we conceive of endorsing the reality?”

I could use the exact same phrases and line of argument to oppose open heart surgery, hip replacements, chemotherapy, even *giving birth!* Even the existance of ugly people could be deemed ""immoral"" by that way of thinking. Much more disgusting scenes occur in hospitals every day, only lunatics would try saying that those events are immoral by definition.

Look up images of [Degloving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degloving) and you'll see some pretty nasty NSFL images. Degloving isn't immoral though, nor is it moral, it's just something that happens.

These images that pro-life protesters use are completely irrelevant to the debate, they are simply createing an emotional reaction for viewers and then falsely linking that with their cause. Pro-choice protesters could just as easily use horrifying images of childbirth, miscarriages, stillborns, rape victims and women who died in childbirth to support their cause, and their argument wouldn't be improved or hindered by it - it would be irrelevant.

I'm just happy that I don't have to put up with irrelevant shock tactics any more. I don't want to see these images, and I don't *need* to see them either.

First, never having seen olympic games before, I never stopped to think how massively inconvenient they are.
But mostly, as a person who loves sport, these olympics just seem to completely miss the point. Now it could just be my perception, but I think this time the whole money aspect of it has completely (and openly) smothered the enjoyable sport side.
There were, and still are, a lot of controversy around these games like people being pushed out of their flats because of sky rocketing rent prices, wether or not the railways can take such an increased volume of tourists, the pushiness in telling regular rail users to go find another way to get around london, among other complaints.
So to me it all feels a bit tainted now, like the government is desperately putting on a smile and trying to pretend that England isn't in a horrible crisis, because LOOK! Olympics!

A dinner party maybe, not a house party though.

&gt;Last thing most people want, if they've worked all week, is to have their weekend disturbed by the actions of other people.

Sure, I understand that.  Crazily enough in this time of plenty and automation, work has become such a physically and emotionally draining thing that we need the little tiny bit of downtime we're allowed to keep of our lives to recharge.  However, people recharge in different ways, and all I'm asking for is a bit of give and take.  The extrovert partiers shouldn't be able to make life hell for others any more than the introvert the-planet-is-my-library ""shhers"" should be.  Actually having genuine human contact with your neighbours, finding out what they're like, how their life is organised, what things make them happy and what piss them off, would be a good start to a negotiated pre-emption of most of this unnecessary conflict.

&gt;seemingly stating that others should be prepared to put up with a little disruption / go out of their way, so that people can have parties

Well why not?  If I'm prepared to give you your peace and quiet for 363 days of the year, why shouldn't I be able to ask that you give me a couple of days a year to let rip a bit?

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"First - congrats on the new house.

As to the noise issue - I'm no expert, but I have had to deal with noisy neighbours. The situation with them was vastly different to the scenario you're describing [I'm talking about putting on music at 3AM after they'd gone out to score some drugs, at a volume that woke up people in multiple apartments, across different floors of the building.] and of course, noise abatement teams operate differently, council to council, but on the whole the general issue when it comes to noise, is about the level of disruption it causes.

A simple BBQ in your back garden at 7PM shouldn't be enough to warrant a complaint. If it's just a few people sitting outside, enjoying the weather, talking a playing a little music? I can't see how anyone could have a problem with that - and even if you do have sticklers for neighbours, I doubt they have any real right to complain, at least not officially.

As for the time they came around - if they can hear your friends talking from a parked car around the corner? That's pretty loud.

Do you know which neighbour complained? And more to the point, do you know what the walls are like between your house and theirs? It might be that the walls aren't very thick, in which case noise can travel, particularly if it's an otherwise quiet street.

Nip round and have a word with them - hopefully you've already introduced yourselves to them. If not, do so, apologise for the disruption, and ask them exactly what they could hear, and the volume.

Yes, while it's already being used in mid-Wales on the Cambrian line, it is [proposed](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/12275.aspx) as part of the Great Western main line electrification, along with new trains.

true,Trimethylxanthine,null,null,"If you don't find a paid job this summer, definitely volunteer. Even if you can't find somewhere linked to what you want to do in the future, even volunteering at a local charity shop is great experience to have on your CV. 

You're 16, so I'm guessing you've had maybe 2 weeks of work experience at the end of year 10/11 (That's what my school and other local schools did - guessing it's a national thing). That puts you at the same level of experience as everyone else your age. If you volunteer in a charity shop, especially during the summer when there's less 14 year olds doing it for Duke of Edinburgh, you're pretty much guaranteed to be given loads more responsibility than you'd get in a paid shop job. 

I started volunteering at Oxfam when I was 14. Within a few weeks I was trusted to cash up and after a few months I was managing the music section, training new staff and once was even left in charge of the shop while the manager went for lunch. I've just finished uni and at every interview I've been to they've commented on how valuable that experience was. I only did 4-8 hours a week on Saturdays from age 14-18, with the occasional weekday in the holidays when they were short-staffed.

If you can get experience as a volunteer this summer, you'll be ahead of everyone else your age next summer and will find it much easier to get a job.

**Protip**: If you can't get an 'official' job, you could try babysitting or tutoring - I had one family pay me double the going rate for babysitting because I'd help their two kids (10 &amp; 11) with homework. If you have any younger siblings you occasionally look after at home or you're particularly good at some subjects at school, mention this when you knock on doors to ask if they'd like a babysitter/tutor. Make some business cards with your name, number and rates to give out so you're easier to contact. Or ask round any older/busy neighbours if they need any help gardening/generally doing manual labour.

**TL;DR Volunteer this summer for experience so you can get a job easier next summer. Try babysitting/tutoring/gardening for your neighbours.**",0,1342354478,null,0,false,0,c5ead7p,t3_wkh77,t1_c5ead7p,t1_c5e3ldt,null,1429381034,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If they do not meet that years election promise(s) they lose six months of their term in government. Continue to fail to keep election promises and they lose more months/years.

From your neighbours' perspective: they don't know who you are, they don't know whether you're reasonable people and they don't know what your reaction might be.

If you go asking a bunch of assholes to turn the music down or keep it quiet, you risk them doing the very opposite. You risk them starting an altercation or keying your car. 

So this is why, from your neighbours' point of view, the course of action with the lowest risk is to make a noise complaint, stay anonymous and let the plod have a word.

I personally keep a fairly low profile with regards to my my neighbours - I'm happy to jump start their cars or lend them a battery charger, but I ignore it when I can hear their music because I don't want them getting upset if I'm watching TV late at night. I have no idea if I sound as loud to them as they do to me.

I can't imagine reporting someone for talking loudly in their garden, but I can see why they wouldn't confront you directly. Obviously if you introduce yourselves to them you will, hopefully, humanise yourself to them, and they'll feel more guilty about making a fuss (and less trepidation about approaching you directly).",0,1342355916,null,0,false,0,c5eahz9,t3_wl6ti,t1_c5eahz9,t1_c5eaaef,null,1435701248,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Then of course there's the non stop headlines about how poorly run it all is, how our money (that we've got none of to begin with) is being syphoned off by inept/corrupt/greedy contractors and politicians, how it's paid to build facilities that will have no use shortly afterwards and the sheer level of contempt the organisers have for the ticketholders/taxpayers evident in countless examples of corportate pettiness (brand enforcement etc.) and the way tickets were sold.

There's a lot to it but I think it mostly boils down to this being a bad time to host an Olympics and as is typical of large scale events funded by the public we're getting fucked by profiteering gluttons and told to smile while they do it.

Considering that [13% of maternal deaths worldwide](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/) are caused by unsafe (illegal or legal but inaccessible) abortions, it’s disgusting for a so-called ‘pro-life’ group to make light of the deaths of thousands of women.

Oh I will, will I? 

&gt; You will have a difficult time bonding in a healthy way with future children, if you are so blessed to have them.

Kelly is a very solid defender, a great athlete, and a good all around footballer.  I think that he has played mostly at RB because he has less experience than Johnson and since Kelly is more comfortable on his right, it makes more sense to play the younger player in his more natural position and make the more experienced player adapt.  Either way you look at it, Kelly represents cover across the back 4

Players who can play RB:
Johnson
Kelly
Flanno
Carra

Players who can play CB
Agger
Skrtel
Coates
Carra
Kelly

Players who can play LB:
Enrique
Johnson
Robinson
Kelly
Agger

If Enrique goes down, you usually wind up with a 2nd best back four by replacing him with Kelly

Forgive me if I'm just reading your comment incorrectly but it came across as though you disagreed with their argument.

&gt;Yes, give the child away, great way to solve the problem.

&gt;That isn't you helping, that is you saying use an already inflated system.

That first line of your reply reads to me as sarcasm, which implies that you think giving away babies for adoption doesn't solve the problem of providing care for children that were born into *""families who have no money, and you have guilt tripped them into not get an abortion""*.

I disagree. I think that it does indeed solve the problem you raised. You've responded by (correctly) pointing out that the adoption system in the UK is atrocious, and in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/wl4w8/christian_protesters_charged_by_police_over/c5eajtq) you've gone so far to imply that living through this system is a fate worse than death!

I'm not going to comment on whether or not that is the case; but **I feel obligated to point out that your response supports the argument that the adoption system is in dire need of improvement, but not the argument that adoption will never be a valid solution to the problem of families being unable to raise children.**

Keep in mind that children are only given (or taken) away if the family is unable to raise them, and the children will have a better life in the government system.

&gt;There will be a minority who will get out the system, grow up and do something substantial, proving that it can be done. But what about the many left behind, who suffer depression from loneliness, those who have never got a chance at a normal life, because people like you demand that every pregnancy must be completed, even if it is not beneficial to anyone involved (mother, father, child).

All I meant was that sometimes there are lucky one, in either walks of life, who get there and find a happy life, there are others who do not, which can be especially jarring if there is nobody that has been a parental figure to you, rather than doing it because it was their job.

Children born into a family at least have that advantage, that they are born into a family that wants them (most of the time).

true,thisismyivorytower,cnty-scotland,Edinburgh,"&gt;Forgive me if I'm just reading your comment incorrectly but it came across as though you disagreed with their argument.

I disagree with their argument, what I meant was that their no problems with the points they were trying to make.

&gt;That first line of your reply reads to me as sarcasm, which implies that you think giving away babies for adoption doesn't solve the problem of providing care for children that were born into ""families who have no money, and you have guilt tripped them into not get an abortion"".

No I do feel it solves the problems, however why get to that point, if they were comfortable about getting an abortion, but got turned off by the fact, and the falsifying pictures, that the pro-lifer's show off whenever they make an argument.

&gt;I disagree. I think that it does indeed solve the problem you raised. You've responded by (correctly) pointing out that the adoption system in the UK is atrocious, and in this post you've gone so far to imply that living through this system is a fate worse than death!

I explained this in my other answer, and apologise for making this connection.  This was not my point at all, and I may have exaggerated my reply.

&gt;I'm not going to comment on whether or not that is the case; but I feel obligated to point out that your response supports the argument that the adoption system is in dire need of improvement, but not the argument that adoption will never be a valid solution to the problem of families being unable to raise children.

I never said that adoption was never a valid solution, I feel it is very valid in situations where they are raised in a bad family home, or they cannot be raised in a substantial environment.

My point was having a child, because abortion has been vilified, just to give them away to a possible bad system is the wrong way to go about it.  If they choose that they don't want an abortion, that's fair enough, but if someone wants an abortion, certain statements made by pro-life people can make them change their mind.

true,lokithecomplex,uk,Edinburgh,"I loathe the Olympics.

Or at least did before it was fashionable to, but it feels so mainstream now. I'm not a sports fan though so I didn't think my opinion is relevant. But here's some of my problems with it.

* **Corruption** The Olympics are a business not a charity. That's why they can and do guard their corporate logo so much but its presented as if its some national endeavour. The selling of black market tickets, the drug frauds, the under the table kick backs for contracts and general back room dealing of it all is very grubby. I really wish the hipster Olympics were real but we'd probably never hear about them because the one thing the Olympics doesn't like is competition.

* **Commercialism** Sponsors. Sponsors everywhere. This generally seems more important than the games themselves. Which I am still indifferent to. I really don't need more advertising in my life. I feel like we're closing down streets, spending billions, moving troops so we can hold up a sign thats says ""DRINK MORE COKE FOLKS"".

* **Weird Nationalism** The mainstream thinking on ethnicity and nationalism is so utterly confused. It's generally an all round mess and nobody ever comes to a cohesive system of thought on it. The Olympics are no different. It is allegedly a competition between nations. Where by an athlete competing for nation A who grew up in nation B and who's parents are from nation C but trained in nation D with experts from nation E with technology from nation F which was actually made in nation G. But apparently its really important to all of ""us"" that they beat ""them"" by 0.0000000001 seconds.

* **Londonopolis** Really the UK could not be more alienated from London. It's like another nation. Did it really need the investment. The richest part of the country which benefits from decades of centralised power of the state and private sector. Really that needs investment? Just after the nation bailed the City. If all that wealth can't help the poor in London why will these games help? I'm all in favour of money spent improving land and helping the poor. We are told this is the case but I see no effort to try and employ locals. There are  contradictory demands here. We do the games to help poor locals, often of different generations of immigrants, then employ foreign labour to do the work because it is more efficient. I get the logic but it fails the ultimate goals. I'd rather they spent the money on a better effort to target the poor with work, education and training. Maybe even focus on getting business going not two weeks of running about in fields.

* **Wasting State Money** I don't trust economic projections, post crash even less. We are tricked into thinking it will cost £2.4 billion then told it will be £9.3 billion. They spent half a billion on the media office. Half a billion. Which will then be sold afterwards. But there's a lack of transparency in the project. Who makes this money? Why are we still paying for the building when private sector will make the money?

* **Perverse Promotions** Inappropriate sponsors include soft drinks, beer and chocolate manufacturers. Really for a sports event? In a nation with an obesity problem and saturation junk food advertising? Ironically an event declared good for UK business seems entirely sponsored by foreign brands. CocaCola, Acer, Dow, Samsung, GE. Again I'm not against foreign business or markets but having the state pay for so much of it.

* **Heavy Handed Policing** The bullying Orwellian LOCOG in the machine. Pushing kids near the torch, closing road lanes, intimidating anyone not adhering to the message. Culminating in missiles on flats. I accept it needs security but missiles on houses to play a game of running is farcical.

* **Ineffectual Politics** The reason we get the Olympics is ineffectual politics. The politicians even before the crash were out of ideas. They're offered a lever and they pull it. Its seen to be something. And like workhouses it has to be purposefully useless. They can't interfere with the market and they can't pick winners. So instead we pay for a giant televised advert over a field in which people do some running, skipping and jumping.

Sorry I may have ranted.

Apart from that I love the hullabaloo. If we don't have some live terrorist action, drug scandal, athletic egomania, and the missiles are not let off I'll be really disappointed.",0,1342362866,null,0,1342384475,0,c5ebbr5,t3_wl5kk,t1_c5ebbr5,t3_wl5kk,null,1429381495,84,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,84

The SuperCard has an onboard chip that allows it to fool the DS into thinking it is a game, foiling the vast majority of Nintendo's Anti-Piracy.

It would be nice if we could do the ""ignore them and they go away"" and it worked, but it doesn't. Take the BNP: they won council seats precisely because the political establishment took the attitude you advocate. When they won seats, antifascist canvassing was done and the local labour party typically stepped up to listen to its base for once.

For a street organisation like the EDL, more pertinent comparisons are the National Front in the 70s or the BUF post-war. In both cases the organisations were met on the streets by antifascism (the 43 group, anti-nazi league, AFA etc) and were instrumental in stopping them. More was at stake then (fascists organised arsons, beatings and murders of immigrants and Jews) but the principle is the same.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"The needs of the team should come first, though. If Carroll doesn't suit Rodgers' desired style of play, and Borini/Suarez up front gives us a better chance of scoring goals, then it's Borini/Suarez who should play up front. And if any attacking player deserves to have the team built around them with them in a prominent role, it's Suarez, not Carroll. 

I really hope Rodgers can find some sort of solution that sees Carroll and his preferred system happily coexist. You're right about his heading, his holding up of the ball could still improve but is quite good, and he doesn't need to become tiki-taka-esque to fit into Rodgers' system but he does need better and more intelligent movement. I disagree that his reading of the game is getting better - maybe you want that to be true, but my opinion is just that he's more motivated and fitter, and therefore is running more. And if you're running more, you'll end up in better positions more often, but not necessarily be intelligent with your movement overall.

*If* he goes out on loan, the destination of the loan will say a lot about his future at the club. If he goes to a club like, say, West Ham, where the style of football is the antithesis of what we play but might suit Carroll's main strengths, then that strikes me as a loan with the intention of selling later. If he goes somewhere with more of a passing game (I'd include Fulham here), then it might be a case of allowing him to get regular game time without compromising Liverpool's results while they wait for Carroll to get up to speed.",0,1342373668,null,0,false,0,c5edbas,t3_wlkve,t1_c5edbas,t1_c5ed62h,null,1429382428,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

The former especially has lots of people well versed in how to deal with councils, council tax, bailiffs, etc.

For anyone reading this and being harassed by bailiffs: NEVER LET THEM IN. They have no legal power to force entry and seize your belongings. They can only take your things if you let them in.

Giving Sandro first team opportunity ahead of the best defensive midfielder of last season when he's not ready is only going to damage Sandro.

They told us the market moves quickly, so we might have to come back a few times. A lot of properties seem to be on the market for right now. The places that are to be let out for september always are student rooms. I guess that the fact that we are searching for september is both an advantage (lots of properties on the market) and a disadvantage (quick moving market).

Water costs a lot more than in Belgium, but electricity seems to be a lot cheaper, so that kind of evens out. But it's good to know, since we now know in what tier we have to look. 

We have been using streetview to get an idea how far away supermarkets are from a certain property. I already thought this wouldn't be a big problem, since everyone has to buy groceries somewhere...

Nor do I, but then I don't know many racists who would refer to all blacks as n****** or many sexists who would refer to all women as b******* or homophobes who would refer to all gays as q*****.  In fact, each group will always play games about the worthy ones and the less worthy ones.

As a layman, you are liable for council tax on a house irrespective of whether you live in it or not (if your house is empty you still need to pay it, for example) - so you *can* be liable for council tax on more than one house.  However if someone else is living there and you're not, then they should be liable.  She should be able to tell a court that she's not living there.  Bailiffs shouldn't just turn up and demand money on the spot, they should go through an official process - [This](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/debt_e/debt_action_your_creditor_can_take_e/debt_bailiffs_e/about_bailiffs.htm) suggests that they should contact your sister 14 days in advance, so if they did this without that official documents then she might have an official complaint to make.

Well, I think we can assume that Newcastle has made the offer. The Guardian and BBC are reporting that as fact, not speculation, and those two sources always acknowledge a rumour. Also, Rodgers has admitted he would consider a loan offer for the player. I don't think this is just idle chatter.

It wouldn't be the first time this has happened. Mancini loaned out half of City's strikers when he came in. The fact that Rodgers didn't dismiss the question of a Carroll loan out of hand shows that he has at least considered it.

The fact is, if Brendan has made the decision that he won't fit in his system, and I'm not positive he will, we will never recover any of his lost value sitting him on the bench.

In &gt;fact, each group will always play games about the worthy ones and &gt;the less worthy ones.

wait, hold on. its not quite like that (aside from the bitches example). you refer to derogatory terms for the whole of certain races and sexualities but ""chav"" started being used as an insult for one part of society that has nothing to do with creed, colour or sexuality or social status. 

The fact that the term is being used as a derogatory term against working class/poor people is because it is known by all to be insulting because of the association with what everyone agrees is chav like behaviour (i.e. bad behaviour). As an insult it could be used against anyone (The last time I personally used it to describe a man who spat on my car at some traffic lights. was he working class? who knows!). I could have used more descriptive words as an insult but chav has become the catch-all for this type of behaviour.

there is nothing wrong with being gay/straight/asexual/black/white/asian etc etc and therefor derogatory terms to describe those people is wrong.

 But I think we can all agree that the kind of antisocial behavoir that takes place for someone to be labelled a chav is not acceptable. it is a **lifestyle** not what you were born as. you don't have to spit on my car. you don't have to shit in Argos. 

I saw a book in Waterstones the other day titled ""Chav: the demonisation of the working class"" It annoyed me because of the authors inference that the word is being used against the working class instead of what many use it for which is to demonise a lifestyle and behaviour that is, to society at large,  anti-social.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I do tend to call people wankers but hypothetically in another 10/20 years who's to say that wankers becomes a derogatory term for another stereotype.

I think we're fairly safe, since 99.9% of us do it, and the other .1% are liars.  Wanker is a purely ""how you say"" word, since it could basically apply to anyone in matter of fact, but it means something bad only when it's read or inflected that way.

&gt;The word gay originally meant happy, went to meaning homosexual and then also known as lame. Words change their meanings

This is true, words do change their meanings.  Although gay was initially used mostly as a non-offensive alternative to queer and a less formal alternative to homosexual.  Only latterly has a new usage - lame or naff or something - sprung from it, and I'm a bit old to have a view on that.  But I think today's gay people are generally in a much better position to know and defend their turf on that one, so I'll defer to them.  I don't particularly like the use of gay to mean crappy, but it might be perceived as not connected by gay people, so I'm not going to get strident about it unless and until I know it's seriously viewed as an issue.",0,1342383542,null,0,false,0,c5effw2,t3_wlbsv,t1_c5effw2,t1_c5eeknu,null,1429383429,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

* [section 4 of the public order act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_or_provocation_of_violence)

The key point is probably whether there was a credible threat of violence. I'm guessing (but am no expert) - threatening to take property is not violence in itself, but a threat to force entry (given that you have a right to protect your property) might be a sufficient implication of violent intent.

If you think that's likely, see if any neighbours saw what happened and get them to write down what they saw now, while they still remember it clearly. Better - report it to the police and ask them to interview witnesses.

Don't try to coach anyone in what to say, obviously - there's ways the police can figure that out, and that definitely *is* a criminal offence (perjury IIRC).

Important - check what address they sent any summons to.

I know people who, in the past, have found that they were basically taken to court without their knowledge because some council had (knowingly) used wrong addresses leading up to the court, then suddenly started using the correct address as soon as they'd got the decision they wanted ""in absentia"" or whatever it's called.

If the council are intentionally lying to the courts about someones address (which I assume is all part of the paperwork) with the intent of denying them the chance to defend themselves in court, presumably that is Contempt of Court, which is a criminal offence.

In all the European countries I know (Spain, France, Germany and Italy) beer is much cheaper in shops than in bars. The only other place I've been apart from the UK where the price difference between drinking at home and drinking in bars is so small was Turkey.

Don't get me wrong, I love pubs and I'm not arguing either way with regards to which should be more expensive. I just find it very strange that conventional wisdom in the UK appears to run so contrary to other places I've been. I also find it hard to believe that supermarkets are such a large threat to pubs in the UK when in Spain, for instance, bars do just fine at around 3€ a pint when you can easily buy beer in supermarkets for less than 0.50 euros a pint.

That said, however, all this about alcohol companies being to blame for dangerous drinking is utter bullshit. If cheap alcohol caused binge drinking, Spain would be in a fucking coma.

If someone is overly aggressive and noisy refusing the bailiffs entry, I guess that might just backfire so that the police could justify taking the argument inside to mitigate the public disturbance, but that's highly dubious - the easiest way to mitigate the disturbance is for them to leave, but ""she was refusing entry and that caused a disturbance, so that justified us entering her property"" seems too absurd to work in court even when the police are saying it.

Other than that... if the bailiffs *do* force entry, the police would probably have the right to enter. But only in order to arrest those bailiffs for breaking and entering.

For me, however, one of the areas that he needs to work on is his movement after he plays these forward passes. While a 30-40 yard pass is hard to catch up to, especially as a big man, I found that his lack of surging runs after these passes leads to the wingers (who I mostly see on the receiving end of these passes) lacking a target in the box. As I see it, his forward passing opens up the wings as to allow the likes of Downing to get a cross in, but his lack of movement back into a target position almost nullifies what good it made.

Perhaps there are reasons beyond my scope that explain the lack of post-pass runs. There may be some conformation bias built in there also, as I started to notice this early on in last season. If I am correct, however, this is definitely an area he needs to work on.

3 ""Wingers"" - Cole, Downing, Bellamy

5 Undefined Mids- Gerrard, Hendo, Aqua, Adam, Jonjo

3 talented youngsters - Suso, Pacheco, Sterling

To me, we are SO far from where we want to be....for some supporters to be saying to get rid of Carroll is preposterous. We need all the players and the talent we can manage! An additional signing or two, paired with some new philosophy at the club will hopefully make for a better season.

&gt;someone being considered a chav has nothing (if anything) to do with their class, and to link the two seems worse than what you are upset about.

Are you telling me - seriously - you don't see any relationship at all between the label ""chav"" and class, because I find that quite inconceivable?

&gt;The people comparing it to racial or homophobic slurs need to think about what they're saying for a moment. I've been called nearly every homophobic slur under the sun for something I have no control over and to compare the hatred behind those words and this? It leaves a poor taste in my mouth.

I take your point, I'm sorry if I offended you, that wasn't my intent.  The struggle for gay rights has been a long and bitter one, with plenty of bile and blood spilt on the way.  And yes, totally concede it's far from over yet, though it's better than it was in some parts of the world (including the UK).

true,MtHammer,smith,Smith,"You should probably start with the 1st season after the show was brought back in 2005.  As SpeaksDwarren has pointed out, the ""new"" seasons are all on Netflix Instant.

That said, the first season can be a little tough to get into.  I gave up on trying to get into Doctor Who twice before I finally powered through the first 5 or so episodes.  I'm glad I did, though, as it's now one of my very favorite shows of all time.

If you're really having trouble, you might want to try one of the better stand-alone episodes from later on for proof of what the show is capable of being once it gets firing on all cylanders.  For that I'd recommend either season 3's *Blink* or season 2's *The Girl in the Fireplace*.

That said, if you place a higher priority on catching up to where the show is currently, you might want to consider starting with season 5.  It's the beginning of a new show-runner/head writer, a new Doctor, a new sidekick, and even a new composition of the main theme song.  As a result, season 5 can serve as a perfectly good alternate entry point to the series and would make it much easier to catch up and start watching new episodes with the rest of us once the show resumes in a little more than a month or so.  As a personal aside, the current Doctor, Matt Smith, takes over starting in season 5 and is probably my favorite.

I'd say those are your best options.  I'd wait until you've gone through the entirety of the new seasons before diving into the original backlog of episodes from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  You'll have a much easier time that way.

true,demiquaver,null,null,"Yes. From one Londoner living on an Olympic route, there are a number of reasons to loathe the Olympics, even discounting the vast, vast sums paid out on the blasted thing in the midst of a double-recession.

1. The entire event is out of sync with current British sentiment and situation. We are no longer 'on top', we are no longer flush with cash, we are no longer Blair's bitch and subject to the special relationship's command to hop-to and get to war. The bid went in seven years ago, under a different government and with an entirely different interpretation of what the landscape would be like. 

2. The focus drives everything toward London, London, London. Apart from the torch relay (in the driving rain, no less) investment in the capital is not doing too badly compared to areas around the country that are absolutely starving for some kind of capital investment. It causes resentment, even if things weren't so bad in 2005. 

3. And even if the focus is London, the organization of how to deal with it if you don't want anything to do with the events is practically non-existent. The Tube system that can barely cope and is absolutely choked at rush-hour, is about to get same-again. The threat of strikes loom, and a practice run the other week with seeing the Tubes at 'over-capacity' basically shut down the work commute. 

I think this is really the solid part of my irritation and resentment with the blasted affair. I do not care if you wish to run, jump, hop or skip in the name of your country, it's absolutely fine. But I can do my job a great deal better actually *at work* and the government telling me blithely that 'don't go in to work' is the solution to their mess shoves the problem on to me and to my employer. Strangely enough, I don't want to be at my desk by six am, or stay there until nine o'clock at night in order to allow the tubes to get back to breathing room. I'd like to work the standard hours I was hired to, and be able to get back and forth because the money I earn from doing so, oddly enough, is pumped back into the system in no small way. 

4. Because it's not really an Olympics for anyone but the sponsors. And not only does attendance at events cost vast amounts of money no one normal has at their disposal right now, the Olympics shuts down every public space in London. St James Park is a clusterfuck right now, Earl's Court (i.e. major transition station and expo centre) is gone til the middle of September. I'm a derby-girl; not being able to watch/officiate derby pisses me the fuck off, especially when they're not permitting the sport Olympic credentials.

true,[deleted],null,null,"- Southern Med types sometimes (girls) seem to think that a wedding is a time to get outlandishly dressed, not in bad taste but more flamboyant, - go with posh subtle.  If you're a man: smart suit, polished shoes, and you should be fine.  Let the bride and the bridegroom, the bestman/ushers/bridesmaids bring the auspicious swag. You're the suave, sophisticated James Bond type (normal suit - no dinner jacket, this isn't the Titanic).  What you do you do well, but understated.  Shoes shined, double cuffs if you can carry the cufflinks, sharply pressed  collar.  Understated tie.  Girls go a little bit more - still understated, but matching outfit, and it's a great excuse for them to buy a hat, which they nearly all do. 

- Ceremony depends on the person.  Generally you're talking a church/registry office affair.  Not a bit unlike going to any church.  Generally it's an organised meal  afterwards - sometimes not open to all guests.  And then generally there's a less official evening reception-party (you might want to check politely if it's church or reception that you're invited to.)

- It's customary to buy a present but not money.  Sometimes the couple will provide a list of things they'd like to have and then people before the event pick one and tell a relative or an organiser that that's what they're bringing without there being repeats.  It's not always the case and in my opinion it kinda robs the point of giving a present.  Be original - doesn't have to be expensive.

&gt;Any possible cultural mistakes I should know of beforehand?

Only one strange one that I can think of.  It's customary to gently slap the bride's mother on the bottom AFTER THE CEREMONY.

We dont need him and I doubt any other club will be interested. He cannnot play with the physical presence in England and high tempo games tire him out. That is why very average players look slightly better in Italy when they are awful. Anyway Henderson is a much better CM than Aquilani because he tackles and tries for headers. The only reason he played bad in some games was the fact that he is not a RM. Look at Milner, playing a CM on the wing is a horrible mistake, they aren't fast enough or skillful enough to beat the full backs. I still don't know why you hold him in such high regard, when was the last time you watched him in a competitive game? I can guarantee he played shite. Friendlies are low intensity games for natch fitness purposes. The team have no need to be motivated and fight to the death as all you do is risk injuries. It is common knowledge Aquilani only tried to interest other teams and to think he cared about the club is deluded.

Typically at the reception or after the meal there'll be a dance floor and traditionally the bride and groom have the first dance.   They take to the floor, awkwardly waltz for a couple of minutes, and then they'll open it up to everybody.  Sometimes the bride's father steps in and dances with his daughter, and generally it'll be the aunts and uncles and immediate friends of the family that first jump up after the formalities because nobody wants to be first but they feel they have to. If you've been introduced to the particular family, and if there's a small daughter/niece that's been brought along and she's playing wallflower when people are taking to the dancefloor, do the gentlemanly thing and ask her at the start if she'd like to dance.  It's not weird if you've previously been introduced, it's a family function, and you won't be stuck with them for the rest of the night; but the bride more likely than not will have a few unattached friends whose wombs you'll make jump.

true,Shepy,cnty-uk,Geordieland,"I'm a wedding photographer, so have been to a fair few as you can imagine. All weddings are different, but giving you a general guide would be:

Ceremony - usually from about 20 minutes to an hour, depending (civil, religious etc) - Venue name will usually give you a clue on this. Registry office is at the lower end of things, wedding venue in the middle, church at the longer end.

Usually an hour or two milling about and socialising, then you have the 'wedding breakfast' or meal. This is usually either started or ended with the speeches from the wedding party (speech/meal or meal/speech  order is arbitrary).  Meal and speeches usually take about two hours.

Another hour or two gap, then the ""reception"" or evening celebrations, usually to include more people that could not be accommodated during the day / full ceremony.  This would usually include the cutting of the cake and the first dance as the married couple and continues well into the night with people getting drunk and often more food or a buffet served midway through the evening.

A few pointers for you.

Gift - A general guideline for the gift is that if you're invited to the daytime / full event, then the price of your gift should approximately equal or exceed the price of the meal they will be buying for you, which is generally in the region of £50 to £75 per head. Obviously if you're an evening only guest, this can be lower.  Most couples will provide a gift list or have registered somewhere, and you can buy from this (and money pools / collections are becoming more common too). Usually this would be stated on the invite.  Your invite should tell you if you're invited to the whole event or the evening reception, though if it doesn't then a good guideline is if the timings start from noon / mid afternoon you're invited to the full event, the evening receptions generally start from 7pm ish.

Hotel - A lot of couples will pre-book a number of rooms at the venue, and often at a lower rate than if you book yourself, so chat with the bride/groom to find out about this and if you can save a bit there. (Helps them too as they often have obligations of how many rooms to fill)

Dress - If you're female, then it's considered extremely rude to wear a white dress, this should be for the bride only. Traditionally it was also considered bad form to be dressed in the same colour as the bridesmaids, though this is often not adhered to any more, but you could check if there is a wedding colour and avoid if you like. If you're a guy then a suit or shirt and tie.

Normally hats are off in Church but I think the new 'facınators' are Ok.

After the main cremony the bride and groom leave in a seperate car to go and get their 'just married' photos and the lıke whilst the guests go to the venue for the reception.

The wedding breakfast (whıch ıs referred to as a breakfast no matter what tıme) is normally a sit down meal. During which 3 speaches are made:

Father of the brıde:  Says how great hıs daughter is
Groom: Says how great his wife is
Best Man: Pokes fun at how terrible a person the Groom is.

Theres a toast after each speach - a sıp of whatever you have ıs fıne. After the meal the Brıde and Groom cut the cake (normally both holdıng the knife) and ocasıonally the fırst slıce ıs sometımes saved for the Couple to enjoy for the Chrıstening of theır first chıld and sometimes crammed into the grooms face by the bride.
