Just. 

The point is that the best time:payoff ratio when it comes to losing weight is simply not eating as much. Not eating as much actually SAVES you time whereas exercising for 40 minutes a day is 40 minutes of your day lost and probably about 150-200 calories burned. 

As far as weight loss (not fitness) is concerned, simply not eating 2/3rds of that mars bar at lunch will have the same effect as that 40 minutes of jogging.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; These studies have been replicated time and again. Are your concerns related to this study or all similar studies? 

The same flaw is apparent in all of them. What is also definitely happening is sales of music is falling, but usage increasing. So do the maths.

&gt; I'm sure you know better than to compare piracy with theft, one removes the original the other does not.

Ha ha the 'use of the theft word' argument is a tedious semantic distraction. We are talking about IP not physical objects - the fact that taking them leaves the original is irrelevant - the concepts are now a little more complex and the 'thing' that is being deprived is revenue both potential and real. If you really don't want to use the word theft then fine, but actually yes, piracy does fall under the definition in many dictionaries (which do not require deprivation). Either way it is a pointless debate. 

&gt; lots of legitimate artists use torrenting to promote their music too

Good i would fully support their wishes, given that is what they want to do with their own property. Obviously the vast majority of artists (or producers, technicians, session musicians) do not feel the same way.

&gt; You say users couldn't control the output on radio or TV, but i'm sure you're aware of home VHS recorders or even sky plus now, and I don't know anyone over 30 who didn't record songs off the radio at one point or another so I don't think that point stands either

There is a huge practical difference between recording stuff off the radio and TV and playing content you own. Yes everybody has done it (me included) - but it is cumbersome enough that it clearly does not substitute for the convenience of having the material for real. An assertion supported by the fact that home recording technology in the 70s, 80s &amp; 90s did not have a negative impact on record sales. So from an artists point of view TV &amp; radio (and probably now Youtube) are a healthy balance between promotion and preserving their desire to be compensated for their work. 

&gt; I've demonstrated pirates buy more music and film than others so I don't know why you're claiming that there is no end final sale from it.

No you haven't? Learn some statistics - all that has been demonstrated is a correlation between the two - which is likely explained by demographic factors. The overall effect on the macro scale is in stark contrast to ""theory"" that piracy promotes sales. If piracy caused more sales, then sales would be going up in line with piracy. They are not. 

&gt; TV and Radio pay pretty tiny royalties and almost none of it reaches the artists

Any other attacking option would be good, whether its Hoilett, Belhanda, Gaston Ramirez, Boudabouz, Krasic, Rasmus Elm or Sigurdsson.

I prefer Gaston Ramirez because not only is he a Uruguayan hot prospect, he's also got 8 goals and 5 assists in the notoriously defensive Italian league.

Bench would be: Doni, Kelly, Coates, Shelvey, New signing, Sterling/Suso.

Music sales are falling, but concert revenue is at an all time high and so are cinema ticket sales. What maths should I be doing. If we're talking causality then i'm going to need more than just pointing at piracy as the problem, if indeed it is a problem. Markets changes, business models change, before tyhe 1920s no artist alive had ever made money from selling records, where they did exist it was for promotion. What was a business model in 1990 may not work anymore which is what we're seeing with pop albums, nobody is willing to pay £14 for three good tracks and ten fillers any more. Especially when record companies try to sell albums for the same price digitally despite having substantially lower costs. 

Let's just past the supposedly pointless debate then. The adverts about piracy is theft and stealing a car nark me is all. Did you know they pirated the music for those adverts too? Did you also know record labels can include songs from almost any artist on a compilation cd and just put them on some pseudo list to be paid in the future? 

You say obviously the vast majority of producers don't feel that way, any evidence. We had Jay-Z, Black Eyed Peas and Kanye in an advert supporting megaupload for example. And on the other end of the scale tpb have been promoting free music by selected artists who are happy to give their music away for free. I give all of my music away too. The industry has changed, we now have perfect distribution through the internet and approaching perfect competition through how cheaply people can record at home now, essentially, we no longer read the record companies, at least not in the way they have previously worked.  

Really? When I recorded stuff off the TV or radio I can't recall on many occasions needing to upgrade. I don't understand in what way pressing record on a machine is cumbersome, especially when they can be pre-programmed. Maybe your assertion demonstrates that piracy doesn't actually affect sales? So youtube is fine? They don't pay royalties.

The entertainment industry are ultimately bullying dinosaurs who don't understand how to properly market their products as they won't give up their dying business model. Game of Thrones could have made ridiculous amount of money but they restrict its availability through certain medium, timescales and regions as is well demonstrated here - http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones

If people can't access something legally, they will most likely find an illegal version, it's not much different from drugs. Netflix, itune to an extent show how it should be done but the industry will kill itself before it realises and well fuck em anyway, they've done more to damage and sully good music than anyone so i can't say I have much sympathy. 

As for IP, well, balls to that as well really. So much of it is bollocks and totally counterproductive to society. IP for computer programming for example, how can people claim ownership over characters in a particular order, or musical notes or words in a particular order for 80 plus years. 5 years tops.

Then there's the blue-sticker ones, usually made out of stuff like glass/carbon/kevlar fibre that are also usually carry a FIM approved sticker and will keep your brain inside in a serious accident (I've seen a sales rep drive a landrover over an Arai helmet shell with no damage). 

The cheap-ass helmets we'd have on sale were green-stickered.  Probably enough to stop stuff falling out when riding a 50cc scooter at 30mph and that it.  But since they were stickered/approved it was legal to sell 'em.

For everything else like jackets, boots and gloves there's no approval needed so you could in theory make a race suit out of tissue paper and sell it legally.  There's a reason a decent racesuit can cost over £1500; tripple stitching, hand picked and grained leather, integrated body armour, not falling apart when they get wet.

I'll state that I and everyone else fucking hated selling the cheap lids to people.

You mean the Barcelona team that finished 3rd? I reckon you're a better manager than Frank Rijkaard, then?


&gt;Porto with Mourinho where an amazing squad, players such as Deco, Carvalho, Maniche, Portugals golden era, can you say there a similar set up at Liverpool, we have 4 very good players in Reina, Agger, Gerrard, and Saurez

So you named 3 players from Porto and called it Portugal's golden era, and named 4 players from Liverpool but say it isn't comparable. Firstly, Mourinho took over a Porto that had finished 3rd the previous year. This was a squad that already had Vitor Baia, Carvalho, Deco and Costinha. Maniche, Nuno Valente and Paulo Ferreira were all signed by him. Maniche, in particular, was out of contract at Benfica. You know you're comparing a Porto squad **post-Mourinho** with a Liverpool squad **pre-Rodgers**, right?

&gt;how do you know any of them will want to play under Rodgers, I wouldn't want to after playing under a legend like Dalglish

That's why you're not a professional footballer and they are. If they don't want to play under Rodgers, they'll submit a transfer request. What you are doing here, is making a ridiculous assumption that puts into question the integrity and professionalism of these players. Have you any hint or clue that these players do not want to play under Rodgers? 

By the way, no one questions Dalglish's status as legend, but it was hardly as a manager. Yes, he won 3 titles as manager with us, but even our fans then knew that he wasn't the most astute tactically. What Kenny did was take the system which was created by Shankly and perfected by Paisley and run it the same way, carrying it with his force of personality and charisma. I doubt any of our players were particularly amazed by Dalglish's tactical ability during training. 

&gt;Ferguson took over United and was nearly sacked at the start for being so bad, do you think Rodgers will get that comfort? no, its champs league or bust. 

Ferguson took 7 years before winning anything. Maybe Rodgers will only get 1 year, maybe he'll get more than that. Who knows? Do you? 

&gt;and so you named 5 over 20 years or so, its not hard to name that many risks that flopped over the last few seasons, especially at the big clubs, you only have to look at AVB one of your success, who is now seen as a massive flop a year later.

I'll address the AVB part of your sentence first. AVB went to England following his undefeated season at Porto. Other than the fact that Mourinho had spent an extra season at Porto and won the Champions League, he arrived on a similar situation as Mourinho, hired because of his achievements with Porto. He failed. However, he did succeed at Porto despite having limited managerial experience. So he was a massive success at Porto, but a massive flop at Chelsea. Doesn't it balance out? Or does it, in fact, show that hiring a manager based on past successes has limited correlation with success? 

You say that I named 5 over the last 20 years, and that its not hard to name many risks that flopped at the big clubs. Since the risks in question are managers who are young and relatively inexperienced, I'd really like to see your lists of risks who flopped. Out of the 6 managers who have won the Premier League, only 2 of them were first hired based on previous big time success. Ferguson was experienced with Aberdeen, but took 7 years to win a trophy at United. Wenger was considered a huge risk, a manager who was seen to have been ran to Japan in ""disgrace"" after a disappointing season with Monaco. Dalglish, we just sacked. Mourinho was hired on the back of 2 seasons with Porto and a total of less than 4 seasons of managerial experience. Even though AVB failed with Chelsea, it doesn't deny the fact that Porto has succeeded in taking risks with 3 young and untried managers (includes the current manager Vitor Perreira). Only Carlo Ancelotti and Roberto Mancini were hired for their experience. 

Out of the current league champions in Europe, the manager with the most experience is Rene Girard of Montpellier, followed by Mancini. The other championship winning managers are: Jurgen Klopp, whose only previous managerial experience was with Mainz, who were relegated, Frank de Boer, who had no prior experience as manager but won the Eredivisie two years in a row, Antonio Conte, who had a poor experience managing Arezzo, Bari and Atalanta, with promoting Siena to Serie A his only accomplishment before joining Juventus. 

So let's see. The managers of the winning clubs in Germany, Italy, Holland and Portugal were all relative young, with limited previous success when they were hired for the job. The manager of the champions of Spain got his first big break at Porto despite limited experience. The manager of second-placed Barcelona was promoted from being the coach of the reserve team, and had zero senior managerial experience. The manager of Premier League champions had gotten his first manager job despite not having completed his coaching badges, Serie A officials had to give special dispensation so Mancini could take the post. He was eventually hired by Inter Milan despite have only 3 prior years of experience. I would also like to add that Di Matteo, manager at European Champions Chelsea, has a resume that boasts of stints at MK Dons and WBA. 

So I have given you a very comprehensive but by no means exhaustive list of managers on whom a risk was taken and ended up paying dividends. Almost all of them have less than 10 years managerial experience total. They took over the reins of big clubs despite having no prior experience of managing a big club, and no outstanding CVs. Can you please provide a list of young, risky managerial choices who flopped? By the way, AVB wouldn't be counted as a risk since he had won the Portuguese league and also the UEFA cup before joining. You may still add him if you wish.

In the citadel, born and raised. Playing
with rontgen bricks is how I spent most of my days.
Studying and playing and staring at the universe.
But I soon learned this place was a curse.

So after a couple of years, I was up to no good.
Started stealing a tardis from my neighbourhood.
I took one little flight and I didn't look back.
Now I realize it was excitement that I lacked.

I changed a few times and when I reached five.
The timelords and the master wanted control of my life.  
If anything seeing them again was lame.
But I thought nah-forget-it lets play Rassilon's game.

I pulled up to a tomb with Doctor one two and three,

Looked at my planet and said ""No way....""

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"Players that are capable of playing central midfield: Essien, Romeu, Ramires, Lampard, Mikel, Meireles.

Noteworthy youth players capable of playing central midfield: McEachran, Chalobah. There's maybe one or two more in our youth setup (Lewis Baker, John Swift) but I'll leave them out for now.

So we're left with six first-team midfielders and two youth mids. I don't think either youth player is ready to jump into Chelsea's starting XI so for next season as it stands, we have six midfielders for two spots. One defensive, one in a more freely defined role.

Mikel and Romeu are first and second choice for defensive midfield, respectively. Essien would be third choice, and none of the other three are ideal candidates to play this position. Mikel and Romeu are fairly young, both under 25 and will likely see lots of time at defensive midfield. Barring transfers or major injuries, our defensive midfield position is pretty set for the future, lots of potential and experience already.

Before discussing the free midfield role, there's Ramires. Lots of question marks around him and it's difficult to make a proper assessment without really knowing where he'll play next season. He could return to right wing and battle it out with Hulk, or he could battle Lampard and Meireles for central midfield minutes. It'll likely come down to who our coach is and his assessment of the player. Personally I think he should stay at right wing because we have so few right footed wingers and he's done an impeccable job out there last season.

Now, we have Lampard first choice to partner the CDM, Meireles second choice (assuming Ramires is at right wing) and Essien once again third choice. It would be highly unlikely (and not recommended) to play Mikel and Romeu beside each other. Lampard had a great revival last season under Di Matteo, but Essien was a shell of the former Bison we know him as, and Meireles had flashes of good play, but overall, very inconsistent. Essentially we're left with one top midfielder in Lampard who will surely need someone to share the majority of games with - he's already injured before the season has started. 

Can we depend on Essien? Sentimentally I'd like to think so, but he's faced numerous serious knee injuries and it's a real possibility that his time as a top player at a top club is over. I view Meireles as a squad player and nothing more. If Lampard goes down, either we depend on Ramires (viable alternative although if Hulk is hurt at the same time, we're in a real tough spot) or we settle on a mediocre alternative in Essien or Meireles.

I think we could bring in another midfielder and not sacrifice the development of our younger players and add quality and depth to a very important and influential position. Is Modric the player to add? I'm not so sure, what I liked best about the Mourinho era of midfielders was how tough they were. Modric is definitely a good player, great playmaker but defensively suspect and very small. Would playing Mata at CAM and Modric at CM leave us too frail and defensively weak? I think so. I think maybe we should switch our attention to a midfielder who's tougher but still able to be defensively and offensively influential. Fellaini fits. Tiote is a very strong and tough player that I'd like to have. I'm hearing good things about Yann M'Vila although he might be more suited to a pure CDM role.

**tl;dr**: Yes new CM, maybe not Modric though.",0,1338485093,null,0,false,0,c4ul7cr,t3_udl5o,t1_c4ul7cr,t1_c4ugqsr,null,1429038989,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

The downside of that attitude is that he might try things when they're not on - and I think most of us were frustrated by that at least a few times. He had the [lowest pass completion rate](http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/26/) of any of our midfielders this season, by a few % as well. Sure, he got six assists, but with ball retention such a big focus in Rodgers' system and a lot more assists coming from the wide players in the front 3, I can't see Adam adapting his game - he's only ever played this way.

&gt; His major problem is that he's just slow

Which is a big problem in a system where the whole team has to press off the ball.

I was in Wills Hall, came from a comprehensive. As a rule the whole university is populated by some rah's, toff's, other derogtarory stereotypes etc. You'll find more extreme concetrations of these people in Wills, but it is not restricted to there.

Despite that whilst in Will's I knew loads of 'normal' folks. People with posh accents who were great, people who sounded common as muck but tried their hardest to run with the eton-esque crowd. You'll find great/horrible people irregardless imho.

Personally, if I made my choice again I would have chosen hiatt baker or UH (University Hall). Hiatt Baker is catered and seems to have a really good social scene. UH is self-catered, cheap and cheerful. People here are probably the most chilled out with regards to social standing.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"Just recently, there has been a few discussions on the radio and a tv program about British schools that highlighted and interesting issue..

Children who are placed in private school (the like that the wealthy can afford) often run the schools curriculum in a way that is heavily influenced by the entry requirements of the big elite university's. The criticism was that students are educated to meet specific requirements that would give them an advantage into getting accepted into an Oxford, or a Cambridge Uni at the expense of a more rounded education. In effect they are training kids to get to university above all else.

Private schools also (apparently) run more additional outside school hour activates, things like learning music, playing sports that public schools simply cannot complete with.

On the opposite end, the public schools, are said to give there students a more rounded education, which is far less targeted. This ultimately gave them less of a chance at getting into Oxford, but gave them a more balanced and rounded education, which prepared them more for the outside world.

so, yes...there is an element of truth to the idea that if you are lucky enough to be born into money, it can have its advantages - it can help you to Oxford, which I turn opens many many doors.

Granted, there are versions of turbines in the R&amp;D stage that don't have this flaw, but they're a while off.

Moving away from non-renewable energy? There is no solution at the moment that makes sense for the UK. To me, that doesn't mean idealistically pick the best of a bad bunch and run with it - instead either develop a technology that allows us to effectively move away from nonrenewables (wind does not contain the power for that), or use nonrenewables.

The thing is, most of the arguments against wind power, I find, are either blown out of proportion or simply outdated. Wind farms, 20 years ago, were not a viable solution to the impending energy crisis. However, there has been so much more research and advances in technology since then and Wind Power is quickly becoming more and more efficient.  
When used in conjunction with other forms of renewable energy, such as solar or wave power, this combination with a few more technological advancements at hand could quite easily meet our energy needs without the assistance of nuclear power or fossil fuels. All wind power needs is a chance.  
Also, regarding the whim of the wind, there are many parts of the UK where there is always wind. Big open fields and hills, such as many areas in Scotland (or out at sea) are ideal places to put wind farms. As long as the powers that be who are in charge of passing wind farm applications wisely site the turbines, I don't see this as a particular issue.  
  The visual impact, in my humble opinion, shouldn't even come into debate when passing planning applications for wind farms. It's such a superficial argument and entirely dependent on subjective opinion (which only a few people share, from my experience of this debate).",0,1338494441,null,0,false,0,c4univv,t3_uds3u,t1_c4univv,t1_c4un26f,null,1429040244,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; and Wind Power is quickly becoming more and more efficient

I should hope so - technology seldom stands still. But this is too qualitative, as far as I'm aware the power output from a wind turbine is still tiny.

I don't see why it needs to be used in conjunction with other forms of renewable energy. Either wind can solve the energy crisis, solar can, or wave can. Because essentially when saying ""in conjunction"" you're summing the power output of all three together, and power usage is an exponential function with respect to time. So all you need is one source of power with an exponential output with respect to time. Whether that's wave, solar or wind or a combination of the three is irrelevant as that's just modifying the leading constant.

(Apologies if the above didn't make sense, it's late and I'm having difficulty explaining big-O notation and domination of terms).

Note also that the current design cannot be put in the most high wind areas as they cannot withstand the winds - they need to be shut off a lot of the time else they'd turn too fast and set alight.

Besides that, when Doctor Who began to be aired here in the states, Tom Baker was the current Doctor, so that's what various PBS affiliates got.  That's the first Doctor a lot of PBS viewers in the early '80s saw.  

Also, Tom Baker's portrayal of the Doctor was just better suited to the typical idea of an American audience.  Baker was the more physical action-oriented Doctor.  (Ian Marter, who played Harry Sullivan, was an early companion for Four, and was added to be the character who would be more physical and do more stunts, but when Baker proved more than capable, Harry was written out)  Baker's entire style proved to be more appealing to a typical American audience than other Doctors.

Because of that, his episodes were shown in repeats far more often than other Doctors, meaning he got more exposure on PBS affiliates than other Doctors.  As such, he's the more memorable.

Or, what if the leader themself isn't dead, but incapacitated? Maybe they've gone insane. Maybe they're possessed.

It would be better if everybody was responsible for their own beam up and security wrist bands. Obviously the head computer would give them the codes and such, but each member should be able to manage their own bands as I can manage my own computer.

Torres needs to be up top by himself. We saw what happened all last season when he was pushed wide by Drogba. And in comparison, look at his latest game for Spain, where he played 57 minutes alone at the top and had a great game. 

Mata can't play on the wing. We need him in the hole to communicate with Torres. It works, and it works well. Hazard goes on the left, and Hulk/Ramires on the right. 

As much as it pains me to say, Lampard is getting old. He needs to shift to more of a DM role, and be replaced by Essien every once in a while. He would play on the left, and Mikel/Meireles on the right. 

On defence, we need Cole on the left, with Bertrand stepping up to be a sub for him. Terry/Cahill as LCB and Cahill/Luiz as RCB. Ivanovic will have to play out on the right, but we need someone to replace him now that Bosingwa's gone. I've been recommending Gregory Van der Wiel from Ajax.
