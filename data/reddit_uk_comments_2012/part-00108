Ignoring the fact that you don't have a shred of evidence to back up your claim, the theory just doesn't make sense. 

Firstly, the risk is *nowhere* near the reward. Wikileaks is already a global story, if it was discovered that the Americans *paid a Swedish citizens to file rape allegations* to smear the Wikileaks founder's name, the situation would become considerably worse. The US would lose political clout on the world stage and numerous politicans would risk their jobs, welfare and safety.

Secondly, do you realise how hard that is? To pay two women a (presumably) considerable amount of money without *anyone* noticing? 

Thirdly, why would the Americans approach two very liberal, wikileak sympathisers to make the false accusations? They immediately risked the two women leaking the American's plans to the press.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"When he regenerates, his physical appearance can turn out to have him look just about any age. As for his actual age, well, he doesn't know how old he is. When the show went on hiatus, and during the 1996 movie, he was supposed to be around 900. If you notice, I believe, the 9th Doctor makes mention of also being 900 years old. This isn't because no time has past, but more likely that The Doctor has started counting over after losing track of time.

This is also supported in a book featuring the 8th Doctor, Vampire Science, in which The Doctor says he's somewhere around 1,000 years old, but lost track and started over with his last regeneration, putting himself at 3 years old. It's also very obvious that RTD, the show runner for 9/10, has read this book as he makes references to it, including naming The Doctor 'The Oncoming Storm', which is a direct reference to the book.

So long story short, his body does physically age(Which helps explain why The Doctor appears to age as individual actors grow older), but when he regenerates his body can come out looking just about any age, and isn't necessarily limited.

true,BeFuckingPolite,null,null,"Apologies, friend, but you're doing exactly the same thing you accuse the person above of doing.

Neither of you has any information past what is publicly available, so you're both basing your arguments on speculation. So first off, your pretense of protecting fair journalism is false. Nothing you said actually addressed journalism. You addressed the likelihood of the accusation (meaning it's just speculation in the opposite direction).

Any accusation that the US government did so and so in this case is obviously without evidence, but not without merit, because pretending these are outlandish accusations, as you are, implies you're not aware of the long history of the US government or other actors doing things **just like that**.

Example, without examining any evidence, it probably sounds completely absurd on its face to accuse the US government of orchestrating 9/11 ... but it only sounds absurd if you didn't know it was a fact that in the 1960s the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff put forward a plan to fake a terrorist attack on American citizens in order to justify a war against Cuba (fake attack meaning citizens would really die, just fake in the sense that they would blame Cuba). Operation Northwoods.

Now, that said, obviously when you do introduce evidence you see that 9/11 deniers are actually ridiculous conspiracy theorists who deny the facts in front of them.

The difference here is you have no facts. You just have your alternate version of speculation, and I'm sad to say that your ""The risk is too high, it doesn't make sense, they wouldn't do that"" does not match an accurate historical portrayal of the actions of the U.S. government.

**TL;DR - You're doing the same thing as the person above, and your comments have nothing to do with truth or journalism. Neither of you have evidence, so it's just reasoning with what's available, and until we see some real evidence about these specific aspects of the case then history implies the person above you is closer to the truth that you are.**",0,1345128275,null,0,false,0,c5u2ejo,t3_ybfpl,t1_c5u2ejo,t1_c5u1hpd,null,1429654432,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

2 players per position is great, but this isn't 2003 anymore and there are squad restrictions including homegrown rules that limit the bulk buying that Mourinho did. In any case Terry, Cahill, Luiz and Ivanovic is as solid depth for CB as you'll find in any team in europe probably. The resilience of our back 4 in the CL, despite sending offs and suspensions and injuries should show you that. 

Likewise we don't need as many strikers as Man u or Man city, since they play a 2 striker system, we only have place for 1. I think we'll have a Schurrle/Moses/Hulk kind of signing where the player primarily plays on the wing but can slot into CF role if injuries play a hand.

I know he gives it his all for us, and I respect that.  However, realistically, I don't think he's the sort of player that can be successful at Liverpool.  It's hard to say good things about someone when you feel that their performances consistently let the club and it's supporters down.  I know he tries his hardest, and I'm very thankful for that.

It was on the [Replica Prop Forum](http://www.therpf.com/f9/2010-custom-sonic-screwdriver-contest-vote-here-84045/) a few years back. You *might* have some luck asking around there, but the site is pretty fucking insular and circlejerk-y.

I've made three customs, mostly out of junk I've had lying around. There's really no rules when it comes to making a custom sonic, but I will say this: Plan out your electronics, not just how it looks. It's impossible to change the batteries in my first two without seriously damaging them, for example. That's not to say it's difficult to get them to light up, though. The biggest problems I've had and you might run into are putting a hole in the casing for the button/switch, and finding something good to use as the ""emitter"". I've had success with larger aquarium stones. You can use a white LED and a coloured stone, or a clear or mostly translucent stone with whatever colour LED you want to great effect. Also coloured, transparent Lego pieces are handy. 

As to sound effects, that usually takes up a lot of room. A possible solution can be found in recordable greeting cards, however. And if you can't get the device from the card to fit inside the sonic, you can simply hide it in your hand or your pocket.

Good luck. :)",0,1345132040,null,0,1345132289,0,c5u3fht,t3_w36v7,t1_c5u3fht,t3_w36v7,null,1429654871,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It doesn't help that virgin dishes out student deals at the beginning of term, the taxed network just gets taxed further which is why there is a slow down in speed, massive packet loss and horrible latency which is virgins biggest problem and mine as a gamer. It gets better over the year, probably due to people changing service or leaving uni etc etc.

http://www.come-racing.co.uk/downloads/GoBetGuide.pdf

My own personal strategy as a racegoer that has no real idea what is going on is as follows:

1) Don't bet more than you can afford  to lose. If you were to lose every single bet you put on but still feel that you have had a good day out then you are doing OK.

2) Go for each-way bets on a horse with moderate odds (around the 10/1 mark). An each-way bet is effectively two bets in one, so if you bet a £1 each way you are actually spending £2. £1 will pay out the full odds if the horse wins and the other £1 pays out a fraction of the odds if the horse is placed (1st, 2nd, 3rd and sometimes 4th if there are a lot of runners). Don't place an each way bet on the favourite because the payout if it comes 2nd or 3rd is generally not worth it.

3) Select your horse (I usually go for one with a funky name because I don't know any better).

4) I generally avoid the tote and go for the bookies. Look at the odds they are offering as there will be a variation so try to get the best odds for your chosen horse. With the tote, you don't know what odd you get until the start of the race.

5) If you win, take your ticket back to the bookie you bought it from and collect your winnings.",0,1345132356,null,0,false,0,c5u3irz,t3_ybo31,t1_c5u3irz,t3_ybo31,null,1429654891,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

That said, pro baseball in America has revenue sharing between teams, rules that leave young players under team control for nearly a decade of their professional careers before they can be free to move to another team, rules that limit spending(luxury tax if wages exceed a certain amount) and pant loads of other protections for ownership groups. 

Football is wide open, comparatively. No limits on salary, no limits on using personal wealth, few rules limiting buying and selling players other than a calendar, loaning of players, and loads of other stuff that give enormous advantage to ownership groups with seemingly bottomless wells of money. 

So yes, to expect the same sort of turnaround at LFC that FSG pulled with the Red Sox, which was already a top team in MLB in good financial shape, with LFC's finances in shambles, the wage bill far exceeding the talent on staff, and their place sliding down the table is ridiculous. FSG has a lot of money and LFC is a global brand, but they are not oil sheiks, literal royalty, or Russian gangstersimeanoligarchs with seemingly unlimited funding. 

That said, FSG are fantastic businessmen and sportsmen, but it will take time to learn the intricacies of competing on the worldwide football pitch. Give them patience and give them support, and they will give you a financially stable and growing club.

EDIT: From Wiki

""On 20 August 2010, two women came to Swedish police inquiring whether it was possible to require that Julian Assange be submitted to an HIV-test. The women involved were a 26-year-old in Enköping and a 31-year-old in Stockholm.[8] [9]
In answer to questions surrounding the incidents, the following day, Chief Prosecutor Eva Finné declared, ""I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape."" However, Karin Rosander, from the Swedish Prosecution Authority, said Assange remained suspected of molestation. Police gave no further comment at that time, but continued to investigate.[10]
After learning of the investigation, Assange said, ""The charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing.""[11]
On 30 August, he was questioned by the Stockholm police.[5][12] He denied the allegations, saying he had consensual sexual encounters with the two women.[11][13][14]
Claes Borgström, the attorney who represents the two women, appealed against the decision to drop part of the investigation""

""On 1 September 2010, Swedish Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny decided to resume the preliminary investigation concerning all of the original allegations. [16]
On 18 August 2010, Assange applied for a work and residence permit in Sweden.[17][18] On 18 October 2010, his request was denied.[18][17][19] He left Sweden on 27 September 2010[20]. The Swedish authorities have asserted that this is the same day that they notified Assange's lawyer of his imminent arrest[21].
On 18 November 2010, prosecutor Marianne Ny asked the local district court for a warrant for the arrest of Assange in order for him to be interviewed by the prosecutor.[22] As he was now living in England, the court ordered him detained (häktad) in absentia.[23][24] On appeal, the Svea Court of Appeal upheld the warrant on suspicion of rape, olaga tvång (duress/unlawful coercion), and two cases of sexuellt ofredande,[25][26][27][28] which has been variously translated as ""sexual molestation"",[29] ""sexual assault"",[30] ""sexual misconduct"", ""sexual annoyance"", ""sexual unfreedom"", ""sexual misdemeanour"", and ""sexual harassment"".[31][32][19][26][27] The Supreme Court of Sweden decided not to consider a further appeal as no principle was at stake.[citation needed][33] On 6 December 2010, Scotland Yard notified Assange that a valid European arrest warrant had been received.[34]
Assange has not yet been formally charged with any offence;[35] the prosecutor said that, in accordance with the Swedish legal system, formal charges will be laid only after extradition and a second round of questioning. The High Court found that the Swedish process has reached the stage of criminal proceedings, which would be equivalent to having been charged under English process[36].""

""According to published reports, the charges Sweden has lodged against Assange involve two different women. Their initial intention was reportedly to force Assange to take an HIV test. There are four charges: that on 14 August 2010 he committed ""unlawful coercion"" when he held complainant 1 down with his body weight in a sexual manner; that he ""sexually molested"" complainant 1 when he had condom-less sex with her after she insisted that he use one; that he had condom-less sex with complainant 2 on the morning of 17 August while she was asleep; and that he ""deliberately molested"" complainant 1 on 18 August 2010 by pressing his erect penis against her body.""",0,1345133233,null,0,1345133968,0,c5u3ru0,t3_ybfpl,t1_c5u3ru0,t1_c5u14iy,null,1429655009,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Yes, because the legal rule is that the European Arrest Warrant doesn't allow you to extradite someone who has been extradited to your country without the legal say so of the originating extradition country.

Concepts can be disproven through lack of evidence given the acceptance of a metaphysical framework. Accepting that ""something"" must either exist or not exist and the only was to ascertain it's existence is through empirical testing of it's phsyicality, God, Odin, the flying spagetti monster are all refutable though lack of evidence. I.e. All assumed to not exist until shown otherwise.

This is an important debate in the scientific method, positivism vs. falsification and all that. The above point is just a theory, one that adheres to positivism, you can't just state falsification as an objective truth.

So Obama is not a lizard, God does not exist, and this whole mess is not an inside job until proven otherwise.

&gt; And to me (again I apologize for the accusation, but you said you were in it for the truth) that you're saying these things that sound like you want the truth, but at the same time you're being intellectually dishonest about it.

And now you're being dishonest about the truth, claiming the ability to decide what knowledge is or isn't without any reference to other prominent theories. You may falsify, but I shall posit. There is no definitive answer.

While I agree that much resistance comes from religious groups, in this particular case (the right to die/assisted death) there are non-religious groups - or they have reasonable (non-religious) reasons - that are campaigning. Off the top of my head a couple of arguments they put forth is that changing the law to allow disabled/ill people to die when they choose (if they need to be assisted) will lead to the idea that ""such lives are worth less"" and result in disabled people being viewed as disposable, and also that people will kill themselves due to real or perceived pressure/guilt from carers/family.

true,terry_has_boots,wight,Isle of Wight,"I got exactly the same grades as you last year (A in French, History and English Language, and B in English Literature), and I got AAA* this year- and I'm going to Oxford in October. (I also got an offer from Warwick, but obviously I'm not taking it.)

My advice on History would be this: do the resit in the weaker History exam in January, **not** June. I did an extra AS in Government and Politics this year, and sitting that (even when it didn't matter) a month before my final A2 exams was hell. Do it in January, and if you don't do as well as you would have liked then don't worry; it is still totally possible to get an A or A* overall (I scraped a B by a mark or two in my Tudor paper last year, didn't resit, and still got an A this year). Do *not* jeopardise your final exam by resitting at the wrong time. Your resit should go quite well, however; A2 History is similar in format to AS (no 12-mark questions though (that's if you're studying AQA)), but much more in depth, so AS should hopefully seem a bit easier- not to mention your style of essay writing should have matured and improved by then.

Drop the grade B subject. You might think 'Oh, well I can still get an A next year', and you *can*, but the stress is immense. It's bad enough going into an A2 exam when you're already sitting on an A, but going in thinking you need to excel to drag your grade up is even worse. You want to do everything in your power to make sure the final exam is just the cherry on the cake, not something to pull the rest of your grade up.

Don't worry too much about thinking if you did 'well' or 'badly' in the exams; so often it's impossible to tell. The best you can do is scrutinise the mark scheme until you know it basically off by heart, and learn *everything* your teachers tell you to- even the stuff that's unlikely to come up. You don't want to leave anything to chance.

Oh, and prepare yourself for Oxford interviews. You might get interviewed by panels of two or three people, and prepare yourself not to get asked any questions on your personal statement or A-Levels; in three interviews I only got asked once about books I said I'd read in my personal statement, and never about my A-Level courses. (This was for French, though, not PPE.) Edit: They're testing your ability to *think*, not your ability to spout stuff about A-Level courses. Also, I would advise (though, again, I don't know an awful lot about PPE) doing some extra-curricular reading about your course; they like to see extra-curricular intellectual enthusiasm for the course, not just that you're doing it at A-Level.

It'd be a good idea to start on your personal statement now (if you haven't already), and make sure three or four careers advisors/teachers read it through. Don't put too much of an emphasis on extra-curricular activities such as sport in it; the top universities like to see that you do those things, but your personal statement should be about 4/5s academic. They don't really give a toss how much you love teaching kids to read- just use a couple of adjectives, don't take up 200 words talking about it.

true,mrsbanana,null,null,"I am in no way an expert, but I enjoy the races and have been going with my dad for 30 years.

At the races:

- Buy a racecard. This is the programme for the day and includes details of the races/horses/trainers/riders.

- Before a race, go to the ring. Here you can watch the horses walk around before the race. Have a look to see which ones look good to you. Do they look alert? muscley? unhappy? etc. 

- Look at your racecard. Do you fancy any of the horses just because of their name? (it's not a scientific reason but it *is* good fun!) Do you pick a horse with no chance because it's called 'mrsbanana wins a grand', or the favourite, called 'mrsBstinksofarse'? At Christmas I had a 33/1 winner and picked up a couple of hundred quid - just because I took a punt on a name which had meaning for me! It was hilarious the reactions around me on the stand when it came in!

- Have a look at the odds and calculate what sort of risk you're willing to take. The 2/1 favourite is more likely to win than a 33/1 horse, but your winnings will be much smaller.

- Take a look at the horses' 'form' on the race card. This explains the deatils of the horse and its recent results. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_%28horse_racing%29) wiki explains it better than I could.

- Listen to the course announcer who will tell you about the horses' last results and what the ground was like. Some horses run better on soggy ground than dry.

Placing your bet. The thre easiest/most common are 'to win', 'place' and 'each way

- 'To win' - you collect if the horse comes first, at the odds you chose to take (we'll come back to this). So, if you place a 'to win' bet of £1 at 10/1 and your horse wins, you'll get £10 + your £1 stake back.

- 'Place' - you collect if the horse comes first, or in a close losing position. The number of places depends on how many horses were in the race. For instance, in a race of a small field, you could collect on 1st &amp; 2nd, in a large race it could go up to 4th. You do not collect the full odds on a place bet, you win 1/4 or 1/5 of the odds again depending on how many runners.

- 'Each way' - This is a combination of the two previous bets. You're effectively betting twice. If you said ""£1 each way on MrEd"" it would cost you £2 - one 'to win' bet and one 'place' bet. Most people would choose to bet either 'to win' or 'each way'.

- The odds you see on the screens will be the Tote odds. 'Taking the price' doesn't apply at the 'Tote'. Tote bets pay a dividend on a pool, not fixed odds. How much you get depends on how much has been wagered.

- Just go up to the bookie and tell your bet to the cashier. No real need for betting slips anymore. *""A pound to win on no.4, please""*... or *""£5 each way on no.10""* If you don't say anything about the odds when placing your bet, your odds will be calculated as at whatever they were when the race started.

Odds:

- 'Taking the price'. When you place your bet you can choose to 'take the price' (which means the odds as they are that moment) or if you don't say anything you'll be given the 'starting price'. Before a race, the odds on a horse can change, depending on how many people are betting on it. The odds can get shorter if the horse is popular or longer if it's not fancied. Eg. the horse started out at 33/1, then changed to 25/1, then to 22/1. Lots of people have decided to bet on this horse and the bookie doesn't want to pay out a fortune if it does indeed win. Obviously, it's better for you if you can choose to take the 25/1 than the 22/1 (or even lower if it continues falling until the race starts). However, the odds may change to your disadvantage. It's another layer of the gamble. You would say to the cashier *""£5 win on no.8 - and I'll take the price, please""*

The law needs changing, this much is obvious.  But issues like this are a relatively recent phenomenon, and the law does tend to lag a little.

Even with RvP their strike force isn't as good as ours, and the difference is one key injury or suspension has the potential to really threaten their ability to score goals. I have a rather low opinion of Welbeck and it looks like Cheatarito may be on the way out.

I, like most, am concerned about our defense. One key injury isn't going to kill our attack, but it could create big holes in defense like we saw last year. It would be nice to have some more cover back there, although I'm not entirely uncomfortable with Richards taking a more central defensive role when he does.

It bears repeating that we won the title with the same team we're putting out this year, minus Tevez for much of it. The team seems more on-board with Mancini and have a year's worth of familiarity amongst themselves. That's going to be worth a lot.

I don't think Arsenal are going to pull it together this year to make a title push. They'll be 3rd or 4th most likely. Not even fussed with Liverpool or Spurs this year. Tooners overperformed last year; I think they'll be back mid-table. Everton will improve a couple of places, have a nice cup run, and make the Europa league one way or another. I think QPR will be in the top half despite what the pundits are suggesting about how they'll have to avoid relegation again.

The advice already here should be enough. As for picking out winners it'll probably be pretty tough to find a winner with no experience of betting on horses. Usually the market will point you in the right direction (i.e. the shorter priced horses are being backed across the country and for good reason). However the market isn't always going to find the winner and favourites only win 1 in 4 or something similar.

I went and had a quick look at the card and saw a few horses but only have one standout recommendation: Getabuzz in the 5pm. This is my favourite horse so instantly jumped out - has a win round Doncaster at the same distance so should be a sound bet, certainly each way value. Also try First Class or Alkadi in the first race each-way if the price is right (i.e. over 5/1, otherwise go for a single to win bet)

One thing on each way bets - they are handy for betting on big priced horses but if the horses prices is less than 4/1 (or 5/1 with some bookies) you won't get all your money back even if the horse does come second or third (or fourth). This is because the each way part of the bet is settled at 1/4 (or 1/5) of the odds for winning. 

The second race may be a good opportunity to find a big winner by selecting a horse randomly. It is for 2 year old horses and at that stage there is an element of randomness and the winners can be big prices as there is no form to go on.",0,1345137334,null,0,1345245416,0,c5u4ysj,t3_ybo31,t1_c5u4ysj,t3_ybo31,null,1429655573,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's not rape. The actual Swedish allegation is sexual molestation which revolves around an alleged misuse of a condom. This is your trouble, you are letting the BBC determine your opinion. [Many official documents have been released regarding the Swedish event](http://rixstep.com/1/20110204,04.shtml). We know for example one woman didn't want to pursue charges and wouldn't sign her witness statement. We know Assange stayed in Sweden but was then allowed to leave. I've read the leaked transcripts and rape just isn't there, it makes it obvious why the prosecution was immediately dropped. Later it was picked up again. That is very odd indeed.

The US has slowly been building a case against Wikileaks, from the Bradley Manning court hearings we know they are after '7 civilians and managers of Wikileaks' being targeted. This includes an icelandic politician that has been told by her own government, not to travel to the US because it is too dangerous. Interpol put Assange on a red list (the sort Bin Ladin might get on) without charges just so he could be questioned.

The extradition was a means to an end, it locked Assange in limbo and bled his finances dry whilst the US built a case against him. You're saying US extradition is 'stupid', so why on earth have US officials screamed 'terrorist' at Assange, that he has broken US law and he should face justice there? Why haven't either the US or Sweden assured Assange that there would be no extradition to the US? The (poorly kept) secret Grand Jury is very, very real. Why do all this and not then do the logical next step, get Assange to the US to be prosecuted?

I think this is the crux. Some do 'give it their all', some don't.

A player like Jay Spearing, who does his utmost for the club but can't quite make the contribution he would like deserves nothing but respect and warm feelings, but at the same time it's not wrong to think that his future probably lies elsewhere and that it would be better for all parties if he made a move sooner rather than later.

Other players do not give the impression that they are giving their all; but rather that they've come in thinking they've arrived as a big man at a big club and can sit on their laurels. It's completely reasonable for the fans who pay their massive wages to resent this and give them some stick; that's always been the way. There is no obligation to give some hapless whopper who can't get anything right unconditional support just because he's wearing the red shirt.

The issue you're having is that you're treating something he's saying with seriousness. As I mentioned, the guy is in character 100% of the time, whether he intends to be or not or whether he has just spent so much time in character it's become a natural habitual factor of the false persona he portrays publicly like 99.9% of all people.

The point being that THAT is part of the humour too. Stop taking anything seriously, it's not. It's a joke. It's an obvious joke. I honestly find it difficult to believe people do not understand this, Americans perhaps but Britons? It's quintessential self deprecating, self parodying British humour. It strikes me as though the circlejerk of loving to hate Clarkson (and act outraged) causes people to pretend that what he says ought to be taken as if he's serious. It's like people put on humour blindfolds and ear plugs so that they can act all outraged completely unnecessarily. The only thing I can take from that is that many many British people LOVE to complain and be outraged at things.

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/9/section/1

&gt; (1)After subsection (1) of section 61 of the M1Water Industry Act 1991 (disconnection for non-payment of charges) there is inserted—
“(1A)The power conferred by subsection (1) above is not exercisable in relation to any premises specified in Schedule 4A to this Act.”

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/56/schedule/4A

&gt; (2)In this paragraph “dwelling” means—
(a)a private dwelling-house (which may be a building or part of a building),
(b)a caravan within the meaning of Part I of the M1Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 (disregarding the amendment made by section 13(2) of the M2Caravan Sites Act 1968), or
(c)a boat or similar structure designed or adapted for use as a place of permanent habitation.

It's not a private dwelling-house, it's an embassy - and no, the legal fiction ""man on the street"" will not consider it to be a house. It's not a caravan and it's certainly not a fucking boat. I quote the relevant bits here; there is a long list of other things that the Ecuadorian embassy is not, such as a hospital and a fire station, should you wish to peruse it.

And this is all irrelevant, because it only actually applies to disconnection for *non-payment of charges*.

I've even been for an interview over lunch where later on it was commented on approvingly that I ate peas in the correct manner.

We have a culture where it's perfectly acceptable to take the piss out of the underclass and the upper middle/upper classes are an immediately identifiable social grouping with what I'd consider to be well acknowledged traits. 

At university it was noticeable how some people after a semester had switched from serviette to napkin etc.

In business it's very easy to tell who went to public schools and Oxbridge connections are very noticeable and well used.

Some people retain the culture of the class their ancestors belonged to, but not necessarily the wealth. The rest of us are a mixture of more than one culture.

In America they use the classes to refer to income, and sometimes this is adopted by the British because our traditional class distinctions no longer work.

I made a comment on a social news aggregation website. That's hardly making a decision, and being ""informed"" is not a prerequisite for a comment or suggestion.

You appear to like superlatives: ""no idea what you're talking about"" ""completely uninformed"".

Actually, I am pretty informed. I'm as informed as I can reasonably be while working a 8-6 job in a sector very much removed from what is currently in discussion.

The idea that I somehow have to fulfill a list of preconditions for talking about a subject is ridiculous. Debates on this subreddit and reddit in general cover such a massive range of topics that it is preposterous to expect everyone to be as clued up as each other on every topic.

""So keep your fucking trap shut"", I hear you cry. Well, no. That's not how a site like this works - if you want to stroke your cock on a specialist website where a certain level of knowledge on a subject is required, go to a specialist website or a specialist subreddit. God knows there are enough politics subreddits around.

I find the fact that I am wrong unremarkable. I am often wrong. But what I do find remarkable is your *exasperation* that I have the audacity to post something incorrect, then say I don't have the time to study primary sources. Yeah, the vienna convention. That's lovely light reading - I might print a copy out and read it in the bath tonight.

Where's the ""souls"" argument coming from? Humanists don't believe in souls, but many are of the same opinion that a human life is 'special'. That said, of course they do not in general think its 'sacred' in the regular sense. However I'm sure that there are some Humanists that do not agree with assisted dying. Also I have no doubt, though I have not asked every single one, that there are people who are against any change in legislation but are non-religious. Probably quite a few.

&gt; Obviously this strange turn around isn't religiously motivated at all.

The law wasn't written all of a sudden - I imagine it's been this way for a very long time.

&gt; It's simply religious versus secular.

No, really, it's not. And I don't say that because I have any vested interest: If it *were* simply religious versus secular then it'd make me very happy, because ultimately the religious arguments cannot win out over those who are not religious (or even those who are, actually).

There are numerous groups that don't have a religious affiliation. A fairly obvious one is the BMA: look at what they said today about the ruling! Of course, it's possible for individual members to be religious and use that as their motivation, but when their reasoning is clearly not religious in nature, I'm not sure how you can conclude it is.

If you have a job interview, for example. Or you get into an argument with a stranger. Or you engage a stranger in friendly conversation.

And people *absolutely* adapt their accent to suit the purpose.

Take Received Pronunciation (RP) for example, as mentioned by therealmorris.

RP will do you very well most of the time. It's often seen as the best accent to adopt. A ""telephone manner"" is often adopted when speaking to strangers who you want to conduct business with. A telephone manner is a ""perfect"" form of RP, as opposed to the more relaxed version that most people use. Despite it's name, it's not just used on the telephone, but also in shops, job interviews etc. So, people often make their voice *more* RP.

But RP isn't always best. Go somewhere rough up North and RP turns you into a bit of a target. Radio DJs never speak with RP. If RP is their natural accent, they'll change it. RP speakers also tend to hide their accent if in social situations with people who speak with Southern working class accents (cockney, etc) or if they want to appear working class, giving rise to the phrase ""Mockney"" (Jamie Oliver is a celebrated example of this). RP can be seen as arrogant, or old fashioned. So often people will try and *hide* their RP accent.

Other accents are similarly exaggerated and hidden depending on the situation.

It can lead to some wierd situations. For example, lots of call centres love to recruit Scottish people because the Scottish accent is seen as trustworthy.

Most accents have positives to weigh against the negatives. There are few accents that are just plain negative. So few people get totally screwed by their accent.

There are some accents that shall remain un-named that I can see no good things about, which makes me sad :(

By the way, in case you're wondering, European accents are not generally seen as negative. As a Norweigan, your aim should be to be intelligible.

true,insoundfromwayout,null,null,"Firstly, it's not rape, it's a type of sexual assault charge that exists under Swedish law, which works out to be something similar to having unprotected sex with consent. Also, he has not been charged yet, he is just wanted for questioning. So the image of a rapist, hiding in back alleys and grabbing girls off the street is not really applicable here, even if he is to be found guilty, what he would be guilty of is not much more than having sex without a condom.

Secondly, there seems to be some confusion about what Wikileaks is. In a similar sort of way to the 'rape' idea outlined above, there seems to be a lot of misinformation about it, making it look bad, or making it out to be some sort of quasi-terrorist organization. 

Wikileaks is a not-for-profit organization which gives a platform for people to anonymously leak information which they feel is in the public interest, and works to do what it can to prevent the whistle-blower from being persecuted. For example, if you were in the army, and you saw some terrible war atrocities committed by your higher-ups, you might feel you have nowhere you can go; if you were to go to the papers, you would get in a lot of trouble with your superiors, and may even be in danger depending on how serious the event was. 

Wikileaks is designed for these situations, giving a person in this position a place to go, and uses it's expertise to delete 'digital fingerprints' from videos or recordings you may want leaked so that it is not traced back to you, and also guarantees (as much as possible) anonymity. In the event that your anonymity *is* breached, Wikileaks will send legal help, and where needed, money, to help fight any legal battles you may find yourself in. All for free, all not-for-profit, all in the name of the idea of a free-press.

One of the most famous leaks was regarding the July 12th 2007 Baghdad bombings. A video was hosted on wikileaks, showing an American gunship opening fire on a group of un-armed men in the streets, two of which later turned out to be Reuters journalists. The video had been suppressed up until it's publishing by Wikileaks. You can watch it here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0

Anyway, your question was ""Can someone summarise why the public opinion is with Assange here?""

Many people feel that Wikileaks is a fantastic organization which promotes transparency and free speech. The people being killed in that video are all *somebody's* sons, perhaps brothers, fathers, and it's hard to imagine how frustrating it must be to have someone you loved be killed by in such a way, only for their death to be covered up because the institution that killed them is so big as to be 'untouchable'. Or from another angle, some Americans feel they are better off knowing that their tax dollars are paying for the army to carry out these sorts of acts, and that the people involved should be held accountable. Many members of the public thus see Wikileaks and Jullian Assange as good forces in the world, and thus give them their full support.

So in conclusion; you seemed confused as to why there was so much support for a man who is wanted for sexual assault in another country. You are correct that if this were just some two bit rapist, there would not be hundreds of people holding banners and marching outside the embassy he is in right now. The reason *why* is because he is not just some two bit rapist, but in fact is seen by many as an important force for good in modern journalism.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"I'll repost what I wrote in /r/soccer a couple days ago:


Really tough to gauge most of the top teams. City will almost certainly be top four. They are the only team with quality and depth in all positions and consistent coaching.

United have quality at most positions but hardly as much depth as they've had in the past. They didn't have as good of a transfer window as they expected (even though it's not over yet). They manage to play a lot of players out of positions and are still struggling to find a consistent partner for Vidic at the back. They might get RvP, but there's no way he can replicate his achievements from last season. If either him or Rooney gets injured, their season could take a nasty turn. Their biggest problem is that they still play without a solid centre mid far too often. They are far too reliant on Scholes, as we saw last season.

Chelsea are either going to be incredible this year and vie for the title or they're going to burn out and finish 5/6. Honestly, it's great that RDM won the Champions League for you last year, but all he's shown me so far is that he's a Cup manager rather than a League manager. His results in the Premier League left a lot to be desired. I don't see a way he can survive the Roman axe this year. They've brought in a ton of players with a plethora of talent, but it's really tough to get the chemistry right when you have so many superstars. I think Hazard is a bit overrated and a bit selfish when he doesn't need to be. Oscar still needs time to mature. Their season will most likely hinge on the play of Fernando Torres, though I've heard Az/Hulk might be coming in.

Arsenal are in a similar position. They've brought in a lot of solid talent, but nothing is to say that they will build chemistry. I think Podolski will be one of the biggest flops of the transfer window (though I really hope I'm wrong - I love to see Germans succeed). Barring last season, he's never really had a great club season. The one thing he's always brought are international performances and he had a Euro tournament to forget. Giroud is a good striker, but he needs quality service from the wings (where Arsenal still seem to be lacking). Also, with Cazorla in that midfield, it's getting awfully cramped, especially considering there's only 3 spots available. Their season will depend upon the fate of Song's transfer and Wilshere's fitness.

I highly doubt Tottenham will be as good as last year. They've added some players, but they have no striker as of right now. They can have all the talent in the midfield, but if there is no one there to finish off the chances, it won't matter. I expect Modric to go to Madrid, and with Spurs only in the Europa League, I can't see them finding a way to replace him (not that he's even replaceable). On top of that, I think AVB will struggle to produce the same amount of success 'Arry had at White Hart Lane. His tactics take a while to implement (as we saw at Chelsea last year).

Liverpool is going through a similar transition. The difference is that Rodgers doesn't have past experiences to haunt him like AVB does. From a team that finished 8th, he can only go up from there. On top of that, Lucas is back from injury, Borini, Allen, and Assaidi have been brought in, with Dempsey and Sahin likely to follow. If they can manage to keep both Carroll and Agger, they will be a force to be reckoned with. For the first time in four years, they will have quality and depth at all positions. I think the linchpin for Liverpool's season will be the play between Gerrard and Suarez. Already we've seen in the friendlies/Europa League qualifying that Gerrard is play a second striker role (much as he did in 08-09). Rodgers realizes that Gerrard is aging and that he should either be played there, where all of his skills can be used, or he shouldn't have to waste his energy. Unless they get as unlucky as last year (30+ posts), I don't see them finishing below 5th.

that people in a host country won't harass, kill, imprison, or otherwise commit crimes against diplomats that embassies won't deliberately flout the laws of their host country, and provide immunity to criminals without cause. If anyone has disregarded convention and principle, it is not the UK - the first undermining of diplomacy came from Ecuador.

Looking at that phrase though, I am confused as to how it helped you reach that conclusion. It doesn't do any of the following, which might reasonably lead you to believe that I am, if not a shill, at least in opposition to your position:

1. it doesn't say that Assange is guilty

2. it doesn't even say that the accusations are credible (personally, from what little I know of them, they do not seem that convincing)

So, at no point have I expressed a view at odds with you so far . What that phrase does say is that:

1. I find the trivialization of rape disheartening

2. many people in the linked-through thread do not see rape as particularly serious

You can absolutely disagree with the second point - it is, after all, my subjective judgement. You can attack my words on those grounds.

That is not, however, what you have done. To reiterate, I used a phrase that doesn't say anything to disagree with your reading of the situation - it is entirely possible that the US is seeking to secretly extradite Assange *and* that rape is a serious crime. And yet that phrase is one you single out as especially damning. Disregarding your issues with the rest of the post, I find that really strange.

It would be churlish not to give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume that you didn't mean it like that. At the moment, what you seem to be saying is that ""thinks rape is serious"" is a defining characteristic of partisan shills, and that it is a trait not shared by you and those who agree with you.

Is that really what you meant? It seems very unlikely, but I am really struggling here to discern another possible motive for highlighting that sentence. Do you genuinely think that rape is not a serious issue? It wouldn't be the first time I've heard it defended on Reddit, but that commenter was really, really strange.

I'd argue having key members of the US Government publicly consider having you assassinated (bearing in mind, he's an Australian national) makes you a political figure. 

And he isn't fleeing Sweden, he said he would stand trial in Sweden IF Sweden guaranteed that he wouldn't be extradited to the US because if he goes there, he faces execution. Sweden couldn't make this guarantee. 

This all boils down to the US, Sweden dropped the charges at one point due to lack of evidence. Then they suddenly reopened the case, even though no new evidence had come to light, now you have the UK (A good ally of the US) considering ignoring the Geneva convention.. which would make us one of only two other countries to ever do so.

I don't really care for Assange, but I can't ignore how weird this has got, it's gone from him fearing the US, to Sweden potentially reopening charges to get him extradited to the US, and the UK challenging another countries Sovereignty... it's just ridiculous.

Actually it is.

He can go through many appeals which will take years.  In Sweden, they can just hand him over without our consent.

It's why he's so desperate not to go, he will be tortured in America just like Manning.

&gt; Sweden is bound by different extradition agreements. It is not meant to grant onwards extradition to a third country without agreement from the extraditing country. But at the same level of the legal hierarchy there is a bilateral treaty between the US and Sweden that allows for extradition without consent from the UK or minimum tests. This is the temporary surrender/conditional release regime - automatic extradition on a loan basis. It is highly likely that the United States will soon request Julian Assange’s extradition from Sweden and this mechanism will be used while Julian Assange is in Swedish custody.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Thanks for a very thorough response, I really appreciate it. You've helped me to get some background and to look at the issue in a wider sense. I have learned a lot since I asked the question and therefore have a couple of points to make on what you say.

&gt;Firstly, it's not rape, it's a type of sexual assault charge that exists under Swedish law, which works out to be something similar to having unprotected sex with consent.

[Maybe, according to the BBC, these are the charges:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11937110)

&gt;Used his body weight to hold down Miss A in a sexual manner.

Very vague - I can imagine situations where that could be described as rape and situations where it is a playful sexual act.

&gt;Had unprotected sex with Miss A when she had insisted on him using a condom.

Not the best thing anyone's ever done but not rape exactly

&gt;Molested Miss A ""in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity"".

Fuck knows what that means.

&gt;Had unprotected sex with Miss W while she was asleep.

That's pretty rapey as far as I'm concerned, obviously we don't know the exact situation but someone can't give consent in their sleep.

&gt; So the image of a rapist, hiding in back alleys and grabbing girls off the street is not really applicable here, even if he is to be found guilty...

Agreed

&gt;Secondly, there seems to be some confusion about what Wikileaks is. In a similar sort of way to the 'rape' idea outlined above, there seems to be a lot of misinformation about it, making it look bad, or making it out to be some sort of quasi-terrorist organization.

I support wikileaks, absolutely. I have donated money to them in the past. I think however that wikileaks can and will survive without Assange. I'm sure the American government also realise this so I don't see why they would want to get rid of this one man when the organisation carries on.

I think the answer to my original question is that people asume that he will be extradited to the USA. I wouldn't support that however I don't really see any evidence either way on that score.

I'm still undecided on the issue but I think there's a lot of misinformation on both sides.

It was a good read, don't worry. 

Firstly, that's basically my issue with them not making a guarantee, they can make the guarantee if he faces execution, but they've chosen not to do so. 

&gt;So why would America concoct a fake set of allegations in order for the Swedish authorities to have grounds to issue an extradition request to the UK, let the UK follow all the processes involved in allow him to appeal, get him sent to Sweden, so they could begin a second round of extradition proceedings to bring him to the United States?

This is basically where my doubt lies, I don't understand what is going on simply put - too many things appear to just be outright... weird. 

&gt;We're not the ones charging him with the rape allegations. 

No one's charging him with rape allegations, remember, the *potential* charges he faces in Sweden are what equate to 'misuse of a condom' in layman's terms. 

&gt; This would effectually mean removing their right to have an embassy. At no point would we set foot on their soil and breach the Vienna convention.

I'd argue that the Vienna convention overrides an act of UK Parliament. 

&gt;Article 31. The host nation may not enter the consular premises, and must protect the premises from intrusion or damage.

The law the UK would enact, would directly go against this. 

And secondly, threatening to remove an embassy is a threat against a countries sovereignty as it has a direct impact on their international presence. ",0,1345148440,null,0,false,0,c5u89aq,t3_ybfpl,t1_c5u89aq,t1_c5u7yt2,null,1429657202,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"This is one of the most harrowing books I've ever read on paraplegia and the right to die - www.2arms1head.com written by a young guy who snapped his spine in a motorcycle accident. It shows his view on his disability (in disturbing detail) and his journey to end his life. This quote seems apt to the people from SPUC Pro-life - 

   ""The people at Not Dead Yet take issue with the idea of providing assisted suicide to the severely disabled and not to healthy, able-bodied people, by calling it a “deadly double standard”.  You’re goddamn right it’s a double standard you fucking lunatics!  Why is there a double standard?  Because on the one hand we’re talking about healthy human beings and on the other about nightmarishly, gruesomely, horribly disabled human beings.  Do you see, readers, what these people want to do to you?  They want to force you to live your lives as heads attached to corpses.  They don’t want you to have any choice in the matter. 
 
  Don’t these people not frighten you?  Can you imagine being locked in a torture chamber for the next thirty years of your life?  That is what those “Not Dead Yet” people want to do to you!  Don’t say there aren’t horribly twisted people out there and just because a person has a J.D. and wears a suit does not mean she is not a monster.  They are out there, waiting to lay their hands on you!  They want to bring lawsuits, stage protests, do anything they can to keep you imprisoned in a dead body if you are ever so horribly unlucky as to end up there.  Beware!  And let’s not pretend that it’s a simple matter for a head to commit suicide.  Because that’s part of their line, they are not against suicide but against assisted suicide.  I imagine a head quadriplegic could ask for some gum and then huff it down his windpipes, but otherwise what is there?  Drive their sip-and-puff wheelchairs in front of trains or trucks and risk the lives of others?  Ask to be taken to lakes so they can drive off of docks?  So about the best they can hope for is either suffocating/drowning or dying traumatically and endangering others.

Our concierge went and had a word with one of the hotel bosses who then spoke to the club's PR guy and they agreed that my wife and I could go through and meet them and have our photos taken with them! They even said we could leave our guestbook with them overnight and they all signed it. Got photos with Drogba, Cole, Anelka, Malouda, Kakuta, Kalou, Mikel, Zhirkov, Ivanovic, Ancelotti, Ray Wilkins, Essien, and Bruma. In the morning when we went for our breakfast we saw Essien again and Daniel Sturridge wandering around aimlessly looking for the milk for his cornflakes! It was amazing... I'm pretty sure I'm probably the only bloke in the country or possibly world that has randomly met the premiership team that he supports on his wedding day xD

Sounds like a challenge to me, how's this for a Kirk like solution:

* The UK agrees to let Assange leave for Ecuador providing that he is tried in Ecuador under Swedish law (like the [Lockerbie trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103_bombing_trial) that was conducted in the Netherlands under Scottish law).
* Ecuador grants Assange citizenship.
* Sweden and Ecuador sign some form of prisoner transfer agreement and use that to allow Assage to serve any Swedish jail time in an Ecuadorian prision.

This way:

* The Swedish women get justice.
* Assange has Ecuadorian protection against extradition to the US.
* The UK can keep both Sweden and Ecuador happy.

However he also declared the national debt void as he said it was due to corrupt regimes and he has argued for a South American currency to replace the US dollar in trading. He has also expropriated and nationalised some industries in the public interest.

This earns him the ire of the wealthy and powerful, and the Americans, they then use the media and the NGO's to slander him and stir up revolt. I can't blame him for defending himself.

To be honest I don't know why people are refusing to listen to a man who freed information for us all so that we can all make our on judgments and instead listen to the slanderous allegations of a [woman linked to the CIA](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/12/06/assange-rape-accuser-cia-ties/) made long after the supposed act occurred.

Getting on the 'oh it must be rape because of x y z and you are disgusting for saying otherwise' does no one any good. If you had followed this properly right from the beginning, as I did, you would know why it is not as it has been made out to be. All you are doing is jumping on a bandwagon, *if* there had been anything more to it than what I have described the Swedish police would have put out a warrant for his arrest, and he would have been arrested before he left Sweden. As it is there is not enough to arrest him on, hence he is wanted for *questioning*, a very different scenario. As it is the evidence for anything was regarded as insufficient, hence the case was closed, and only reopened when one of the women contacted a lawyer who realised who Assange was and the money signs just popped up. It is also that same lawyer who contacted the states and gave them the info that they might be able to bring Assange in for questioning. 

This is all well known to people who have been following this, and its not difficult to find over the internet, although it is more difficult now since some sites have 'disappeared' under pressure.

Traditionally the middle class has been the professional/highly educated class who owned their property and have the assets to give the children a head start and the ability to pass on significant wealth. The traditional working class were not property owners and did not have the sort of assets that made inheritance a significant factor in standard of living.

As there is large group of people for whom this is not possible I don't consider them to be middle class and would say they were working class or possibly underclass.

This is a financial view of class.

The other way of looking at it is that middle class embodies a certain set of traits and behaviours which put an emphasis on education, respectability and culture. Again a large section of the population does not share these beliefs and in my view are not middle class.

We can read into it further by saying they must have found some merit because they went against the demands of the home country, which is perfectly acceptable. The moment Assange entered the embassy he became an asylum seeker, so now we have two jurisdictions pointing at two conflicting pieces of law of equal merit and claiming one was more important.

The rapiness of it all is irrelevant, and any one who states that Assange's position as an asylum seeker is just isn't demeaning the seriousness of rape (nor the allegations of misuse of a condom). There is a case to be made that Sweden undermined the seriousness of the accusations because they have been dismissed once and Assange was allowed to leave the country. The (non)rape victim went on to sleep with him again and she beamed on twitter that Assange was staying with her. To say that this is a clear case of go-face-the-allegations-and-clear-your-name, is a crude simplification. There is clear evidence of a malicious and deceitful prosecution. I'm going to ignore you link to Wikipedia because I've seen the Anna Arden tweets, I've seen all primary material and I've read through the Crown's extradition decision.

To summarise events between you and I:

1. You entered this thread ~""believing it when you see it"". (Did you read the translation?) You could have easily said ""I'll believe the US doesn't want Assange tried on espionage charges when they go on record saying they don't"". They, the most prominent being Joe Biden, did go on record stating he was a terrorist; we know their track record with terrorists.
1. You started throwing around insults, I'm presumably mentally 'unbalanced'. You didn't say my argument was biased, you said I might be unbalanced.
1. I checked your history and found that [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/ybi98/julian_assange_is_the_white_knight_the_world/c5u1pnc), I highlighted all the overtly emotional language, which suggests that the coyness about ""what makes you think I am not as skeptical of the UK government's position"" is not at all genuine. You clearly hold firm beliefs.
1. The 'moronic shouts' also have come from the Ecuadorean government.
1. To dismiss them it makes sense that you are adhering to the narrative coming from the likes of William Hague (that doesn't imply you idolise him), and the foreign office.
1. You started to focus on the seriousness of rape, and claimed that I demeaned it. This is just nonsense.

Nope that is a relatively recent creation. The middle class were those with enough money to threaten the power of the upper classes. People who owned factories, pits and other infrastructure during the industrial revolution.

The ""traditional"" position you are suggesting is exactly the corruption that has been pushed by the Tory party for years. Mainly to get people to believe they benefit from policies designed to protect rich people.

The definitions Marx gave were inline with the traditional definition of the middle class. That definition got changed as socialism rose. Mainly so they could equivocate in various debates.

No because you are twisting what has been said to fit your own end. I quote ""Assange is accused of ""pinning down"" one of the women to have sex without a condom""

No he isn't accused of that. 

&gt;I make absolutely no judgement on whether he's guilty.

Hahahahahah! Yeah right! 

&gt;All I want is for him to answer these allegations

Why? What has it got to do with you? Are you on a moral high horse then? **He has already been questioned and answered the allegations the first time.** The case was dropped after that. It was reopened a short while after by the Director of Public prosecutions, why? Because of who he is and because by then the USA had got wind of it and become involved. Also the lawyer now representing the two women is an MP, always influential and seeking to gain more influence. He is also a weird bloke who fully believes that ALL men carry some guilt because SOME men have attacked women before. 

Of course you will know all this having familiarised yourself fully before making comments on here.... /s.

She also taught me not to be afraid of freezing food. Since then, I'll spend an afternoon cooking, and that's my meals for the week and a few lunches sorted.

---------------

* City will win by not dropping stupid points to teams they shouldn't be losing points to.

* United are consistently good, they rarely drop points and this new Rooney + RVP combo scares the fuck out of me. Rooney already looks better than ever and RVP is coming off his best season ever, combining the 2 highest Goal scorers in the league last season and should they click, you're looking at a back 4's nightmare. What we can hope is;

 * RVP struggles to find form in United

 * RVP injures himself

 * Rooney and RVP fail to work well with one another (like Lampard and Gerrard) 

* Chelseas new attacking power headed by Torres is more than likely due to be (in my OP) the most devastating in the PL, IF they have lost their demons and have found a taste for goal and if they can work with one another. Torres in form is a veeeeery scary thing, when he was at Liverpool I would have said he was in the top 3 best strikers in the world, he has dropped form since then, but he is desperate to turn it around and this could be that season

* We look good. We look better than we have looked in years. Our new team is younger, faster, more energetic and well adapted to the new system we are playing.  The only way is up, but just how far up are we able to go?

* Arsenal have lost their golden goose, the man that single handedly carried them all last season, regardless of what anyone says and regardless of their new purchases Arsenal are going to struggle, I find it hard to believe somebody will be able to produce the same number of goals as RVP did.

* Tottenham have lost Magic 'arry, arguably the man who turned it all around for them in the first place and with again, there best playing now leaving them they will struggle to replace the magic modric produced for them

If we just ignore the big elephant in the room the USA and focus on the entire reason for the extraction, the alleged rape.

If there is enough evidence to support these claims, and as such is a valid European Arrest Warrant, even though it doesn't sound like a crime in this country and would normally be except under ""Double Criminality"" that does allow rape as one of the categories to be ignored under DC (Essentially rape in one country is classified under the EAW as applying to all member states even if it isn't a law in the state being asked to effect the extraction).  

So looks like the EAW is correct and has enough evidence for sweden to process a trial, so this is when the UK courts came into action.

Assange goes through the court system using the full appeal process and eventually is denied on the basis on the above points (that rape in Sweden isn't rape in the UK and if he would recieve a fair hearing in Sweden).  It was always going to be a hard battle to win that argument.

Then poof, Assange high tails it to Ecuador embassy after negotiations (probably during the court case as mostly a delay tactic).

And now we come to the situation where Assange has broken bail conditions, and also passed the timeframe laid out by the EAW to extricate him, so as soon as he is outwith the protective boundaries of the Ecuador embassy he will be off to Sweden.


Options.

* Julian Assange comes out going ""Oh, all right, you've got me"" 

* The Goverments work together to agree surrender terms for Assange.

* The British Goverment drops Ecuadors protective status.

* Ecuador does some James Bond shit and smuggles him out.
 
* We wait until one of the above situation's comes true.


In reality only the one where all governments involved come together and agree on a course of action with Mr Assange is likely.


In my opinion, Mr Assange should be extradited to answer for his alledgeded crimes in Sweden.  So far the process is mostly correct and his rights are upheld.

I think City will have the league wrapped up with a few games to spare.  Chelsea will come together at some point when they find their best line-up.  United will start faster than Chelsea but age and depth will catch up a little and Chelsea will pass them in the end.  Arsenal are in too much flux to put them higher.  If they had held RVP and Song (who still could stay) I might go as high as second.  We'll be in a fight with Spurs for fifth.  Both clubs will get off to slow starts because Spurs are distracted by Modric and striker rumors and we have a brutal early season schedule.  If Spurs lose Modric but get Moutinho I probably put them ahead of us.  Maybe it comes down to injuries.

As a side note, I do believe the USA is pressuring Sweden to get him as Swedens extradition laws are less stringent than the UK's and more favourable to the USA.

The UK has more clout to withstand pressure from the USA (and a better defence system for Assange also), we probably said 
&gt;""Ok, we will do everything we can to extradite him to Sweden, but don't ask us to extradite him to the USA as we cannot comply with it, so don't risk the relationship""

Thats why I believe the UK hasn't been asked to extradite him to the USA (I mean look at Gary McKinnon, 8 years for hacking and taking defence systems offline in the USA, can you imagine how long Assange could string it out for).  Then theres the whole Public support in the UK where in Sweden he would be looked on as a Sexual Predator.

Also, for the first few weeks, at least, take part in all the events set up for first years. It's a good way of meeting the rest of your course. Sticking to your old school groups and avoiding these events could set you back a bit in settling in. The peer mentor group for the school will have some pizza and gaming nights as well as some initial events in the first week to help you in settling in.

And the class, our year was about 200 altogether, I hear yours will be even bigger! And you'll have some separate modules but a lot will be shared. Make sure to be early to lectures! I think they're considering putting the class in two lecture halls and streaming the lecture into the second. You want to make sure you're in the first if that's happening.

I assume by tutor's you mean staff, or are you mixing it up with the mentors? They're quite separate. The staff are very good. You may find yourself complaining about one or two but when you think about it even those are very good at what they do and have your interests at heart.

And who expected Newcastle to finish 5th last season? Not me.

But, I'll admit, these table predictions *are* fun.

Just for a laugh, I've taken the top teams from the last five seasons just to get a bit of an overview:

**2011-12**

1. Man City

2. Man U

3. Arsenal

4. Spurs

5. Newcastle

6. Chelsea

7. Everton

8. Liverpool

9. Fulham

**2010-11**

1. Man U

2. Chelsea

3. Man City

4. Arsenal

5. Spurs

6. Liverpool

7. Everton

**2009-10**

1. Chelsea

2. Man U

3. Arsenal

4. Spurs

5. Man City

6. Aston Villa

7. Liverpool

8. Everton

**2008-09**

1. Man U

2. Liverpool

3. Chelsea

4. Arsenal

5. Everton

**2007-08**

1. Man U

2. Chelsea

3. Arsenal

4. Liverpool

5. Everton

* First off, we haven't seen a 'classic' top four since the 07/08 and 08/09 season.

* It looks like Spurs and City have inched their way into the top four conversation.

* And, of course, Liverpool have fallen outside the top four the past few seasons.

* Man U have, unfortunately, have commanded the first or second spot for quite some time.

* Chelsea have consistently been right up there as well until last season (but they did win the Champions League, so there's that).

* Mind Everton hovering around either just out of the top 4 or just behind Liverpool, or, unfortunately, *ahead* of Liverpool last season.

* And other trends/observations, I'm sure.

So, after all that ... My prediction for **2012-13**?

1. Man U

2. Man City

3. Arsenal

4. Chelsea

5. Spurs

6. Liverpool

7. Everton

&gt;A state wishing to prosecute a surrendered person for offences committed before his or her surrender, or extradite a surrendered person to a third state, must, subject to certain exception, obtain the permission of the executing judicial authority. Such a request is made in the same form as a European Arrest Warrant, and granted or refused using the same rules which determine whether surrender would be granted or refused.

&gt;This requirement is referred to as the principle of specialty and is intended to ensure that a state cannot seek the surrender of a person for an extraditable offence whilst intending to prosecute that person for a non-extraditable offence once surrendered, or extradite the surrendered person to a third state for a offence which would not have been extraditable offence from the original executing state.

If thats what your talking about all it states that if Sweden were to pass him onto the USA, all the UK government has to do is look and see if the request was made to the UK, would the UK grant the extradition if he was still here.

true,vitaminbillwebb,troughton,Troughton,"Actually, I remember reading that RTD based his version of *Doctor Who* on *Buffy*'s story-arc structure. In fact, I think it's the central innovation of his tenure. The central innovation of Moffat's tenure is to adopt *LOST*'s story arcs that pile complications on top of each other. Both structures have dangers. The *Buffy* style requires that finales always build on each other and top each other. That was Davies' problem. His finales always had to be bigger and more fanservice-y to keep going. The *LOST* style requires that you be able to pull all that complexity together and make it pay off. It remains to be seen whether Moffat can do it. 

As for American television that's like *Doctor Who*, I don't think anything on any television show anywhere is like *Doctor Who*. *Who* is a show about a Sherlock-Holmes-cum-Gandalf-cum-Victorian-Inventor that gets dropped in a different story every week. Some times, those stories are a lot like *Star Trek*, but some times they're nothing like them. Some times they're like *Buffy* or *The X-Files* but some times they're not. Some times, they're Hammer horror films, but some times they're not. 

The only show that I know of that tries to do this, actually, is *Community*, a show that masquerades as a college comedy, but is actually just an excuse to throw its characters into a new genre every week.

The only way he can kill himself is by refusing to eat.  That would be a long and painful death perhaps taking several months.

His argument is that an able bodied person could take their own life in a quicker and less painful manner, e.g. by lethal injection/overdose.  Because he can't physically administer an injection himself or feed himself the pills, someone else would have to do it and would therefore be liable to a charge of murder.

He effectively wants to be able to be able to commit ""suicide by proxy"" by giving someone else permission to kill him.  But the judges have clarified that the law as it stands (for right or wrong) doesn't recognise this concept.  If you kill another person with malice aforethought (premeditation), then it is murder regardless of whether or not they wanted you to do it.

I also wondered about a hypothetical ""Spartacus Solution"" (to coin a phrase) whereby numerous different people all give him a single pill or non-lethal dose of morphine.  Collectively the effect would be to kill him but each individual could claim that it wasn't them.   Especially if some of the pills/injections were randomly assigned dummies.

I remember reading somewhere (not sure how true it is, mind you) that firings squads would be issued with one blank bullet which would be randomly assigned (presumably pre-loaded in a gun).  That way each man could believe that it was him who had been given the blank and could sleep at night knowing he hadn't fired the fateful bullet.

true,C2Taylor19,,King Cellino!,"Signings wise, I feel that all could make an impact but look out for Pearce to be a solid CB and he may likely be the captain. Paddy Kenny will be a great shot stopper and is a great last man to rely on. Personally I feel this season Rodolph Austin will take the championship by storm. He's a hard hitting defensive CM. He has a great eye for goal at range so keep an eye on him as I feel he could surprise us with a few great goals. Varney will also look to be making an impact as NW feels he is Snoddys replacement so I would expect him to be out on the right and trying to score us as many goals as he can. 

As far as how he has structured the team I feel we are in a much better position than we were last season. He has completely changed the team and looked at the weaknesses and improved them greatly. The defence has been boosted and so has the midfield. Personally I think he's done a great job.

Diouf, well this guy is claimed to be a wildcard. He has done great in the past for Liverpool and Lens and if the guys brings it here then i'll start to credit the lad. He's had a bit of anger issues but I think Warnock is going to try cut it all out. I think it's good he's on a non contract basis as it gives him time to study and look at Diouf before giving him a contract only for Diouf to do something to fuck it up.

We did get tipped for first, usually I think we are tipped for play off places but not first.

Yes, I think you're right.

My understanding (based on second-hand experience and here-say, so take with a pinch of salt) is that doctors administering a morphine drip to a terminally ill patient will show them how it works and explain to them that pressing the ""boost"" button more than X times will administer a lethal dose.  

They won't administer the fatal dose for you, but they won't try and stop you from doing it yourself.  I presume they're no more guilty of murder than the guy who sells someone a gun to blow their brains your, or the pharmacist who sells someone paracetamol to take an overdose.  It's perfectly legal for a doctor to administer a morphine drip for someone who's dying in pain.  If that person chooses to ""abuse"" it then that's up to them.

The problem in this case as I understand it is that he doesn't need morphine drip and the only reason for a doctor to administer one would be for the purpose of suicide.  I suspect that *would* make the doctor guilty of directly contributing to his death.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Just trying to imagine how devastated he must feel not being able to end his torment without the risk of someone he loves being prosecuted. It must be just devastating.

Although I have a great deal of sympathy for him, his situation is not quite as impossible as has been made out. I was struck by this quote from his wife during the interview Sky News broadcast:

&gt; ""We could do Switzerland but it’s very expensive and he doesn’t see why the hell he should have to go to a foreign country to die in the middle of an industrial estate""

Cost is not an issue in the slightest. The sum for the procedure could easily be raised amongst friends and family, let alone by soliciting donations from the public.

So it comes down to not wanting to end his life ""in the middle of an industrial estate""? But that's absurd. He can't at once argue both that his life is intolerable and that he will do anything to end it, and that he only wants to end his life in a particular kind of environment.

I get that his goal seems to be to force a change in the law so that others don't have to endure the same process he is going through, but ultimately he has options, he just doesn't want to take them.

Edit: Disregard this, apparently they couldn't do it in Switzerland regardless; from the court judgement:

&gt; As things are, the only way in which Tony could end his life  other than by selfstarvation would be by voluntary euthanasia.  With his wife’s help he could probably travel to Switzerland, but that would not help him because euthanasia is outside the scope of Dignitas’ activities.  No country in the world permits the practice of voluntary euthanasia in the case of non-residents.

Football is not a business to earn profit and it is a disgrace to their fans.

* Better support for SEN children in schools

* Better access to quality schooling

* Improved responses from public sector resources.

* Greater influence in the public domain

I think there is a difference. While it might not have been the great smashing of the class system which you eluded to in the industrial revolution the middle classes do have significantly more useful power that the working class.

Examples I can think of are schools with a strong middle class grouping in the governors and PTA who use their business links to provide the school with better resources and are capable of championing the school effectively to the local government. The fact that the middle class are more likely to be involved in politics, media and are generally more educated and articulate which allows them to persuade and influence.

The middle class tend to be more geographically dispersed allowing them to support family and friends over a larger distance allowing for easy movement between jobs and the ability to take intern positions.

The assets of the middle class also provide an informal line of credit within families which usually exceeds that of the working class which means that younger members of the family are buffered from the worst of financial situations.  A young adult who can rely on parental loans to get over a bad patch will be better off than one who has to resort to commercial lending. Likewise the tendency of many middle class families to give significant help on getting onto the property ladder has a long term impact on wealth.

However I should qualify that by stating that when I was with them they were pretty much a one-woman operation working out of what seemed to be Lynda's own living room. I notice that nowadays they have the whole 'office on Church Road which whiffs of hair gel and testosterone and a branded Mini Cooper' thing going on - so they're probably just as shit as everyone else.

As stated elsewhere I've been renting in Brighton/Hove for years and have watched as the letting agent game has become more and more absurd. 

Once upon a time there was a nominal (£40-£80) one-off agency charge per property. This swelled to around £150-£200 on average. Then it was £150-£200 per person. 

*What are these fees even for? They print out a copy of a standard contract and run a credit check on you - a check you can have done yourself for less than £20, so they must be getting them cheaper considering the volume? All their other overheads should be covered by the landlords - the people they are, after all, providing a service to.*

Deposits fluctuate from 6-8 weeks rent (although I appreciate the landlords may be the ones dictating this) and some of them try to charge a further 'admin fee' to place this deposit into a protection scheme (as required by law, with the legislation clearly stating that there should be no charge to tenants for using these). Then there is another 'admin fee' every six months for renewing (aka, doing fuck all) your contract; another £50-£100. If you really want to make your life unpleasant you can say you're happy to move on to a ""rolling"" contract rather than pay the fee, I had the manager of an agency call me and ask ""what's your problem?!?"" when I tried that one.

And then you move out of a place. First there is the anxiety as you wonder how they are going to try and skank your deposit - then when they do agree to return it to you there are the multiple phone calls and many weeks waiting before you get the cheque. Which they then post to you at your old address (happened once) or 'forget' to put a stamp on (twice). All the while your money is presumably sat in their bank account earning them a little interest.

And this is just the money side of things - trying to actually get anything fixed or have basic promises fulfilled, shit, I could write a book.

You presented yourself as someone who was heartbroken and who loved the club, and asked these people... who, last season, drained every ounce of emotion into a team who were completely screwed out of their deserved reward for excellence, and whose love for the shirt has never waned even at the clubs lowest points... to convince you to remain a fan! This reaction should have been expected... And you would have received the same reaction from **loyal supporters** of any club or American team, for that matter.

Point taken on Juve... But don't you see that's different? Like you said, they're crooks... They raped the honor of this game. Spurs are about the glory of the game and bring nothing but honor to it... And you're talking about bailing because we might not be one of the best four clubs in the league this season (even though I still think we will be)!!? That's why you're being told told to fuck off...

By all means, find a club that fits you... But if you don't want to experience heartbreak, your options are very limited, friend. Your best chance in the EPL is to start following Manchester United. But if you follow a club just because of the promise of silverware... You'll never really be a fan. As many others have said... Let the club choose you. The reward will be greater than any trophy (and trophies will be even sweeter still).

Lastly, I don't apologize for what I said. Perhaps your mistake in making this ""pretty important decision"" was not taking enough time to make the correct decision. Follow all the clubs you want if you aren't a **loyal fan**... But if you aren't a loyal fan, don't speak to actual loyal fans about your heartbreak. If you were truly heartbroken over last season, and are considering jumping ship because of it... Then yes, lack of character. And fuck off... You are an inferior fan. But, what it sounds like is that you aren't a loyal fan, and probably weren't truly heartbroken when Chelsea bumped us from the CL. If that's the case: poor choice of words, mate... We all would have toned it down a notch if you had admitted you were only a passive fan. Acting like a loyal fan who was willing to jump ship for any reason, and especially over potentially not making top four, is what earned you such a harsh reaction.

We all keep a grip on ourselves and everyone goes home to cry alone.  She was 36 and left a loving husband and a 4 year old son.  What the hell is wrong with this world ? So sorry about your mum, that must be hard to watch. 

What I actually wanted to say was this. It's a stupid analagy but it has the same logic.  I'm not expressing this well.

1. Arsenal are willing to pay a higher proportion of his wages while on loan. This has the least chance of hijacking the deal, since Sahin isn't reported to be on very high wages. If Liverpool wants him, it won't be too much financial strain as its only a year. 

2. Arsenal are open to a higher buyout clause. This is also unlikely since Madrid don't seem to want to sell him and Xabi Alonso rejected a contract extension. Still, a £15 million buyout clause is stupid to turn down.

3. Arsenal are ready to pay a higher loan fee on top of the wages. This has high chance of hijacking the deal. Liverpool are unlikely to pay a few million pounds for the privilege of loaning a player and paying his wages. Arsenal has money to burn after selling RVP and the potential sale of Alex Song. 

4. Arsenal are offering a first team place, possibly along with a playing time clause. This is a clause where they get a discount on the loan fee if they play Sahin for a minimum number of matches. This is the most likely, as Liverpool are building for the future and are unlikely to guarantee first team place for a loanee. 

In the end, there really isn't too much to worry about. Sahin was always going to be a loan deal that goes back to Madrid after a season. While he is a player with a lot of quality, he is hardly going to make a long term contribution to the club. I'll be very happy if he comes on loan, but I won't lose any sleep over it.

There are two questions that here:

*1st: Does the reduction of the vehicle speed from 30 to 20mph has any impact on the severity of the injuries?* The answer is absolutely and with a huge difference, e.g. the Swedish study (5) shows 5 times more fatalities with 30mph. **And this numbers do not count the avoided collisions due to the much smaller breaking distance**

*2nd: Does 20mph speed limit reduces the injuries and fatalities?* This is a bit different, because by just setting a new speed limit does not mean that drivers follow it. Also it may introduce other unknown factors, e.g. affect driver's alertness etc.
Both the BMJ study (1,2) and the Transport Report Laboratory study (3) produced conclusive results with reduction of injuries ranging from 41 to 60%

Regarding the cost, the proposed plan is to make 20mph the default speed limit for residential areas, which eliminates the need to explicitly state it in the beginning of each block. It will only require to signpost the main streets that will still have 30mph limit.

I don't have any evidence on the impact of slowing down to 20mph at residential streets. However considering that the proposal of 20mph speed limit will not affect the main streets, I don't think that for the sections of a journey that involve 20mph streets one can gain more than a minute or two in half an hour.",0,1345201028,null,0,false,0,c5uj2ls,t3_yd9sg,t1_c5uj2ls,t3_yd9sg,null,1429662499,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That may well be true, but it is not an argument to persuade, it is an argument to enrage those that already agree with you. 

For instance, they say that profitable services will be cherry picked, and that rich people will get a better service, and poor people worse. The Tories say, firstly, that profitable services will be subject to competition to drive prices down, to streamline services for greater efficiency, allowing better service for the same money, or the same service for less money. And secondly, that hospitals will use private patients to cross subsidize equipment for everyone, and that accepting this extra money into the system will improve services for everyone. So now you have two streams of rhetoric, being shouted out from both sides. What you need is for people to connect that rhetoric with reality, by arguing more tightly from the reality of the new structures, and from looking at comparisons with other countries.

If you see a person try to take an overdose or jump off a building then I'd guess you would desperately try and stop them. The person trying to commit suicide is then seen as being in an unsuitable frame of mind to make a decision whether they should live or die. The suicidal person will be kept in a hospital with no access to anything that could harm them i.e. their 'right' to commit suicide is taken away. 

I guess what I'm saying is if you take away a persons ability to kill themselves when they are completely able bodied but suicidal then you are showing they do not have a right to kill themselves. I don't think many people would want to change things so that a regular person who is suicidal is put in a situation where they can easily kill themselves.

From what Guardian? Y U not stating where the  author, Karin Olsson originally wrote this article? 

Ok click on the picture of the nice lady Karin Olsson, so it appeared in the *Expressen*, a Swedish tabloid. Bit inept of Guardian not to make it specifically clear, but nothing too underhand. So lets do a little digging

[This looks interesting](
http://rixstep.com/1/1/0/20111104,00.shtml)

&gt;Karin is known to her friends as 'Gottegrisen' - 'Candypig'. She particularly likes geléhallon sweets. And she particularly dislikes Julian Assange.

&gt;Karin has other dislikes too - this in accordance with her current position as 'culture editor' of Expressen. As Expressen is owned by the powerful Bonnier empire with tentacles in US and German publishing as well as the Swedish government (they have an ambassador in Tel Aviv and are staunchly zionist) and as the Bonniers have been Sweden's fiercest opponents of file sharing, Rick Falkvinge, and the Swedish Pirate Party, and as Julian Assange came to Stockholm a year ago to seal a deal with Rick's Pirate Party for WikiLeaks web server support, then WikiLeaks and Julian Assange must also of needs become an enemy as well and be attacked incessantly in their poison pen op-eds.

&gt;Given too that the Bonniers even own the German publishing house which released Daniel Domscheit-Berg's ridiculous book, and given that they hold the world rights to that 'adventure book' as it was called elsewhere in the Swedish media, then Karin Olsson must of course come out in full support of Daniel Domscheit-Berg's book. Done deal. Steady paycheque.

&gt;But Candypig went even further to please Humpty Dumpty. Speaking about a book that's otherwise universally laughed at, she used the opportunity to not only praise it but also to once again rail against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, stating there was a bad smell about the both and claiming it had to do with Julian's bathing habits.

&gt;Candypig has an irrepressible urge to lash out rudely at people, only thereafter to creep into her corner and claim innocence. She also has an extremely myopic view of what's going on in her country. And finally she has an agenda handed to her by her editor: destroy file sharing, Rick Falkvinge, the Pirate Party, and WikiLeaks. The Bonnier empire with its investments in Popular Mechanics, Swedish cinemas, book of the month clubs and Swedish publishing in general: they can't risk someone getting one of their fine products for free. And as WikiLeaks might accidentally expose some of their high stakes political intrigues, they can't tolerate WikiLeaks either.

So Guardian, you have republished a piece on Assange written in a Swedish tabloid by a writer whose job it is to slate Assange. Seriously WTH is going on with the Guardian these days? 

None of the papers are carrying anything about Claes Borgström, the lawyer representing the two women, how is is a politician desperate to gain power by smearing Assange, and how useless and corrupt he is after the Thomas Quick fiasco.

To get to the US from Sweden, the UK has to explicitly say that it is allowed as part of the European Arrest Warrant and therefore it will have to go to through UK courts as well as Swedish courts if they want to extradite him to the US.  If anything it is more difficult to extradite him to the US from Sweden because of the extra layers of court.

Personally I think the best option for all of us is to hope that he goes to Sweden and if he is then officially charged (which seems certain) he will have to answer a case in front of a jury of his peers.

Assange unfortunately is more than likely being used as a pawn in this game of global politics and that is not good, but this nonsense about being a puppet of the USA drives me round the bend. 

TL;DR - there is a bigger picture. 

(I understand this is probably an unpopular view but you believe what you choose to.)

true,makeinstall,null,null,"I've been pretty much on the fence about the whole thing for various reasons but I have to refute some of your statements:

A) It is defined as rape. If you read the judgement of [Assange vs Swedish Prosecution Authority](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.html), in section 3 of the introduction, it lays out 4 offences:

&gt;*""1. Unlawful coercion  
On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm. Assange, by using violence. forced the injured party to endure his restricting her freedom of movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party's arms and a forceful spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight preventing her from moving or shifting.*  

&gt;*2. Sexual molestation  
On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity. Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her without her knowledge.*  

&gt;*3. Sexual molestation  
On 18 August 2010 or on any of the days before or after that date, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his naked, erect penis to her body.*  

&gt;*4. Rape  
On 17 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [SW] in Enkoping, Assange deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep. was in a helpless state.
It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange. who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used. still consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate the injured party's sexual integrity.""*  

***Unlawful coercion*** and ***rape*** are pretty well defined and documented there.

&gt;*B) The real reason Sweden wants Assange is more than likely down to the USA.*

Why not just call for him to be extradited from the UK? Considering your next comment, it shows the tinfoil hat bizarreness of Assange supporters:

&gt;*As a side note, I do believe the USA is pressuring Sweden to get him as Swedens extradition laws are less stringent than the UK's and more favourable to the USA.*

Er....what?

The UK has rolled over and handed the US authorities several British subjects where there was less evidence, and in the case of Richard O'Dwyer, not equivalent crime in the UK.

As members of the EU and signatories of the ECHR, neither the UK nor Sweden can hand over Assange if he possibly faces the death penalty, another of the claims that his supporters make.

Personally, I think he is an odious person who wanted his face to be splashed everywhere in some bizarre act of matyrdom, which has done nothing but detract from the cause of Wikileaks.

&gt;A novel form of anthrax has recently been recognised. Between December 2009 and December 2010, drug users in Scotland, England and Germany were found to have acquired anthrax through using heroin contaminated with anthrax spores (Ramsay et al 2010). Users were frequently but not exclusively been injectors (Booth et al 2010). Follow the link for the latest information in England and links to information in Scotland.

&gt;This type of anthrax had only reported once before, in Norway in 2000. Cases in the UK have presented in a variety of ways:

&gt;Severe soft tissue infection, including necrotizing fascitis and cellulitis/ abscess, particularly if associated with oedema which is often marked. Compartment syndrome has also been noted.
Signs of severe sepsis, with or without evidence of soft tissue infection.
Meningitis (especially haemorrhagic meningitis) including clinical and/or CT evidence suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracranial bleed.

&gt;Gastrointestinal symptoms - abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, GI haemorrhage.

-Personally, I dislike having to resort to using a red card. I'd much rather deliver the package and save you the hassle of either organising re-delivery, or going to the depot for it. If I don't deliver it, then I've got to carry it with me till I get back to the van, thus extra weight I'm lumbered with.

-Unless you live in a noise free zone and spend all your time sitting by your door, then it's entirely possible that you'll miss your doorbell or the sound of someone knocking at your door. I've missed plenty of deliveries myself simply by popping into the garden briefly.

-Following that note, check to see if your doorbell works (sounds silly, but I've had people ask if I rang the bell, then tested it in front of me, only to find that the batteries had died in it).

-Delivering to neighbours isn't a bad idea, but if you don't want it to happen then give us an alternative. I've seen quite a few outdoor safe boxes (they get shut and locked once we drop off the package) that customers had installed, and they're a great idea if you get regular deliveries and are likely to be out.

&gt;How to eat peas

&gt;To be very polite, peas should be crushed onto the fork - a fork with the prongs pointing down. The best way is to have load the fork with something to which they will stick, such as potato or a soft vegetable that squashes easily onto the fork. It's sometimes easier to put down your knife and then switch your fork to the other hand, so you can shovel the peas against something else on the plate, thus ensuring they end up on your fork.

&gt;The fork should not be used as a scoop but held so that the points of the tines face down",0,1345213299,null,0,false,0,c5ukvo7,t3_yblvx,t1_c5ukvo7,t1_c5ukhu5,null,1429663418,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;This article is utter nonsense and the figures are meaningless. They are meaningless because you are trying to measure the last placed country in events using a tiny subset of countries who actually compete and then qualified for those events. These teams are not last placed at 100m or football; many teams failed to even qualify for such events so in order to measure this in meaningful terms you would need to measure that. In addition, the host team gets a free entry into everything so inevitably ends up losing a lot of events - this was true of many many previous hosts and completely confounds your measurements - as a scientist you should know better. What you are really measuring is far less interesting; you are measuring the top 10 or so countries in each event and working out which is the 10th placed team in the world. How fascinating. I hope you were paid a great deal of money by the WSJ for this work.

&gt;Perhaps most importantly, I question your motive for writing this article. The last paragraph about the 'little guys' having a chance to win 'loser' medals is just offensive and smacks of arrogance, ignorance and colonialism.

true,[deleted],null,null,"We had options. 'arry and Levy just chose to, for whatever reason, loan them out and not utilize them at all. Townsend is a bit raw, but Pienaar was more than capable of being played on the wing effectively as a second option, and from what I've heard from various Swansea fans, Gylfi is capable of playing on the right as well. Levy's been haggling and clearly not willing to spend the extra 5m on a player, so what I meant by that wasn't time-wise, I meant financially. I've said all along that our biggest concerns this window were 1. a striker, 2. a center back (Jan plugged that hole nicely), 3. a new CM in case Modric leaves, 4. a new winger to compete with Lennon/provide cover, and 5. a younger goalkeeper, in descending order of urgency (honestly speaking, 5 would just be a luxury, I trust Brad). But at this point, one day before the season starts, we still haven't managed to figure out the single most obvious hole in the squad. I was hoping it would be Hoilett but for whatever reason Levy didn't jump all over that. Perhaps AVB didn't rate him, who knows, but we've already passed up a lot of targets this summer and it's frustrating. I think Kane has potential, but if we only have Defoe/Kane as our strikers and Bale/Lennon/Bentley/Townsend as our wingers to start the season, we are infinitely more fucked if Defoe goes down than if Lennon does.

As far as whether they offered more or whatever, I'd speculate that it had to do mostly with playtime. He wouldn't be guaranteed a starting position here whereas at Southampton he'd be the star and most likely have his choice of teams to go to in a year or two.

I don't think you can think of oneself a student of Wikileaks or the Assange case and be good enough to correct general misconceptions, yet not not be familiar with [10-GJ-3793](http://www.alexaobrien.com/secondsight/wikileaks/grand_jury/legal_dockets_a/wikileaks_grand_jury_legal_dockets_and_files_subpoena_unnamed_cambridge_resident.html). The FBI are carrying out criminal investigations into Wikileaks this has been admitted in the recent Bradley Manning court proceedings. If you want to understand what real forensic journalism entails read [this blog topic](
http://www.alexaobrien.com/secondsight/wikileaks/grand_jury/
).

I don't see anywhere on your blog a detailed deconstruction of the [translated police documents](http://rixstep.com/1/20110204,04.shtml). That could be one large misconception:

&gt; [Anna rang A and updated her because she herself **hadn't planned on filing a complaint against Julian** but she wanted to support the other girl.](http://rixstep.com/1/20110202,00.shtml)

Plus Ramirez is hardly likely to be a poor investment. Besides, the fact we've bid at the level we reportedly did (for Ramirez, and M'Vila, not to mention Lloris) shows money isn't the issue.

I suppose I just disagree on your ordering of our transfer priorities - I put wing cover well ahead of another centre mid, especially with Gylfi having signed. I just hope this means we have someone AVB considers better in mind instead - at least we know they're looking at people in this position I guess.

true,Difficult-E,flair8,,"I wasn't bred a fan. I'm an American. But, I love Tottenham Hotspur as much as any team I've followed my whole life. The reason being: I love them for the right reasons... The same reasons I love the other teams I support.

Things are a bit chippy here, so allow me to de-escalate things a touch; we are all emotional because of the way things are going and your post seemed insensitive... But that was because of your wording. I don't apologize for my reaction but, considering this new information, I'll rephrase my response: if you are questioning your loyalty, then this isn't the club for you... Perhaps you tried a little to hard to find your club and didn't allow it to happen naturally. I suggest you give it more time...

As an American, I found my heart was in it when I stopped just watching matches and decided to learn about the clubs I was watching. The way Spurs played the game was breathtaking. It was also fun watching Man U and Arsenal... But it was the story about how we called ourselves ""yids"" to diffuse the anti-semitism that was rampant in London at the time... About how the founders named the club after ""Harry Hotspur"" from Shakespeare's Henry IV (the real life Henry Percy whose family were landowners in Tottenham)... About the shady circumstances of Arsenal's promotion to the top flight over us... And on the pitch, we were the only non-league club to win the FA cup, we were the first English club to win a European trophy, and the first club of the 20th century to win the League/FA cup double... All of this seemed like magic to me, but reading about the history of other clubs (even though sometimes equally or more impressive), it never felt magical.

I hope that is more constructive feedback. I hate to lose a fellow yid, especially an American... But,if you aren't really into it, then it's probably for the best. Good luck finding your club. I hope you realize this club means something to you.

(typed on my phone... I hope there aren't massive errors)

**EDIT:** I've had a chance to get to a desktop, and I'd like to add something. The end of last season was a disaster. I attribute it to 'Arry's flirtation with the England position and especially because of fatigue to our star players because 'Arry NEVER rotated the squad. I am disappointed in them, but I don't think they literally quit on the season... It's just a whole lot caught up to them all of a sudden, and once the adrenaline wore off we were just a shell of what we were capable of. And, please, keep in mind... The reason you were told to fuck off was because you said **""remain a loyal fan""** and talked about heartbreak... in a post asking for help not to jump ship. If you had said you were a casual fan wanting our insight into why it was worth it to stick with us, I don't think the response would have been so severe.

Also true: and a veritable scandal.  Despicable.  However, that was over a decade ago.  Somebody pointed out that it would be a bit like blaming the current government for the Iraq debacle and claiming that they'd therefore go and invade an embassy or som... ok, poor example.

Sweden also have a history of refusing to extradite known CIA traitors wanted for charges of espionage.  There really is no doubt that Edward Lee Howard (see link on the blog post) was guilty of such, and Sweden popped him on a plane to Moscow, on the grounds that espionage is a political crime.

I have been unable to determine if this is still the policy, but it is worth noting that Mr Assange went to Sweden precisely to take advantage of their whistleblower laws.

You do have to pay a dividend tax as well (10% on anything below £35k, 32.5% on anything up to £150k and 42.5% on everything over £150k).  Plus the corporation tax that you had to pay (which is probably minimal at the amounts we're talking about).  Really the main benefit you get is the ability to claim back VAT on expenses.

What I hated about this article is the assertion that Civil Servants are complaining.  These are not Civil Servants, these are paid contractors.  What is worse is that the Government isn't insisting that when whole areas are outsourced that these organisations and the people working for them don't have to declare their tax returns.

I like Moses too, but it's a little questionable how effective he'd be as competition for Lennon - he largely played up the left of Wigan's 433, and as we've seen with Bale quality on one side doesn't necessarily translate across the pitch. Same issue with Hoilett. Had quite enough of qualitipy left mids going to waste in the Spurs squad...

I'd take Moses anyway because he can play centrally - having watched him I'd guess he would be good right across the front line, but that's hardly nailed on so I wouldn't want to rely on it. I'd sign him as a versatile back up striker in addition to someone like Johnson or Dzagoev for out wide if it were possible.

I hope you're wrong about AVB not being keen on Huddlestone - I think his lack of minutes in preseason is just the club being delicate with a player who's been injured for a long time. The idea he's not useful without the ball is a bit backwards to be honest - he's no Sandro but the guy's played at CB quite a bit, his defensive positioning is good. If his mobility continues to improve as it did over the year before his injury he'll be even better.

I encourage criticism, the finding of error (I am happy to correct them) and suggestions for things to cover.  Thank you for your input!

I have explained why I started, and what I have covered in [this post](http://amiobjective.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/my-position-on-wikileaks-detailed-and.html), and I also said there:

&gt; I have also noted concerns about the EAW and possible abuses of it for other purposes, which I would like to explore further at some point.  I would very much like to blog about these things, but thus far I have been caught up in the sheer volume of bad information coming from Wikileaks and their supporters

You missed some, by the way: the name of Mr Assange was leaked to the press.  The interviews were leaked to the press. Ny was criticised by the High Court judge for having made inaccurate (or ambiguous) statements to the press, especially around questioning and charges (a complex difference between here and Sweden).

These are concerning, as is the link between Borgström and the government official who was Justice minister at the time of the rendition flight (they work at the same firm) which I covered briefly [here](http://amiobjective.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/analysis-2012-06-20-swedish-extradition.html) as part of a larger analysis.

Also the false (but widely spread) claim that Mr Assange admitted via his lawyer that the accusations were factually true but disputed that they were rape (covered on the blog post I linked to).

All of these do indeed require scrutiny.  I haven't managed to cover them yet.  I basically started because lots of media types were getting almost everything wrong (recent ""4 corners"" documentary by ABC in Australia for example.

The untruths which were spreading furthest fastest ([not least](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/statuses/235362077668163584) because Wikileaks [actively](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/206320547615883264) promote [them](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/statuses/206780352344227841)) are what I first set out to tackle.

There is plenty of criticism already around about the prosecution; maybe my coverage shows a lack of balance - that is a fair accusation I think.  But it's because the balance in general is so weighted in favour of Mr Assange and against the Swedish justice system.",0,1345221772,null,0,false,0,c5un02a,t3_ydjci,t1_c5un02a,t1_c5um9to,null,1429664426,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We'll have to agree to disagree on Ramirez. He's a good player--not saying he's shit or anything--but I just don't see our need for him. He could develop into more of a wide player but at the moment his preferred position is definitely centrally. I wouldn't have been broken up if we signed him but I think if we're looking for wide depth and competition we can get a lot better value. 

As for Huddlestone, I hope I'm wrong too but he doesn't really play a good pressing game which is what AVB wants from his midfielders. If we play a 4-3-3 I think Huddlestone would be very useful but with a deep 2 I can see him being exposed. I don't think his positioning is as good as you suggest.

That's not even talking about what he does WITH the ball, of course. He can pick a pass, there's no denying that, but sometimes he has Charlie Adam syndrome where he fails to keep it simple. Even a successful 50 yard diagonal can be kind of useless, especially when we no longer spam balls into the box like we did with Crouchy.

I just think our play has evolved from getting it to the wings as fast as possible.

I am the son of a paralysed man.  My mother is disabled.  My brother is disabled.  I am disabled.  My first wife was deaf.  My friends are mostly deaf, blind, paralysed, or some combination thereof.

My parents' friends were all disabled, some paralysed.  I have spent more hours in hospitals in my 35 years than most surgeons will in their entire careers, and that is not hyperbole.

When in undergrad I did a few ""tours of duty"" with the local head trauma centre's rehabilitation group.  I must've told people with very, very severe problems (some unable to move more than their cheeks/eyes) that I could not help them die at least a dozen times.

There are other people who face similar-level emotional trauma from other sources.  I have a dear friend who became deaf and blind, totally, following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.  The decline in her senses was rapid and irreversible; from the time she went to the doctor until she was completely deaf-blind was about 3 months.  She wanted to die while it was happening.  She wanted to die after it happened.  She was living in terror.  She was completely closed off from the world.  

Now she teaches people Braille and edits some news letters, writes articles, etc.  She's very active, married, and quite happy.  She trains her own service dogs.  She can train a new service (assistance) dog in about 3 months.  Most programs take 2-3 years at the minimum to train a service dog.  Note that many counties' governments think *so little* of the disabled that it is *illegal* to owner-train a service dog.

I believe that people who want to help the severely disabled to die are unconsciously undervaluing the very people they are hoping to help.  I know they are underestimating how capable these people typically are.  (Certainly there are very extreme cases, and they are difficult, but the technologies that will allow these people to directly interact with the world - speak, use robotic limbs, etc - is all in active development as we speak.  Many technologies already exist that help them to interact with the world and live productive lives.)

I believe strongly that assisting the suicide of a disabled person is unethical because I am ""fucking crazy"" enough to love severely disabled people, live with them, help them and be helped by them, and actually understand and live their challenges longer than the time it takes to read a sad article and write a few sentences of self-righteous disgust.",0,1345222396,null,0,false,0,c5un68i,t3_ycgun,t1_c5un68i,t1_c5umk6g,null,1429664528,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"Time is in a state of flux. There are some events that will have already taken place, and others that won't have happened until they actually ""happen"".

For example, the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire was *supposed* to be occurring by the year 200,000, however interference from the Daleks had stunted the growth of the human race, so in the timeline in which the Ninth Doctor arrived at Satellite 5, the empire never took place.

There are fluctuating points that have ""already happened"" that can unhappen, then there are also fixed points that always happen (occasionally with the most minor changes, *See: Bowie Base One*)

One such fixed point was [spoiler](#s ""The Doctor's apparent death in Utah, April 22nd 2011""). This was a known occurence to the Teselecta, for instance, however the Doctor himself was unaware of it originally, due to simply not having come into contact with anything that mentioned it.

In answer to your first sentence, it's a mixture of both. Actions in different points in time have an effect on the rest of the timeline, which create alternate timelines, while interference with one's own timeline can create a very troublesome paradox.

One example of a paradox is Rose saving her father in *Father's Day*. Her past included the fact that her father died, so saving him would've had an effect on her own history and perhaps simply created a slightly alternate Rose who grew up along with her father. However, the reason the Reapers appeared is because she and the Doctor had *already* been there, and Rose's actions the second time were observed by their first selves, and time was weakened at that point.

There's nothing really stopping multiple incarnations of the Doctor running into each other except the fact that they simply try and avoid going to the same place at the same time.

* From Folkstone, head west along the A259, take in Dymchurch, Camber sands, Rye and Hastings.

* Then get on the A27 and head for Brighton.  I'd spend the night in Brighton - lots of B&amp;B (Bed and Breakfast) places and a great nightlife.

* From Brighton, keep going west on the A27, through Chichester (maybe stop for a snack and look around) and onto Portsmouth.  Gunwharf Keys and the [Historic Dockyard](http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/) are worth a look if ships are your thing.  

* From Portsmouth, take the M27 towards Southampton (bypass Southampton altogether - bit of a shit hole) then the M3 north to Winchester.  Check out the cathedral if you like architecture.

* From Winchester, A34 north to meet to A303, then west through Andover and onto Amesbury (Stonehenge)

She is from New Zealand, Aus, or there abouts if we do a little math with the time zones. I believe she is a she because (she is far too polite) and her tweets revolve almost exclusively around feminism, the rape issue, Pussy Riots, that sort of thing. And there is nothing wrong with that but as she says *'of all the subreddits I found, this one looked the most likely'*, so she is not an objectivist, she is an activist, deliberately propagating an agenda.

This idea is explicit when you read her twitter feed.

This is the problem when people talk about football. Some people think internationals are the pinnacle of the game. They are wrong. Steven Gerrard literally does care more about Liverpool than England. Players don't see winning the World Cup as the ultimate goal. They see the Champions League.

Frankly people don't care about what the Olympians have done. They have hit the peak of their sport themselves. It isn't their fault people mistake internationals as that. Any of the big 4, Barcelona or Real Madrid would waltz through the WC without even breaking a sweat. Barcelona are a much better team than Spain. United would put 5 past England.

Hence, the formal declaration has to be delivered, signed by the Monarch and with his/her seal on it to the locations for the local official to make the Proclamation.

It is still a formal requirement, although the UK hasn't formally declared war since WW2.

1) Yep! It was implied that the Cyberman was working wirelessly with the separate components of its boy (hence why it was able to re-attach its own head). Certainly not a bad idea when the locals you are guarding the Pandorica against only have blunt weapons (i.e., not guns).

2) This one is to provide the twist in the tale (not terribly well executed, in my opinion). Normally the Doctor faces all these enemies of his alone - one race at a time, and if they do encounter each other (like the Daleks and Cybermen), they usually start attacking the other - and not the Doctor. So because of this, the Doctor assumes they all came on their own initiative and not because they are allied to each other. His big speech at Stonehenge really emphasises this, because he suggests that they all wait for another race to try first before going after the Pandorica.

3) Again, this is a twist to allow the Angels to evolve as monsters (that is to say, add an extra aspect to their being that makes them scarier). So it's established that you have to watch Angels to stay alive, but what if watching them is now a danger? So the Angels can now use the visual memory centre in your brain (and your energy - which they feed off), to become tangible. Not too difficult to swallow because they're not technically tangible when not being looked at.

4) The Angels in Blink didn't always cover their eyes, they uncovered when they found prey.

5) Yep! The Doctor and Churchill are old friends - the TARDIS is able to hijack those calling the Doctor and funnel the calls through the Time Vortex to the appropriate moment for the Doctor.

6) The Doctor knew that Vincent only had a couple of months before his suicide, and also knew that depression is not an illness that can be fixed with a wave of his hand. He knew that it wouldn't alter Vincent taking his own life, but by showing Vincent what he would achieve after his death, it was ""adding to his pile of good things"". And the Doctor is *always* messing with Time, he just knew that it wouldn't do any serious changes.

The article is simply wrong both materially (see previous paragraph), but also in intent - the ""three times the rate of wage inflation"" is averaged over ten years - but in those ten years the first five raced ahead significantly more than ""three times"", then fell back.  It's not really a trend, yet it's pretending it is.

Not that house prices aren't too expensive, as they quite blatantly are.

Umm.. do you mean tips for moving out, or tips for living off campus, or tips for living away from home??

I guess you mean tips for living off campus:

* Give yourself plenty of time to get to campus, one time I didn't do this and it happened to be the day the Queen visited Exeter and the roads were closed, even to pedestrians. I was extremely late.

* Buy food in bulk as it's cheaper and try not to eat too much meat as that's the most expensive food by far. Take food into campus if possible as the food sold on campus is usually overpriced.

* Wash all your stuff up because jesus christ that's irritating

Can't really think of anything else, try and think of more specific questions :P

I'm sure we'll get the usual right-on-man crowd in to tell us we're all terrible racists for not liking the way travelers are of another race, but fuck it. They ruin so many things and not once have I had a good experience that involved a traveler.  Once I was innocently glaring at a pack of them, and not one of them tugged their forlock to me.

Trouble is, what most people don't realise is that the real problem in this once Green and Pleasant land isn't corporations taking over public space; or the destruction of the NHS; or that my son's gone gay all of a sudden.

We are on the brink of recovery.  Things haven't looked better for Margate in a decade, or more.  The proposed Tesco will be twice the size of a football pitch, 24 hour, ruin our seafront, they've just built one 5 minutes walk away, they lied so much in the proceedings that it was scheduled for public enquiry in Feb and HMGov said they had to pay our costs, whatever the outcome due to the irregularities.  

For goodness sake they LIED about the height of it.  We are just about to embark upon the rebuilding of dreamland.  Have you seen what it will look like with the HUGE shed there ?  The traffic survey saying the infrastructure could cope was done in winter and before the Turner was built.  There's no way it would cope.  It will take ages to get in and out of Margate.  It will basically be like the traffic at Westwood - probably done by the same incompetent. I think [this](http://i.imgur.com/8PSQ0.jpg) is the picture in which they drew the building considerably smaller than it would actually be.  

Furthermore they have absolutely no interest in helping to renovate Darlingon Heights and the residents are expected to pay up for Tesco's benefit whilst losing half their car park and enduring 24 hour lorry deliveries (which will be louder at the top than at the bottom).  I attended some planning committee meetings and it was like something out of Private Eye's Rotten Boroughs section.  Still we've heard nothing from them since Feb and there's a rumour that they are going to content themselves with a small one in the old mobility shop.  That's fine, but don't mess with our Town just as things are improving.",0,1345238878,null,0,1346916177,0,c5urop8,t3_ydykb,t1_c5urop8,t1_c5uq4kc,null,1429666627,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've realised that Warnock has actually been playing a 4-4-1-1 formation, like Hodgson did with England in Euro '12, which is interesting to see.

However, if we start like we did against Shrewsbury, we'll get absolutely **mullered**. We need to start on the front foot and pass like we did in the 2nd half of that game: Warnock's teams always look so much better when they play the ball on the floor, funnily enough.

There is VERY LITTLE bias on /r/soccer from what I have seen. If you post on /r/soccer and get downvoted into oblivion, it isn't because you have a Liverpool crest, it's because your comment was horribly biased or fucking retarded. Mmkay?

Also, Man U isn't even the most popular crest (it's Arsenal I'm pretty sure). It isn't a Man U shitfest. The good comments rise to the top and the bad comments sink into nothingness. /r/soccer is a pretty decent community, especially considering the intense rivalries and hatred between clubs, and the only people being immature about it are the people going to their club's subreddit (it happens in a lot of subs, I've seen it) and posting a gif or meme about how everyone on /r/soccer hates their club, and it gets upvoted by everyone because they want to feel like they're hard done by all the time and that *they're* the underdog. NO. If you leave a good comment on /r/soccer wearing whatever fucking crest - it will get upvoted or, if it doesn't get noticed, stay neutral. RARELY DOES ANYONE FUCKING DOWNVOTE YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR CREST, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING A BIASED RETARD.

true,TragedyTrousers,tardis,TARDIS,"Hmm, I sense we are about to head east and west, and ne'er the twain shall meet.  

To pick one of your examples at random, the Weeping Angels were *very* different in their second appearance, as if they were entirely different beasties.  On a writing level (and it was the same writer for both) it makes perfect sense to do this, as it simply wouldn't have been very interesting to revisit these creatures if they were exactly the same as last time.  In the show, wherever their new behaviour was exhibited, there was always a line or two to explain it, but many found these lines too glib and insubstantial for such radical changes: not me.  For me, these lines were a way of winking at the audience in exactly the Basil Exposition way outlined above, and saying ""yes, we're changing the rules, try and keep up, don't worry about it too much, and just enjoy the ride"".  

Again, for some this is unsatisfying, and I can understand where they're coming from, but for me, the Series 5 Angels two-parter is a simply sublime bit of seat-of-the-pants screaming-out-loud drama that I rewatch often, and find satisfyingly brilliant every time.  

I hope I don't sound condescending when I say I'm truly sorry for those who aren't able to enjoy it in the same way due to their annoyances about the changes in the 'rules', but I mean it without being patronising.

For my part, I found the endings of previous series to be lazy and grating after a while, and was immensely glad when Series 5 at least *tried* to make the endings make sense without cop-outs and reset buttons going off repeatedly (I love the way Series 5's ending actually *parodied* the reset button finale).  

There was never anything as egregiously silly here as in, say, the Last of the Time Lords, where everyone saying the Doctor's name at once would reverse ~~the polarity of the neutron flow~~ D&amp;D magic spell The Master had cast, and conjure up Doctor-Jesus to fix everything with a wave of his hand.  

I felt a lot of the earlier shows were resolved like some manic card trading game, with people slapping down random magic power trumps at random, til everything got too much and the reset button was hit just in time for yet more Rose related melodrama.

Having said all that, much to my annoyance, Series 5 continued with a couple of shows using the ending where characters 'think thoughts of love *reeeally* hard and it'll make the bad guys go away' drivel that no self-respecting writer should ever use, but hey, there's no such thing as a perfect Series of Doctor Who...

It's an extremely delicate area both morally and legally, not something you can just cobble together in a bill and force through the Lords. I do believe the High Courts ruling is one legal stepping stone towards some kind of euthanasia bill but there is still the huge hurdle of working with the medical profession to understand how euthanasia would fit in with current medical practices. Not to mention the process of making a system where all the parties involved are legally protected when performing euthanasia and that there is a system that makes sure the person really wants to die. I think those and more factors are more of an issue than religious pressure. 

A BSA (British Social Attitudes) survey in 2010 that [71%](http://www.dignityindying.org.uk/research/opinion.html) religious people agreed that a doctor should probably or definitely be allowed to end the life of a patient with a painful incurable disease at the patient's request.

And, honestly, I wouldn't suggest asking people on reddit to create a tattoo for you. Find a tattoo artist by looking at their work online or in a shop, and work with them on it. You don't want someone to just transfer someone else's work onto you - every artist has their own style and flair, and a tattoo will look best coming from the artist who created it. 

Look for images online to help out your artist conceptualize your idea though!

To be more specific on this point, it's generally held that the courts cannot generally create completely new laws (although in certain common law areas, of which this is not one, they have). Instead they can only apply old laws and find new meanings in existing law. 

In this case all the precedent goes against the existence of a right to die and there are no existing laws which can reasonably be interpreted to include a right to die. To hold that one exists would involve the judiciary taking upon themselves parliamentary-esque law-making powers, going against all constitutional conventions and probably causing a constitutional crisis.

I dunno, I'm not sure we should elevate any 'athlete' to be the zenith of humanity, even physically, let alone morally, emotionally, or on intellectual merit which is what 'role model' culture seems to aspire to.

If anything, I think the fucking stupid, fucking scumbag, fucking vultures are the snapping lenses and tapping fingers of a media machine that elevates people to inhuman statuses and the feasts on the fallen bodies when they drop...

That's not a defence of the stupid fucking shit footballers have done and have said in the public sphere, they are fucking stupid.

I get what you are saying here and I agree to an extend.  I guess that in certain cases I didn't mind this as much and was just thrown off a bit when they 'changed the rules', as you said.


&gt; There was never anything as egregiously silly here as in, say, the Last of the Time Lords, where everyone saying the Doctor's name at once would reverse the polarity of the neutron flow D&amp;D magic spell The Master had cast, and conjure up Doctor-Jesus to fix everything with a wave of his hand.

Yeah, I definitely agree with that one.  It actually bugs me more than any of the bullet points I listed.  Another example of something that bothered me in previous series' was they way that they brought Rose back into the story line - she left as a naive girl infatuated with the Doctor and somehow turned into the Terminator in just a few short years - and got the Doctor shot to boot.


&gt; I hope I don't sound condescending when I say I'm truly sorry for those who aren't able to enjoy it in the same way due to their annoyances about the changes in the 'rules', but I mean it without being patronising.

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"I agree that there's been some sloppy writing on the show, and I've been critical of Moffat for it...but honestly, the Doctor describing himself as ""a complicated space-time event"" is actually a pretty good piece of writing and really does mean something.  It's not just doubletalk or gibberish.  

A event in space-time is the term in mathematical physics for an occurrence that takes place in a defined area of space over a defined period of time.  You know where it happened, when it began, and when it finished; it's an event.  Every person could be described as a unique space-time event: we occupy space, we have a starting point and an end point.   

We're fairly simple as events: we're limited to the surface of this one planet, and our starting point goes in a straight line to our end point, typically less than 100 years away.  We don't have a TARDIS.  The way I put it in an earlier comment was that if a regular person's space-time event is a straight line, human time travelers like Jack Harkness or River Song would be a plate of spaghetti...and because of how widely he travels and how long he does it, the Doctor would be [the world's biggest ball of twine](http://www.travelingkings.com/?attachment_id=124).

So: that's how the Doctor is a complicated space-time event.

true,BritishHobo,welsh,Wales,"&gt;Oh shut up. Anywhere you go on Reddit it's full of ""USA USA"" and ""Fuck yeah, merica"" quotes. This is the once place we can go to speak with other Brits without the fucking Americans getting in the way. What about Anti-Rest of the fucking world from the Americans? They think they are fucking Gods gift to the world and that they are better than everyone else.

Ah, such bullshit. If this was just a place to get away from America, what's with all the vitriol about the place? God, even your comment, which is supposed to be trying to disprove my argument about anti-American sentiment in here, is massively antagonistic and childish about America. On top of that, if you think Reddit is filled with people talking about how America is the best, you can't be looking at the front page much. There's constant bitching from Americans about their government, their police, their schools, their citizens, their security, their movie studios, their copyright laws, their laws in general. I think all the /r/UK comments of 'OH THERE'S JUST 'FUCK YEAH 'MERICA' COMMENTS *EVERYWHERE*' are an exaggerated excuse to bash a strawman. You're more likely to see an American on here bash the 'FUCK YEAH 'MERICA' stereotype than you are to see one buy into it.

As the other person pointed out, my post came before the Olympics, when everyone was being massively cynical about every aspect of the Olympics, and talking about how it was all going to be shit and horrible. Funny how quickly all the bitching about the security/corporate sponsors/copyrights/cycle lanes etc was forgotten.

Gain me some fucking internet friends. Heh. Man, I have 'British' in my name. Hardly shows me up as somebody who's just here to bash Britain.

We recently had an abortion scandal where doctors happily conducted sex-selective abortions, and more commonly circumvented safe guards that exist to prevent abuse of abortion law.

If they didn't respect the assisted-suicide safe guards, then its only a matter of time before someone misses out on a treatment option, counselling session, or diagnosis that could save their life.

At the minute I don't really trust parliament or the government to ensure safe guards are stringent and well policed.

1. It is the duty of the state to help the people within it to live their lives as they choose, providing those choices don't impinge upon or directly harm others.

1. It can be regulated by ensuring that the individual concerned instigates the procedure themselves and that their consent is voluntary and fully informed; e.g. by having them apply and then be interviewed and assessed by a number of independent medical, legal, and psychological professionals over a suitable period of time.

Surely their moral code is far less abitrary that the /r/unitedkingdom consensus which is a mixture of socialist/leftist economic policy, and liberal social policy. Which takes far more bending of the mind than simply saying ""Life should be preserved in general, and not destroyed for the convenience of other humans"" which as a *general* rule is far less arbitrary.

At worst its not more ""Arbitrary"" than any other moral code. I feel like you've just thrown in the word arbitrary for no reason. Is that word really accurate?

&gt;providing those choices don't impinge upon or directly harm others.

I agree, but the issue of institutionalised suicide could lead to much greater harm upon those who currently do not have to deal with it. These people are the majority as greedy relatives wanting inheritance pressuring grannies are in no short supply.

&gt;then be interviewed and assessed by a number of independent medical, legal, and psychological professionals over a suitable period of time.

&gt; Why are pro lifers considered the bane of modern society? Most of them are good people who simply see death as something that should not be endorsed by the state. Pro-lifers are also against the death penalty and other nasties.

Because the idea of having a right to die is considered to be a good thing, especially in cases such as Tony Nicklinsons where the guy should clearly be put out of his misery. And quite often pro-lifers don't seem to have the interests of people like this in mind when debating their side of the argument. So from a purely emotional point of view they are seen as being cold hearted bastards.

&gt; Is it morally right/safe for us as a society of individuals, to have the state fully endorse choice suicide? What about people with depression? What if people are totally sane but are old and feeble, being pressured by greedy family members?

Morally I'd say yes. But morals aren't actually real, they are just how people feel so they are the subject of debate. In cases such as Nicklinsons why keep him alive? His life is clearly an unending nightmare he no longer wants, and I don't see what benefit society gains from his continued endurance of this. But, you do raise good points. There needs to be a system in place to prevent the right to die from being abused, as people will do just this. So until we do this, I'd say that the only way it could be done is via a case by case basis with the home secretary having the ultimate say. However, I'm not entirely sure how compatible this is with our legal system.

&gt; How can this possibly be regulated so that the gov't/NHS doesn't kill people off to save costs. We have already seen some shocking examples of cost cutting! How can we afford the colossal amounts of bureaucracy this will involve?

You have to compare it to the costs associated with keeping that person alive and healthy, which isn't cheap either. Given the relatively small number of people who would genuinely want to die per year I can't see the system costing a huge amount. And given the rather high profile nature of right to die, I don't think it's going to be subject to the same level of cost cutting one would find in more mainstream NHS efforts.

What I really hope is that an ageing doctor with money to burn and little time left professionally takes the intuitive and gives Tony Nicklinson the morphine overdose he deserves. I don't think there is a jury who would convict him and it's questionable if the CPS would consider a prosecution to be in the public interest.

What science hasnt done has touched on my beliefs with any lasting idea. And it probably wont, it'll come up with theories as to why we have the ability to actually think about our place in the Universe (a highly unhelpful thing by evolutions standards dont you think) it'll come up with theories (most of them that fall down at the first hurdle) about why humanity is altruistic and holds altruism up as something good. But those theories arent proven, theyre no better than my theory that a God actually wants us to help each other out.


So yeah, call someone stupid for laughing in the face of obvious science. Do that all you want. I support progress, and rationality as much as you. However I dont thin the human mind is all ""science and rationality"" I think there is a hell of a lot more to it than that. 

But yeah. calling someone stupid because they believe there is a higher being? Or believing that humanity has been given a gift that science CANT explain? That just reeks of elitism, and not even an elitism that is backed up with proof, but an elitism that is often (in Dawkins case) backed up with strawmen and shoddy science.

Also I like how you constantly talk about these believes in creationism and a 6000 year old, like theyre such a huge contingent over in the UK. As I said, we're not in the US. This isnt Arizona.

At the end of the episode, Sally has lived the forward timeline we're seeing, and runs into the Doctor - not the Doctor she was conversing with on the TV (simplistic explanation) but the Doctor BEFORE he was attacked by the angles and sent back in time.  
  
This doctor now has the key to his own survival, the notes. These notes only exist BECAUSE he's attacked in the future and sent backwards. Those notes really shouldn't exist...but they do.  
  
Now, the Doctor knows when this all begins for Sally, so travels across his own timeline (bad) to set up the circumstances for his escape. He writes the sign on the wall, and waits for sally to appear. He tosses a rock to get her attention, then that's it. He can leave, knowing what comes next.  
  
Sally then has her adventure. This doctor starts his travels again, knowing that the angels are still to come in his future. I'm not sure how he knows to keep the notes with him, though he has an excellent memory, and may just have committed it to memory, and re-written it in the past.
