I watched ""Blink"", ""The Time of Angels"", and ""Flesh and Stone"" online and I loved it, but I did not fully understand some of the events due to not following the story previous to these episodes. 

So I ask you all, where should I begin? I understand this show has been running for many, many years, but I have browsed /r/doctorwho and noticed that some people said some of the earlier seasons did not hold their interest as much as the newer ones, and so I assume, they do not influence the story as much in the later seasons.

My progression as a fan of the show somewhat matches this, as a person who got into new Who first. OH and **Disclaimer**: I'm not insinuating anything about what a ""true"" fan is or how big of a fan a person has to be. This is a description of how a person may go from being a casual to very big fan based off of my own experience.

The casual fan who watches the show when it's on tv, tries to keep up with the new episodes as they air. They possibly lurk here on reddit and has seen a good deal of new Who. May or may not be determined to watch every episode of the new series. (This didn't happen to me.)

Then the really big new fan who is instantly hooked on the show. The person who blogs to their friends ""Omg I just found this amazing new show"" and then they marathon the new series. They gush on and on about a particular character they may adore. Rose, 10, 11...This is a pretty short stage. (I totally did this and everything else onwards.)

And then this fan ventures deeper into Whodom. They'll get over their bout of ""fangirl"" or ""fanboy"" and get more serious. Learning and reading up on classic Who and perhaps contemplating if they want to dip into it. They'll enjoy big discussions about companions (Rose vs River) and that kind of thing. And as they get more into the show, the fact that some people call him ""Dr. Who"" or ""Doctor Who"" will bug them a ton. It's a phase that'll pass.

After that, enter the realm of the rarer fans who try classic Who. Maybe they saw recommended episodes or went straight through classic. Perhaps these fans have even tried a radio drama or a book. And at this point, with such vast knowledge of the show, this kind of fan will usually engage in large discussions about making continuity fit together, or various theories or analytical discussions about characters or the culture of certain aliens... They'll see how the show has changed and progressed over the decades and how much real life influences and events and culture influenced the changes made in the show. And know about the writers and showrunners. The ""half human"" thing in the 1996 movie may or may not still drive one nuts.

And once you get that crazy about the show, it only gets deeper. You've seen the whole show. You are now determined to tackle on expanded universe material and you further weave this information into what you know, sifting through them, depending on how you view canonical issues. You name the names of the actors and producers and writers. You may not like all Doctors or companions, but you appreciate them. You may engage in large fan projects (this isn't exclusive to this stage of fandom really). Building Daleks or TARDISes, knitting scarves, writing stories, reconstructing lost episodes.

I had originally thought that it was sometime in the distant future given Jack's whole undying thing, but that doesn't explain how Alonzo is there. I also thought it might be Jack back when he was a time-agent, but the look he gave to the doctor, seemed like a look of recognition. and seeing as the doctor didn't know Jack in his years as a time agent, this doesn't seem plausible.

Permanently.  So I'm looking for a place to stay, and would appreciate any help and advice you may offer.  In particular, I'm looking for advice in the following areas:

1. Any neighborhoods to prefer or avoid? (Distance doesn't really matter, as long as I can bike/run to work, which is smack in the center of the town.  I'd say anything within 3 miles is perfect for walking; anything within 5 is great for biking)

2. What are the best practices for looking for an apartment/flat?  I assume I'd need to find something for a few weeks or a month, while I look through offerings and visit the offered places.  Can I actually tour apartments that are on the market?  Will I have better luck with on-line listings, or should I wait till I'm there to check brick-and-mortar agents?

3. Anything special to look for?  In particular, I'm interested in whether there are certain features that may not be considered standard for the UK, such as cable connection or central heating (sorry for my ignorance; I spent my last 16 years in the US and the most recent year in Ireland).

4. Furnished or unfurnished?  I assume that in the long run, unfurnished would be cheaper, but for starters, is it too inconvenient to go with unfurnished, or is there an IKEA nearby?

Cheers.

**Edit:** Many thanks for all your tips. I have now a much better understanding about a move to Oxford than I had with my last move, to Dublin.

I've lived in my flat for over a month, but still cannot have Internet access. In the US, this would be unheard of. I moved 5 times while living in New York City, and the longest you have to wait for the Internet installation is 4-5 days. And people still complain that it's too long.

Firstly, I tried Virgin Media, and waited 10 days for them to show up. They say that they can provide the service (they have a checker on the website), but when they show up for the actual appointment, they say that Virgin has no technical capabilities to bring the broadband into the property.

I contacted BeThere, but they use BT lines anyway, and would not provide the Internet without an activated BT landline.

When I initially called BT I was told that I have to have a mandatory landline (which I am not going to be using) in order to have the broadband Internet. This immediately took me back to the nostalgia of a dialup about 20 years ago in the US. I was also informed that I cannot even place an order for the broadband without placing an order for the landline first and activating it. I was told that on the next day after landline activation, I can call for the broadband order.

Anyway, I made an appointment to activate the landline, and it was available only 25 days after placing my order. This is unreasonably slow, considering that all the wiring is already done in my flat (it's built anew). There is also a BT connector in the basement of my building with all the lines and wires ready.

The BT appointment to activate the landline was yesterday. They never showed up. I called BT, and was told that they did not have to come to the property to reactivate the landline, it will be activated by the midnight, and that I have to call the next day to place a new order for the broadband. This made me suspicious. I was correct in my doubts, and sure enough, when I called today, they said that my landline reactivation order failed, and was cancelled. And that I have to start over again.

Speaking with two representatives, it took 1 hour 36 minutes to place a new order. I heard again this pitch about mandatory landline and qualifying 10 calls per month that I am supposed to place at a certain hour on certain days to particular area codes. If I fail to do so, it's a £5.18 monthly charge on top of the landline regular monthly charge. They basically will charge me for not using the phone that I don't need and don't want to have at the first place. On top of that it is an 18-months mandatory contract with a cancellation fee for everything - the landline and the broadband. I don't even have a physical phone and I seriously do not need it. Mobile is more than enough.

There is also a charge to ship equipment to my house via Royal Mail, and I have to wait for the delivery on the separate day, and be physically present to accept it. In the US, the Internet provider technicians just bring it to the appointment.

BT informed me that my installation will be on July 25th (!!!!!???) after I already waited almost a month for the yesterday's appointment. It's clearly not my fault that BT failed to activate the line yesterday. I conveyed it to the representative, but was told that the sales rep does not have any power over the appointments times, and they just take the closest ones that the computer system offers.

I feel like I was planted in some alternate reality in a David Linch's movie against my will. This just cannot be happening in a civilised society. I am going to make sure to write to all consumer protection agencies that exist in the UK. Do you know of any?

Any advice for me on what to do? I seriously don't want to give any business to BT assholes, because they appear to be from the dark ages of customer service while providing the Internet from the 80s. I haven't used their service yet, but they already made me so unhappy, mad and unwilling to deal with them, that I cannot even convey it to you without expletives.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,"Just moved to London from NYC and having the most schizophrenic experience, unsuccessfully trying to install the Internet for over a month.

""Tottenham is a big, big club and this is a big opportunity for me. I thought let's give it a go before it was too late. I could have gone to Newcastle before, didn't take that job and many people said ‘he hasn't got the ambition' but this is a chance for me and let's see how it goes.

""It was difficult to leave Portsmouth, for sure. If I hadn't been at such a good club and enjoying my life so much, it would have been easy (to move).

Harry now has the task of turning around our fortunes and our much-publicised poor start to the league campaign with no wins and two draws from our opening eight games.

Harry insisted that is all he's concentrating on now. ""The league is the only priority now,"" he said. ""We can talk about trying to win cups but we have to stay in the Premier League and improve our position.

""There are some good players at the club who haven't done as well as they should have done so we have to get them playing to their maximum and if we do that, we'll be okay.

Finally, on leaving Pompey, Harry said: ""Peter Storrie is a very close friend and I am grateful to him for the way he has dealt with this. I leave Portsmouth in good shape, they've some fantastic players at the moment and there is no reason for them not to have another great season.""

AVB:

Speaking as the new Head Coach, Andre Villas-Boas said, “Tottenham Hotspur is a great club with a strong tradition and fantastic support, both at home and throughout the world.  I feel privileged to be its coach.  For me, this is one of the most exciting coaching positions in the Premier League.  I have had several discussions with the Chairman and the Board and I share their vision for the future progress of the Club.  This is a squad any coach would love to work with and together I believe we can bring success in the seasons ahead.""

tldr; Harry says: blah blah look at me and all the negative things about this tottenham im doing a favour for blah blah. AVB says: look at tottenham and how good we are and how great we can be.

Just seen AVB's been appointed to the Spurs job. Knackers because I like him. I think it's an excellent appointment. While with hindsight we can all see it was never likely to work at Chelsea due to the presence of oh-so-many Charlie Big Potatoes at Stamford Bridge, I think he'll find some receptive ears in the Spuds' dressing room. They have a nucleus of a young squad, supplemented by some old, experienced heads (assuming Friedel's still playing and Gallas hasn't yet fallen out with everyone) and a manager who will have no shortage of motivation to show that his previous employers were wrong to ditch him.

Levy does seem a fairly diligent chairman and has many creditable success to his name in his role at Tottenham. He has a fair few failures, too. One of them should really have spung to mind as an immediate reference point the second pen was put to paper on the subject of Spurs and AVB - Juande Ramos. A fairly young (in the game) manager with striking new ideas, a long-term vision and untold (if relative) Iberian successes, Ramos ultimately proved a complete failure at White Hart Lane, leading the club to a bottom-half finish and then offering Harry Redknapp's favourite achievement to him on a plate. And who could forget the absolute dross Levy sanctioned the signing of for Ramos, at incredible expense. In fact, if Redknapp was to be believed, Levy was incredibly hands-on with transfers at Tottenham. I haven't even started on the sh*tstorm surrounding Tottenham's attempts at a ground move. Let's not pretend that his copy book is without blot. He may have turned a profit on Mido, but he signed off on his signing in the first place!


Villas-Boas showed absolutely no inclination to properly utilise his squad at Chelsea - Kalou was dropped entirely and Bertrand, McEachran and Lukaku ignored. Alex and Anelka were banished from the car park, ffs. A quick glance at the appearance stats of the players Villas-Boas apparently dropped and rotated (ahem, Lampard) demonstrates pretty clearly that he generally used the same players over and over again (double ahem, Bosingwa) was unwilling to make use of many other players. Contrast his use of the squad with Di Matteo's after him. Not much of an alternative to Redknapp's 14 men, eh? I won't even get started on his alleged footballing principles and vision - they're massively overstated and he regularly abandoned them.

Villas-Boas may prove an astute appointment and it's very plausible that his first real tastes of failure will be his making. It's equally as likely that he's a smooth-talking, PowerPoint presentation-waving shyster. I remain confident that Chelsea's real mistake was appointing and not firing him. I'm willing to bet it'll be just as much of a mistake for Spurs, probably more so. After all, I can't see Tim Sherwood stepping in and leading them to a European Cup. Can you?

I wasn't sad to see 'Arry go, I just worry Spurs will be less likely to, well, to be Spurs under AVB. The only thing likely to count against AVB, is that he's not 'Arry. This makes Spurs' start to the new campaign vital, Modric or no Modric. If he can get off to a good start then I would suggest that, in much the same way as the chaps in the press hushed the extent of their noise about Roy Hodgson, the same may well happen here (which could then leave 'Arry high and dry... which would just be very funny).


It's risky. But this is one of the best young coaches in Europe. He went to Chelsea a job too soon, but as may well be better for the experience. What many felt he needed was a club on the verge of Champions League, whom he could take there while making them his own side.

As time wore on at Chelsea, he stopped playing his high line so often, and adapted to the strengths of the side rather than his vision. The 4-3-3 he played at Porto was a very different system to the 4-3-3 that Chelsea have long depended upon, he utilised devastating counter-attacking speed rather than the brute strength and control which Chelsea used to knock aside opponents. Both are valid systems, but only with the right players.

In Lennon and Bale, with ball-playing midfielders as effective as Modric (hopefully..) and excellent, swift attacking fullbacks, AVB has a side who can play this system very well. We may have been known for a fairly expansive style for the first half of last season, but AVB has played good football which can beat better sides - something Redknapp managed to do in the season we qualified for the Champions League (back-to-back wins against Chelsea and Arsenal in the last few weeks of the season, something we could only dream about this year despite having a better side) but not since. The players we put out next season will be adapted to the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition, not just as many of our first-choice 11 who were fit, with half of them playing free roles.

There are worries though. Will he have learnt enough adaptability from his Chelsea failure? Will he communicate better with the players? Will those players listen to his tactical briefings after the ""go out and enjoy yourselves"" Redknapp motivation? Without as many egos and factions as existed at Chelsea, I'm hopeful. I could see a player like Van der Vaart getting frustrated and leaving. But beyond that, we don't have many players older than the manager, nor players who have been there so long that they think they run the place (except perhaps King, who unfortunately should probably retire into a coaching role). This could be an ideal environment for a talented young manager to build his side.

More importantly: Daniel Levy has long-term visions for the club, including the new stadium in the next few seasons. As money-influenced and irritating as some of his decisions have been, they've generally been shown to be in the club's best interest and worked out well. After blowing the Champions League spot this year, he knows there's going to have to be a rebuilding of the side to set it up for qualification long term. The teams around us have improved significantly. We need to make sure we're moving forward with them, while spending sensibly to keep the Naming Rights Stadium on track. This is a crossroads, but if it works, we could have a long and successful path (of increasingly poor metaphor) in front of us.

TL;DR:implosion of last season less likely to be repeated...but then again I am perhaps underestimating Spurs' overwhelming capacity to shoot themselves in the foot (cf. the sacking of Jol, Martin, and hiring of Ramos, Juande).

I put it on while I work and it is usually great background stuff;  I also like catching people re-enacting the crossing.

This morning (evening UK time), I saw a woman run into the street, right into a car, who then drove off even though she was obviously injured.  

I am not sure what the laws are like in England, and I don't think it is entirely this car's fault.  However, the guy left a hurt woman on the street and just took off.  How can I get this to the proper authorities?


I have screencaps of when it happened here:
[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/lkhfh).  I think you can see the license plate on the second picture.

You can also see the video by going to the Archives from the webcam link, then selecting 5-6PM.  It happens right around 5:58 PM.

Again, any help to handle this properly would be great!

[EDIT] I am in the US, so I do not know how to get to the proper police.  If you could help me, that'd be great.

[EDIT2] They removed the link on the Archives for the hour at which this happened..

Since paypal won't let any one sell 'raffle' tickets through their site, I'm trying to figure out a way to do this. Even if I have to use index cards with your username on it, in a bucket. I would even send you valid photo proof that you name has been written down and added to the drawing.

There's also companies that will talk in vague terms about 'marketing', but upon further inspection turn out to be door-to-door sales. Bah.

Are there any honest, legitimate positions actually available for graduates? How can you distinguish when an opportunity is legitimate? Is this how things always are for 'graduates-without-technical-skills'?

So there's a live requirement at one of the companies I work for, for a Javascript developer.&lt;b&gt;

Must haves: Javascript (around 3 years, but if you're good and have only been doing it for a while, that'll count in your favour), HTML, CSS familiarity with Dojo, experience of working on a Linux platform, experience odf MySQL, and if you've got experience with  couple of other scripting languages (Ruby, Perl etc) that helps as well.&lt;b&gt;

More important than that is a love of music and digital design. The job involves a mix of the two, and the thick JS client is built around offering music streaming to a number of cross browser platforms. Sound complicated? I'll have to explain it in person! &lt;b&gt;

My number is 0207 648 4807 and my email is tom.harvey@volteurope.com. Hit me up if it sounds like your bag, and lets get the ball rolling!

Ready? Here goes:


There's a man in a box, who I've heard of in books,

A knight gallivanting through time.

He's sly as a fox, cleverer than he looks,

A perpetual solver of crime.


He's curious and odd, but there's nothing, I'm sure,

That he couldn't fix if he tried.

He's a Universe Mod, his intentions are pure,

I asked for his name, but he lied.


He said:


""The Doctor's my name, just please follow me,

And I hope that your shoes are on tight,""

He further proclaimed, ""then we can all see,

If I can make everything right.""


He's had so many faces, and so many friends,

I lost count a while ago.

He's been so many places, the tale never ends,

So many chapters that I'll never know.


I saw him one day, when his phone box appeared,

I'll remember well after I'm dead.

He sprinted my way, and as the man neared,

He shouted at me, and he said:


He said:


""The Doctor's my name, just please follow me,

And I hope that your shoes are on tight,""

He further proclaimed, ""then we can all see,

If I can make everything right.""


I've heard people sayin' that no one could ever,

Finally kill off the Doc.

'Cause the man's Gallifreyan; he could go forever,

A constant in time, our rock.


He's run for so long, though, it makes me afraid,

That he might get tired and trip.

I told him I thought so, and he pointed and made

A grin, walking back to his ship,


He said:


""The Doctor's my name, just please follow me,

And I hope that your shoes are on tight,""

He further proclaimed, ""then we can all see,

If I can make everything right.""


Then he left in a hurry; he left me behind,

And I never said, ""So long.""

I've been left here to worry, the Doc on my mind,

To take the edge off, I wrote him a song


'bout how he said:


""The Doctor's my name, just please follow me,

And I hope that your shoes are on tight,""

How he further proclaimed, ""then we can all see,

If I can make everything right.""

That link right there. It's a UCL Final Kit. Now where can I get one in regular mens sizes? I love the small print on the front, and want to get #8, but I can't find a site that's offering one :/ 

FURTHERMORE, awhile back, I posted about where I could get an England kit. Well, as an update, I'm getting two, and one will not be Gerrard as I previously said. A white, home John Terry and black, away Ashley Cole is my final decision. KTBFFH

So ya, if anybody can be a hero and help me, I'd appreciate it. Cech's jersey will come one day, along with a Torres 3rd or away kit, but I just need one for the game against AC Milan in Miami. Cheers.

We certainly have the ability to win it, and people will say they don't care about the Europa League right now, but I guarantee you some of those people would be screaming themselves hoarse if we got as far as the quarterfinals or semifinals. My thinking is that if we get past the group stage, we should take it a bit more seriously.

So there's a live requirement at one of the companies I work for, for a Javascript developer.&lt;b&gt;

Must haves: Javascript (around 3 years, but if you're good and have only been doing it for a while, that'll count in your favour), HTML, CSS familiarity with Dojo, experience of working on a Linux platform, experience odf MySQL, and if you've got experience with couple of other scripting languages (Ruby, Perl etc) that helps as well.&lt;b&gt;

More important than that is a love of music and digital design. The job involves a mix of the two, and the thick JS client is built around offering music streaming to a number of cross browser platforms. Sound complicated? I'll have to explain it in person! &lt;b&gt;

My number is 0207 648 4807 and my email is tom.harvey@volteurope.com. Hit me up if it sounds like your bag, and lets get the ball rolling!

Cheers guys,

Tom

I don't like to be one who sits complaining about things and hoping they will just change. There are a lot of things with the country that I'd like to do my bit at improving, but without getting into politics, or leaving a full-time job and dedicating my life to it, I don't see how I can.

So, my question (posted in r/UnitedKingdom, not AskReddit, as I want to know something serious, and not your favourite sex position), how can I make a hands on, positive impact? Where can I find smaller charities, or causes that I can help?

* Watching a football team means you want a transfer there, this impeccable logic is why the Standard have linked [Super Frank Lampard](http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/lampard-heading-for-a-galaxy-far-far-away-7917302.html) with LA Galaxy, again, this ones going to run and run.

* In news to no-one really [Di Matteo](http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/158960.html?CMP=OTC-RSS) has transfer money to spend, NO SHIT SHERLOCK

* [Meireles](http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/904252-chelseas-raul-meireles-tracked-by-napoli-and-tottenham) has been liked with a move away again, this time to Napoli and Tottenham, seems like if your Portuguese and at Chelsea, AVB wants you.

* back to Portuguese players vaguely linked with us; [Periera](http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/transfer-rumours/120705/chelsea-target-not-thinking-leaving-porto-insists-agent-1759) is apparently NOT leaving Porto, which is great because we don't really need  another left back.

* The mail are speculating that as RVP has left Arsenal that other players may also leave, this includes another story that won't go away; [Walcott](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2169081/Theo-Walcott-alerts-Chelsea-Robin-van-Persie-Arsenal-snub.html) 

* PSG have commented that they are not in for [JohnTerry](http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_1_15639_psg-deny-interest-in-chelsea-captain-terry.html), PHEW, I really thought that might happen for a second...

* And finally [Ashley Cole](http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/80440/Chris-Brown-Parties-With-Ashley-Cole-Wayne-Rooney-In-LA-) was seen partying the night away with Wayne Rooney and general nice guy Chris Brown, Lyndsey Lohan turned up too, CLASSY!

I'm Rossi and I work as a Game Talent Recruiter for LadyGeek.com - we recruit (both men and women) for the game industry.

Right now I'm in a dire need of Java and ActionScript programmers for a few studios that make facebook and web-based games. I guarantee the pay is very good, but also varies depending on your experience, so I can't say a certain number. There are a few roles from Intermediate to Senior roles, sadly no Junior/Graduate positions. The studios are based in London and it's a bonus if you actually like games and don't mind making facebook games. 

For more details and if you're interested send me your CV and work you've done on rossi@ladygeek.com. I can tell you which studios they are in private and what projects they're currently working on.

Here's two I can think of:

- Turn Left: I don't see this series 4 gem get mentioned compared to Library/Forest or Midnight or the specials. But this offers a grim alternate reality where the Doctor is dead. This really shows when the Titanic replica wipes out the entirety of London. This causes massive relocations, borders getting closed, and eventually the most horrifying bit: non-English folk getting sent to ""labor camps"". You don't think about these kinds of massive repercussions when watching Voyage of the Damned or other episodes. It's also a great tie-in to the finale.
- Waters of Mars: This one gets mentioned quite a bit, but I don't see a lot of people pinning it down as a favorite.

I watched 'Blink', and 'Flesh and Stone'. I was already basically in love with the show, I've just yet to watch more.

I watched these two episodes closely, back to back, and only those two, so it's possible I'm missing something. But, regardless, here's my problem: In 'Flesh and Stone' it goes through the issues of the fact that anything that takes the image of an angel becomes an angel. This was reinforced several times and explicitly said, so there's no way around it. At the end of the episode 'Blink', however, Sally gives an envelope to the Doctor with instructions on how to get out of 1969. If you look at the envelope before she hands it to the Doctor, it clearly has a picture of a Weeping Angel in it. 

I want to doubt that this was done on accident; could it be why the Doctor got trapped in 1969 in the first place? Sorry if that's an invalid question, I haven't watched enough to know. If it is plausible that was how he got trapped in 1969, then doesn't this itself create a time paradox? I know, I know, 'wibbly wobbly, timey wimey' but if that's how he trapped himself, wouldn't that mean there's some kind of chain of cause and effect that's broken here?

I think purely defensively, this lineup is better than say, a JT-Cahill or JT-Luiz partnership; Cahill is much quicker than Terry now and works well with Luiz. I think JT reads the game much better than either Cahill or Luiz, so without him there is a definite loss in tactical ability. We would also be losing our captain without JT, but think that Lampard is fully able to carry that role as shown in the UCL final. I'm not saying for a second that we should drop JT, but just that for huge games, I would probably rather see Cahill and Luiz start together. I honestly think that Cahill and Luiz could become one of the best centre-back partnerships if given time to really learn each other's style of play.

I don't really know what I should read. With the MegaUpload news managing to sneak by most news outlets (which I personally think is quite a big deal, with one country bullying another), it feels as though many don't want to report on it.

I understand that all things would have an agenda of some sort, but I am looking for one that doesn't avoid reporting things in fear of scaring advertisers, and one that doesn't have a political bias. One that isn't financed by people who encourage them to turn a blind eye to some issues.

Ideally it won't be something that only focusses on a single issue (such as digital rights), but is willing to give the world news without political, corporate and national bias.

            ---Lampard/Meireles--Mikel/Lampard---

This is the lineup i think looks the strongest on paper in my opinion with Mceachran and de bruyne, most likely going on loan for next season.
I think this lineup would bring us a lot of speed on the flanks and would us a very dangerous on counter attacks while still being able to be the controlling team against most opponents.
The good thing is that we so many players that can play on different positions in the midfield. It makes it harder for a rookie like my self to determine what would be the best lineup.

Me and my brother have been looking for a specific type of job for a long time now and have not been successful. I am 18 and he is 17. We are looking for repetitive work such as on the production line and will not mind having to lift heavy weights. We are looking for experience as such minimum wage is acceptable although more will be very appreciated. We are both available for permanent work through the summer whereas I may take a gap year before going to university and may stay for more than a year. I much rather do real work than live off of benefit.

Although I have no real work experience I have more than five A-Cs in my GCSEs. Two of which are for science. I am also predicted three Cs for my A-Levels. In my two years in college I also completed 105 hours of sports activities. 

If you have a vacancy and are interested please PM me.

Lost in space

Eyes full of stars

I'd go anywhere with you

Only angels could pull me away

Please don't leave me

Not again

Want to be your constant companion

Not just the girl who waited

I need a doctor

Call me a doctor
.
.
.

""Nine""

I look at you with wonder

My lovely English Rose

I watch you fly

Like Lucy in the sky

Universe at your feet

And stars in your eyes

Fickle like a fluttering flag

Frail and in flux

To a symbol of strength in your sway

Never imagined this shop girl

Might save the whole world

But you sure saved me

Stay inside, little lightning rod

Never know what's lurking outside

An end to all beginnings

Or a big Bad Wolf
.
.

""Angel""

Don't hide your eyes, angel

I promise I won't

Turn you to stone

Leave this lonely existence

Life is short

And you might be worth

A journey to the past

Spread those wings

You can take me away

I'd wait two thousand years

Just to see those eyes

Did I tell you you're beautiful?

Or has that not happened yet?

Weep not, fair angel

I'll fly you away someday

And then I promise

No more waiting",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Thought I'd post a couple of my older Who-related poetry,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/w57y8/thought_id_post_a_couple_of_my_older_whorelated/

Gaining experience with statistics would also be incredibly useful!

My experience: I graduated last year with a 2:1 in Maths from Glasgow University. My dissertation was on the topic of Knot Theory where I built a program based on combinatorical theory to construct a table of unique knots. Courses I took included Analysis, Topology, Discrete Maths, Mathematical Ecology and Numerical Analysis. Since then I have been waitressing and working as a croupier, looking for graduate work or experience.

My skills: I'm pretty confident with Matlab and have taught myself the basics of Python using the Khan Academy videos! I am a qualified first aider and a Padi Rescue Diver.

I said the C word. Mainly because I've been talking with a couple people about canon. I've been telling them it doesn't exist for Doctor Who. And then I went and talked to a good friend of mine off-Reddit about it. He can always convince me of anything. And he may have convinced me about the existence of canon in Doctor Who.

He convinced me that it has a canon. That the canon is the tv show. And that canon is a thing that should be thrown in the garbage. (I kind of believed that last one anyways). And I still think that not all franchises have or need one. And frankly, with all the headache it's caused me, I wish canon would just fall in a hole and *die*.

So even if I tell you guys now, that I believe the tv show is the canon of Doctor Who (and I'm still thinking about this one), I still am going to vehemently glare at *anyone* who uses the rebuttal ""That's not canon."" Which is starting to become the thorn in my side. And it's also like the more recent excuse ""The Doctor lies."" Except that the canon excuse is more powerful and evil.

This is what my friend said to me to convince me about canon:

-----------

I think the thing here is, you can always argue that the BBC hasn't ruled a canon because it's never used the word, but to me, if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck and swims like a duck...So let's stick with the Biblical analogy. The BBC never uses the word canon in the same way the Church doesn't because to the majority of people it's not important. To the majority of people, the Bible is the official books, and similarly to the majority of people, the Official Episode Guide will be the official Doctor Who stories, and that guide will only ever have the television series in it. Mark Campbell releases an ""Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide To Doctor Who"" ever couple of years, and that has a complete list of audio stories, novels, comics and spin-offs, but I guarantee you, the moment he asks the BBC to authorise it and make it official, you can guess which slew of material will be removed. Why? Because there is a canon and the BBC have defined it as the television series. Again, it's part of their charter that their television shows *cannot* have story elements that rely on media outside of television. Their very charter implies a canon, even if it doesn't spell it out.

So, as you say, there are a few documentaries and books that only have Doctors 9 - 11, but just because you can pick up editions of the Bible that only have the New Testament (primarily aimed at Christians), doesn't mean the Church has de-canonised the old testament, it just means it's targetting a specific group. So for Doctor Who, the new series is our new testament and the BBC releases material targetting just the people who are interested in that section. Doesn't mean they don't have a canon, any more than a copy of the Bible only having the New Testament doesn't mean the Church have thrown away their canon.

So as far the BBC are concerned - their charter - then, yes to ""actually happen"" it has to appear on television - or be defined by it, at any rate (the Time War ""actually happened"" even though we didn't see it on television). Writers can make obscure references (Chelonians, etc), but in Biblical terms, there are references to Lilith in the Bible and the Jews have developed a great mythology around her, but she's still non-canonical because the Church has ruled out that book that writes about her. 

One of the big things that causes ruptions about canon, I think, is that some of the louder voices in fandom are novelists, and there is a belief that by people accepting that the BBC have made a canon, somehow means their books are either a bit crap, or are nothing more than fan-fiction (Jonathan Blum is a big offender in this regard), but it's simply not true. The Ian Fleming Foundation define the James Bond canon, and they define it (although, again, they have never used the word canon) as the Ian Fleming novels. It doesn't mean John Gardner's or Raymond Benson's novels are crap, or just fan-fiction, it just means they are non-canonical. But at the end of the day, James Bond fans don't *care* what is canon, because they have their own idea of what happens in James Bond's life.

**Doctor Who fans should be the same. We need to accept that there is a canon, that the BBC have defined it, that their very charter defines it, and then just throw it away.** We already have out own Whoniverses, and ironically the only people affected by the BBC's canon are the current writers and showrunner of Doctor Who.

----------------

There. That bold text there. Maybe I wouldn't have given such a big crap about canon if I just threw it away. I don't like the idea of canon because then people get to go around telling me that all these wonderful fictional stories I've enjoyed about the Whoniverse are less real than other stories. Not like we all haven't secretly shunned certain parts of canon away... Canon is an evil thing whose use should be reserved the people making the show.

If we fans threw canon away, we could all just accept and deny whatever pieces of the franchise we wanted without others condemning us. So I'm going to sit here and think about accepting the concept of canon. And then happily toss it into the rubbish bin.

**TLDR** I accept that canon exists and is the tv show. I don't care about it though. Things that aren't canon haven't necessarily not happened. Canon is a hindrance and a pain in the butt to enjoying the franchise (cutting off stories). Canon is for showrunners and fans should reject it.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Doctor Who and Canon (Wall of Text),4,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/w5z1n/doctor_who_and_canon_wall_of_text/

* Here's something you've all been waiting for, [Hulk](http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/hulk-seeks-chelsea-move-for-world-cup-boost) news. Ok his agent (who we all know and love) apparently says he his desperate for a move to Chelsea, without actually mentioning Chelsea.

* Ok This story has been doing the rounds basically because we have a player in the last year of his contract who hasn't signed a new one yet; [Ashley Cole](http://www.caughtoffside.com/2012/07/06/chelsea-full-back-ashley-cole-linked-with-shock-real-madrid-move/) to somewhere. read this line ""as ESPN can reveal there are no talks at present"" and the realisation this is pure BS become clear.

* Inter Milan have snuck ahead in the race to sign [Moura](http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/transfer-rumours/120706/inter-milan-set-beat-chelsea-brazil-starlet-176012) which is a shame because he looks a tad tasty.

* Ever wondered what [Jason Cundy](http://www.talksport.co.uk/radio/hawksbee-and-jacobs/120706/cundy-walcott-chelsea-link-176025) thinks about the Walcott to Chelsea rumours? No me neither, if you're curious however please click the link above or perhaps go boil your head.

* [Schweinsteiger](http://www.chelsea.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=530001) is NOT coming to Chelsea, no matter what this ill informed blogger thinks, the whole article is based on one tweet.

* [VICTOR MOSES](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-set-for-victor-moses-transfer-1134243) IS COMING IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, we are saved.

* [Modric](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/luka-modric-has-agreed-terms-with-real-1135006) has apparently agreed personal terms with Real and all we're waiting on is Daniel levy. Expect this one to run and run and run.

* [Tiote](http://football-talk.co.uk/65019/20m-tiote-on-the-move/) is on the move and now Arsenal are interested, well he is young and **speaks** French so no surprise, I like him a lot, but we're being linked with an awful lot of central midfielders

* At last, we have something to thank [Claudio Pizarro](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/marko-marin-says-chelsea-transfer-1134975) about! He apparently persuaded Marin to come to Chelsea, ""It's great"" He said, ""They pay you loads of money and you don't even have to score"" I may have made that quote up, but hey everyone else does.

* and finally Ex-Chelsea star [Wayne Bridge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18740583) has completed a one year loan move to Brighton and Hove Albion, thing is Gus Poyets boys have a pre-season
match with Chelsea. If JT plays it may not be that friendly!",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Rumour Roundup: Hulk Sulk,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/w65f2/rumour_roundup_hulk_sulk/

I'll be interviewing some of the players afterwords as well, so photos of them being interviewed will be crucial.

It's from 2 onwards (I wouldn't expect myself to be there until six, but prepare to..).

This is a non-profit story that will be displayed on the [Hidden City](http://thehiddencity.net/) a non profit organisation that documents Birmingham's hidden stories.

The format of the documentary will be that of an audio slideshow, which is why quality pictures are needed! That, along with great audio make a perfect viewing.

The reason i'm asking on this subreddit is because most of the people who make up the Hidden City are students, including myself. My usual photographers are away, and no one has got back in touch with me as of now.

So anyone who can come along to the below address tomorrow equipped for some good photography and an interest in the sport, please PM me.

I feel I do need to state that this is UNPAID, due to it being a story for a non profit site.

THANKS! /r/brum, you are my only hope.

Welcome to the unofficial weather moaning thread for Saturday the 7th of July. On a day where the rain warning has been raised to [AMBER](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18750430) (as in, holy balls it's wet), cars have had to be rescued in Midlothian, Sheepy Magna has been evacuated and the Grand Prix is wet as a duck's arse, I thought we needed a place to vent.

Here's a [link to the BBC weather page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/), and here's a link to my personal favourite weather site, [Weatherspark](http://weatherspark.com/)

So: what's the weather like where you are? Bloody typical, isn't it? Anyone for a cup of tea?

**Edit 1**: WIMBLEDON AND THE GRAND PRIX ARE TEMPORARILY DELAYED. Start building your arks, people, this is it...

**Edit 2**: So both the tennis and the Grand Prix are back on, although it's wet as anything at Silverstone. It seems that most people are having fine weather; my question to you is why aren't you enjoying it?! Today is all the summer you'll be getting for years most likely.

**Edit 3**: Sunny in Cumbria, Blackpool, Birmingham, Leeds, Wimbledon (according to the telly), Newcastle, Preston, York, Kent, Warwickshire; lucky bastards.

---

**Final Edit** Just goes to show we Brits love nothing more than a good moan! Be it too hot, too cold, too wet, too dry, not sunny enough, too sunny, not cloudy enough, not dry enough; what ever it is, we're not happy about it and we love not being happy about it.

After around 2 months of being with them they asked me for evidence that my mother had 5 years NCD(No claims discount) in my car which I only purchased in January this year. 

She was put as the main driver of the car and I used her NCD she had in total from all of her cars form the past 15 or so years to help get it cheaper for me.

I was away for a while when they gave me a deadline of sending them evidence of this which I clearly didn't have and I did not say those NCD on that car only(Car is only 8 years old) and my insurance went from ~£80 to £400 a month. I obviously cancelled and had to pay a £56 fee to cancel(which they tried to increase the next day)

Aviva was my cheapest quote by miles(using my mother as main driver) and the cheapest quote I have for myself is £1890, which my car is only worth around £1500 and I only work part time and can't afford that.

I know for a fact from friends who drive and want to drive can barely afford it. The ones that do, usually have had financial help from families.

Don't shit on people for having bad rumours - shit on the rumour not the poster.

Skepticism is encouraged. Or not. It's up to you, really. 

**Summary of rumours so far:**

""IN"":

Steven Davis - Signed for S~~underland~~outhampton.

Solomon Kalou - Signing for Lille. I hear Joe Cole knows a good pasty place.

Gaston Ramirez - ????????

Demba Ba - Last seen in a Greggs on Tyneside, stuck in line behind Cisse. 

Hugo Lloris - Talk has quietened down now, mainly Arsenal and Spurs being linked. 

Mark Davies - JUST SIGN ALREADY

Fabio Borini - Officially a Roma player now, but still talk that he's coming to us. I say sign Mark Davies and he'll be begging to join us. 

OUT:

Suarez - [Occasional Juve talk.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6pu0djLWt1qcwic6.gif) Sure.

Andy Carroll - [AC Milan rumours.](http://i.imgur.com/gnYWX.gif) [Some people believe them.](http://i.imgur.com/gcMF6.gif) Last seen trying to imbue Wee Jay with some swag. 

Aquilani - May be included in a Gaston Ramirez deal. I don't even know anymore. 

[Maxi](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Jo89QrLYdxQ/T-IbKu_EKJI/AAAAAAAABEw/SZa2Y5yH7J8/s500/Maxi-Ramsey.gif) - No talk for a while, but he's back in Liverpool.

For the UK supporters, I'm assuming you're all well-versed in the membership scheme, so this post is for all international fans...

[GET AN INTERNATIONAL MEMBERSHIP NOW](http://www.chelseafc.com/page/Membership_International/0,,10268,00.html)

First, and most importantly, you're an official member of the club.  You'll be a card carrying supporter of the club we all love.

Second, and of equal importance, you get priority ticket access.  Unless you are planning on seeing lower-importance matches, good luck getting match tickets on general sale that are not in the West Upper, last row.  Even then, you risk a sell-out.  We all know how small the Bridge is capacity wise in relation to ticket demand.  With a membership, you build loyalty points on purchases and membership renewal, including buying from the megastore.  If you're worried about tickets, the £30 membership is a great way to go.

Third, you get access to Chelsea TV online and on mobile.  While they don't stream live matches, you CAN get live audio streams, on mobile or online (mobile is nice for those who have to work during matches), and they replay all the matches midnight GMT the night of the game.

With CTV, you also get live reserves league and youth cup matches, including FA Youth Cup.  That's reason enough for me for the £30.  In addition, you'll get extended highlights online and on mobile.  CTV is a great perk to the membership.

Other perks include megastore discounts and teamcard discounts online.  

Bottom line, £30 is a small price to pay for ticket priority, CTV access, and to be an officially recognized member of the club.


As a sidenote, you should also look into becoming a member of your local supporters chapter.  The NY Blues, for example, get ticket allocation at the same time as season ticket holders in the UK.  As a mate of mine in London said when he found out our priority, ""You have an easier time getting tickets than I do!""

I hope this helps.  Up the Chels!

The best comparable offer we have is the [all line rover](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/promotions/pr569241c35ce74100fb0de1b9798124/details.html) which is also England, Scotland and Wales, which is £680 for 14 days and has certain restrictions.

It also stings when you realise that, for example, Birmingham to Paignton return anytime is £167. For one journey both ways.

I find it irritating that as uk residents we have helped fund the railways and I believe we still do in part, yet we have to pay over 3 times more for a train pass that has restrictions than someone who doesn't live here.

I realise it's done to encourage tourism, and I realise that it is because we have high fares that the britpass can be lower, and I'm not complaining about that specifically. My complaint is that our single fares, season tickets and even the anywhere (with conditions) pass costs so *much* more.

To be fair you can buy 2x brit passes - one for the visitor and for the uk resident - for the £265 each, so long as you travel together on each journey.

Add to this all the confusion over ticket types (offpeak vs advance vs anytime) along with having to mess about with singles, returns and splitting your journey manually in order to find the best deal, and I really can see why people just buy a car.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,A rant about train pass pricing - BritPass vs All Line Rover,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/w7chd/a_rant_about_train_pass_pricing_britpass_vs_all/

And girls. And any guys pretending to be girls. I want to share with you a story about a man, some fans, and a football club. 

So, let's meet our man. He's a college student in America. He played soccer all through high school, but American Football was his passion. He grew up believing that one day, he would wear a headset and prowl the sidelines barking out orders to titans disguised as human beings, who'd toss an egg-shaped ball of sorts up and down a field. His first personal sporting memory was crying after his favorite team, the Colts,  lost to the hated Steelers the year they were supposed to win everything. As this man grew older, he realized that there was no interest in hiring a soccer player who happened to love football as a coach, so he figured he'd write about the game he loved. He found out he was a great writer, despite his prolific use of the pronoun 'he' (but sometimes, he needed the word to get his point across). He went to college to become the writer he was meant to be. But things were going poorly. Like most any owner, he began accruing debt faster than he was making money. His family fell apart. He felt depression sinking in, and he didn't know what to do about it. All this time, he felt like there was something missing in his love for american football. It was like the feeling you get at the beginning of the end of a long term relationship. 

That feeling, palpable albeit indescribable, caused him to search for something more. He turned to the sport of his youth, but had no idea who to cheer for. He spoke German, so he tried to pick a team from the Bundesliga. But, as he would come to find, a club picks you, not the other way around. He felt an odd, but somehow natural, dislike of both Manchester United and Chelsea. He was a big fan of music, and from his knowledge of the Beatles knew about this city in the north of England. Liverpool. His favorite band was Pink Floyd, but he knew both Gilmour and Waters to be Arsenal fans. Then, one night, he was listening to one of their most underrated albums: *Meddle*. A [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCgQuj8v2gg) came on that he had heard before. This night he was curious who sung the chant in the song. That name popped up again. Liverpool. The man was sold.

So, with the optimism of an adventurer setting out on a long path, the man became a supporter of Liverpool FC. From the very beginning he knew he made the right choice. This was a club for the working class. His class. He valued tradition. No club in the entire world possessed a better history. But, the most important thing he found was a phrase, the same phrase he found in that one song. You'll Never Walk Alone. He felt low before he found Liverpool. His fellow supporters picked him up along the way. The phrase meant something.

He learned about the legends of the past. He read the tales of Shankly, of Paisley. He found the highlights of great players of the past. He watched that glorious champions cup final from 2005, and cried as Vladimir Smicer slammed home the winning penalty. Along the way he found a subreddit of fans like him, each with their own story of how they came to love Liverpool FC. Even though the team, like him, had fallen on hard times, he knew that he had his fellow supporters to walk with him. This was his team. 

Now, this man has a new dream, or more factually a pair of them. His overarching dream is to manage his beloved Reds. But, more practically, he has something he needs to take care of first. In time, he hopes to finally leave his homeland, and make the long flight across the Atlantic. When he gets to England, he has no interest in London. He has one destination: that working class city in the North. He wants to go to the place they call Anfield, walk through the Shankly gates, and sit in the Kop and stare out at the greatest expanse of grass on God's Green Earth. From there he will sing till his lungs are sore, and cheer on the heroes wearing red, because after all, just like him and any other one of the thousands present and millions worldwide, will have their ups and their downs, but they'll never walk alone.

I'm new to the show, I began watching about two weeks ago, but I'm completely hooked.  I started with the 2005 reboot and I just finished watching The Doctor's Daughter from season 4 (so no spoilers, please!).

I'm asking because this is the sort of thing that's hard to gather, especially while trying to avoid spoilers.  I'd like to assess my opinion of the episodes I've seen against the general consensus, and I also like knowing what to look forward to as I keep watching.  I looked at the episodes nominated for the Hugo awards, does everyone generally agree that those selected were the best of the season?  And what about doctors 1-8?  What are the high and low points?

So I know this is kind of a weird question, but I just want to get my bearings in this fandom, which is difficult to do because of the huge number of episodes, my non-Britishness, and my desire to avoid spoilers.

I want to know, however, just how this ""time lock"" works.  The Time War was locked by The Doctor, yes?  It basically removed all participants from... well, everything, it seems.  

So, my two-part question, for the clever Whovians, begins as such: How unique is The Doctor?  Should we expect that all Time Lords flitted about time and space, righting wrongs and such?  If this is the case, shouldn't The Doctor meet other Time Lords?  Even though they are all locked in the Time War surely he would meet some before they join the war, right?  

Does the ""Lock"" remove the participants of the Time War even from their (for lack of better terms) earlier and previous exploits?  The only other option, as near as I can tell, is that The Doctor is rather unusual in his adventures.  Perhaps other Time Lords take a rather ""hidden"" approach.

However, I know that there are many people (like me) who like to waste copious amounts of time reading/watching/doing whatever they can get their hands on, if it relates to the series they enjoy ever so much. It is in that regard that i post this somewhere on the internet (this seemed as good a place as any)

So. where to start? one day I was watching TV with my uncle and he offhandedly mentioned waiting for the 7th series in a show called Dr. Who. When i said i had never seen it he was surprised, and even a little disappointed, saying that he had been a fan since the 70s. He usually knows what's good and whats not, so i googled it, glanced over the wikipedia and revved up the ol' netflix.

It was at this point that i got into the show (2005 series) and...holy hell. This was great. Awesome plots, some of the cheesiest aliens of anything, ever, the time traveling lets the show take place anywhere, at anytime, on any made up planet the show writers could need, the show's topic of aliens reminds me of the picture of the [""alien professional""](http://i.qkme.me/35o3vr.jpg) from ancient aliens (Ghost? Werewolves? themotherfuckingDEVIL? noop, aliens. all aliens.), but the best part of the show had to be the characters. The Doctor was flat out awesome. He was a bad mammajamma and just kind of wandered about, trying to learn as much as he can while helping and teaching people, which sounds very appealing to me. Rose was a really likable character, too, and a fish out of water, which helped with explaining things without a break of pacing in the show. Watching the relationship between Rose and The Doctor grow while watching the relationship between Rose and Micky or Rose and her mother go under obvious stress is what really hooked me in and made the show's episodes feel connected instead of a bunch of random circumstances being thrown on the same characters with no consequence from one episode to the next. THOSE are who drew me in, the 9th Doctor and Rose.... So I started to really like the characters... then the finale of the first season hit. This is where the first snag in the show really came, and to my understanding, there wasn't really anything that could of been done differently. If Eccleston decided to quit then they HAD to replace him. But why does the doctor change so dramatically? Why does his personality have to change with his body? He seems like an almost entirely different person with the memories of someone else. I know the differences are mostly slight and more in the way he carries himself then the words he says and actions he does, but the small details kind of matter when it's supposed to be the same exact person in a different body. That's my first real complaint about the show. the 10th doctor is by no means a bad actor or anything, but why are the doctors so different? I think the 10th doctor is better while walking around and getting excited about...history things. But he doesn't carry the same weight that the 9th doctor did when it came down to the really important confrontations. He's just kind of hard to take seriously, and it seems to be by the choice of Tennant in how he acts. What makes a series effective is whether you care about what's happening, and with the Doctor changing body and personallity, that's kind of hard to care about. Iunno. kind of bummed out to be honest. just sat down and watched the first two seasons with very little break, and with the loss of BOTH of my two favorite characters I'm a little weary on starting the third.

Anyways. Thanks for wasting your time with me. Tell me why I'm wrong. Or right. Or how apparently the 4th doctor is better then 9 and 10 combined and i should be watching the classics or something. peace",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Thoughts from a newcomer,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/w8rtz/thoughts_from_a_newcomer/

Since then, after being a little disenchanted with my country's own league (the a-league in Australia) I looked to Europe to find a club I would want to follow. After watching a couple of years of the premier league, I found myself transfixed by watching this small winger takes on defenders and speed around the pitch. Although there were many other amazing reasons that led to me to become a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur, the man that sealed the deal for was Aaron Lennon, as I fell in love with his play.

Since finding this subreddit about six months ago though, I haven't seen that many positive comments in Lennon's favour and recently, a lot of talk has been around finding a replacement on the right wing. I just wanted to know what keeps Lennon back from being an absolute top-class first choice right wing player? Also, do you think he will have a place in AVB's tactical setup?

And exterminated him.

Let us go then, you and I,

While the evening is spread out against the sky

Like a prisoner exterminated upon a table.

That is not who I exterminated at all.

In the room the Daleks come and go

Exterminating Michelangelo

Then love, let us exterminate each other

For we are here as on a darkling plain

swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight 

where rebel Dalek factions clash by night.

I want an eyestalk, an uncommon want

When every assembly-period seems to bring forth another

Of the Doctor's first disobedience I sing,

And all the times he kicked our polycarbide arses...

For some background, this beer is by [Natural Selection Brewing](http://www.naturalselectionbrewing.com/), and is made my postgraduate brewing students from Heriot-Watt University. Anorak itself is a 4.8% hoppy wheat beer with citrus hop aroma and low bitterness.

My boyfriend is moving to Edinburgh to do a PhD in September, he wants me to join him, now I'm in the process of finishing an MSc and currently work part time to pay for noms and outings (I'm living with parents and he works full time for a research company).  So, yes, obviously if I join him I will need to find work there so my questions are:

Is getting a job easy? I used to live in Aberdeen and could easily get a new job within a month, is it like that for Edinburgh too?

Also are there many opportunities for medical science grads? Does Edinburgh have research companies?  I'm applying at Edinburgh uni for research positions but not getting much luck at the moment.  

Also I live between London and Oxford at the moment, I'm looking for science work pretty much everywhere, don't want to make a mistake of moving up North if the jobs i'm after are going to be all down South

With BR being less than reassuring about his prospects for us this year, I think it may not be such a bad idea.

When you look at the type of payer Carroll is and what he could become and achieve, you cannot look any further than Zlatan Ibrahimovic. At Liverpool, there is only Suarez to look at and Carroll will never be a Suarez, but if Carroll could become half the player Zlatan is with ball at feet, when considering his already impressive holding up and heading ability, we could have a monster on our hands. And what team wouldn't start Ibrahimovic?

Dempsey not at Fulham training.

Sky reports Dempsey has signed.

The Liverpool website allegedly (could be photoshopped) added [Dempsey to the roster momentarily](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/484634_420801051291306_1002165843_n.jpg). 

American owners + American sponsor + Best American player is obviously appealing.

LFC's market exposure in the US would shoot through the roof.

Not to mention the upcoming US tour where he could be displayed..

Thoughts?

If we are to sign someone this week, it has to be Borini, Ramirez or Dempsey I would think.

**Summary of rumours**

**IN**

Rodgers decides to play with our heartstrings by declaring his expectation that the first signing will be completed this week [during this press conference](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/rodgers-s-transfer-hope)

BBC made me change my pants by declaring it to be [Fabio Inzaghi Borini.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18773700)

In the meantime, an allegedly photoshopped picture has made a [website booboo become an announcement for Clint Dempsey](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/484634_420801051291306_1002165843_n.jpg). [Sky Sports](https://twitter.com/SSNRadio/status/222355853334945793) seems to support this idea. 

While the Italians and Uruguayan press are sure Ramirez is coming to Liverpool, the [Liverpudlians](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2012/07/09/gaston-ramirez-to-liverpool-fc-rumours-wide-of-the-mark-100252-31352262/) are not so sure. Maybe the word Liverpool means something entirely different in Italian. 

[The first signing for Liverpool was unveiled during an exclusive meet and greet with privileged Liverpool fans.](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/mighty-red-delights-kids)

**OUT**

Jay Spearing has taken the rumours of Carroll's departure hard, he [is going on loan to Blackburn Rovers](http://bleedsbluenwhite.com/index.php/rovers/news/126-spearing-a-target#.T_srGZUjxIY.reddit)

Andy Carroll's place in the team is in danger because [Rodgers says he will assess him like every other player in the squad.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9387686/Liverpool-manager-Brendan-Rodgers-suggests-Andy-Carroll-could-go-out-on-loan-if-he-fails-to-establish-himself.html)

[Fenerbahce are taking a long hard look at Aquilani.](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alberto-aquilani-to-fenerbahce-as-liverpool-look-1134906) [Aquilani says I do.](http://lfctransferspeculations.com/alberto-aquilani-absent-due-to-wedding/)

Maxi might submit a transfer request to become an Old Boy. Or he might stay here. 

If you're confused, Twitter is your friend. 

**EDIT: BREAKING NEWS!**

[ROMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/wbo4n/roma_confirm_that_we_want_borini/) has confirmed that Liverpool has made an official bid and that they are considering the bid.

**EDIT 2: GRIPE OF THE DAY**
It is hilarious how we are STILL being linked to Swansea players even after it was revealed that Rodgers agreed an embargo on their players. 

Also, for those quoting all those ITK's about Carroll, its amusing how there was absolutely nothing mentioned about Carroll before that stupid Milan quote but now every one of them claim that they have been ITK about Carroll for a while. 

**EDIT 3: BREAKING BREAKING NEWS**

Jakub Blaszczykowski, or KUBA for people with one tongue, is reportedly on our radar. His agent, and SSN, have reported that we have enquired for his services. 

Take that, those who've been complaining about lack of transfer action for Liverpool!

**EDIT 4: THE NEWS KEEPS ON BREAKING**

Let's defend ourselves against the English Defence League! 

The EDL are marching in Bristol on the 14th of July. The counter- mobilisation is in full swing, so get involved. There have been alot of posts on Bristol Indymedia about the EDL demo. Now is the time for our call to action. . Stay alert. Stay mobile. Bring your mates 

There are many many ways to show your opposition to the EDL: don't let them march, don't give 'em a lift in your taxi, put posters up in shops, don't serve them drinks, raise awareness about their farcical attempts to disguise their homophobia, chat to work colleagues, decorate the city.... do whatever you feel comfortable with but now is the time to get a crew together and take action against racism in our city. 

We want to meet them at the station to stop them marching for any distance. We will resist them wherever they turn and we will be watching them. Let's defend ourselves against the EDL! Zero tolerance of fascism on our streets.

For the last year we were with Plusnet. 50GB Limit, 1-2Mb speed and free evening and weekend calls for £50 a month, yes outrageous but it was really the only option as we didnt have a line into the house and plusnet (somehow) sorted this out for free. I think £15 line rental, £25 for the service and an extra £10 rural charge cause they were using BTs exchange.

He can't get TV reception where he is so was constantly using iplayer and streaming sites. This made him often go over the limit by about 10-15GB a month and for each 5GB he would get charged £5. 

So this was getting beyong annoying and I noticed the contract was nearly up, I phone the only other provider in the area (BT) they said the would offer unlimited internet with the free calls for £40. So I phoned up plusnet to request a mac code, they put me through to cancellations (otherwise known internally as ""customer retention""). 

It went like this

Me: I would like a mac code please

Them: OK no problem, may I ask who you are transferring to?

Me: Yes, BT, they are offering unlimited for £10 cheaper than you.

Them: Hold on one sec i'll see if I can get you a better deal / Because you have been with us for a year and you are a valued customer we can do you a better deal of unlimited with calls for £25 a month on a rolling contract so you can cancel anytime.

Me: Deal done!

Then when I went onto my plusnet account I see that i have been given a ""generic discount"". So I guess my point is you should do this with every service provider you have when your contract is near up, they want to keep customers. I would definitely do this with mobile phones. One thing to point out is plusnet have a record for very good customer service.

With our captain taking part in a courtroom farce which features a lot us c***s, let's look at what's happening in the world of Transfer Tittle Tattle

* First up [Jovetic](http://www.sport360.com/article/chelsea-arsenal-target-jovetic-available-%E2%82%AC30-million) who Fiorentina have admitted is available but only for €30mil Euros (does anyone know how to make the Euro symbol?) 

* Barca have an evil scheme to sign [Romeu](http://www.caughtoffside.com/2012/07/10/barcelona-plot-move-to-re-sign-chelsea-midfielder-oriol-romeu/) back, NOOOOOOOOO hands of you Catalonian c***s (I do hope there's no lip readers about)

* So many places stating that the [Oscar](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/9388957/Chelseas-signing-of-Oscar-will-bring-a-touch-of-class-to-Roberto-Di-Matteos-team.html) deal is done, the telegraph article linked here goes as far as to say we are now the premierships most exciting team,it also has a few videos of the young maestro.

* Of course it all depends who you believe [Oscar](http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/transfer-rumours/120710/brazilian-starlet-oscar-denies-he-has-agreed-%C2%A320m-chelsea-sw) himself is quoted in this article in a very non-commital fashion. Make up your mind son!

* According to a Bayer Leverkusen coach [Schurle](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/07/10/3232284/chelsea-target-schurrle-is-staying-at-leverkusen-says-coach) is not for sale, I'm not so sure, him or Hulk?

* United are in hard for [Lucas Moura](http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/159727.html?CMP=OTC-RSS#), is anyone else loosing track of all the brazilians we're trying to sign, I can't remember which is which, still better us than United...

* Meanwhile Anelka is getting desperate for [Drogba](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2171413/Nicolas-Anelka-rules-Premier-League-return.html) in China, speaking of China, I got my Arbitrary day gift from there today lovely it was a chelsea keyring and sticker as well as a tiny solar powered car!

**Kick-off, 6pm Celtic Park time**  

----

**Celtic** open their pre-season campaign tonight with a game against Bundesliga side FC Augsburg. The Germans were widely tipped to be relegated last season but in the end finished 14th just above St Pauli’s dreaded rivals Hamburg. Lenny will be hoping the Bhoys get off to a flyer tonight as this is likely the standard of opposition coming up in the Champions League 3rd qualifying round.

Kayal is hungry to get back to his best according to the Celtic website and Joe Ledley has said Kris Commons is looking the sharpest after their holidays. Hopefully Commons 2.0 has no more than fire in the belly department this year. Absentees are Adam Matthews with a slight hamstring pull and Izaguirre, Ki, Lustig, Bangura. Wanyama and Samaras who are all still on international break.

Video streams are looking sparse at the minute but if you come across a decent stream feel free post it in the comments. Also, according to the club the game won’t be live on Celtic TV but subscribers will get highlights tomorrow.

The best hope for live coverage seems to be this site.

And what better time than now? The club is entering a whole new era, it seems, and we could be there to witness it.

If we go as a group it wouldn't only be more fun, it could be cheaper, too.

I think the October 20th home match vs. Chelsea would be perfect! It's sure to be a great match high in pride and tension. We do have a score to settle, and I know AVB will line up something amazing.

I'm in Baltimore, and I've really only looked at plane tickets from there and Philly. They run around $800 for a round trip ticket (I haven't done deep trip planning yet) but we may, if enough people bite, be able to get discounts through a travel agent.

This wouldn't just be limited to East Coasters, it's just easier for us since the major airports in the area are driving distance. We could extend the interest nation wide if those fans living on the west and in the south would like to come.

EDIT 1: the Villa match on the 7th would also be a good option. Columbus day adds another day to our trip, so we're not as rushed. Opinions?

In the episode, we're told that Pete Tyler's survival because of Rose's intervention creates a paradox and that those reaper creatures come to ""heal the wound in time."" But we disagreed over the reason the creatures appeared. Here are the two sides:

* 1) Pete Tyler's death is a fixed point in time, therefore when Rose saves him, a fixed point has been altered and the reaper creatures come to heal the wound in time because there is now a man living in the world whose death was a fixed point in time but didn't occur.

or


* 2) Rose Tyler travels back in time to the day her dad gets hit by a car and dies. She then saves him from that car, which means that the future Rose Tyler would never travel back in time to the day he dies in order to save him. (This is the opposite of the grandfather paradox, where if you travel back in time to kill your grandfather, you would never be born and could not then go back in time to kill your grandfather.) So the reaper creatures come to heal the wound in time created by the paradox of Rose saving her father which means that she would then not be able to travel back in time to save her father.

Now, this episode doesn't say that Pete's death was a fixed point in time, but some people are making the argument that there is a strong implication that it is, and it even says this on the Doctor Who Wiki. After all, we've seen what happens when a fixed point is altered in Series 6 [spoiler](/s ""when River Song doesn't kill The Doctor and time starts disintegrating""). But this episode was also before modern Doctor Who started talking about fixed points and time being in flux, and after all, if a fixed point is altered, shouldn't the outcome always be the same? Could Pete Tyler's death by a *minor* fixed point in time that would cause the reapers to come instead of [spoiler](/s ""time disintegrating"")? 

I argued that a fixed point is a fixed point, and none can be altered, and so the reaper creatures were a result of the grandfather type paradox I outlined in #2. But I was having a real hard time getting them to let go of the idea that Pete Tyler's death was a fixed point in time.

To be honest, I just want to move to a different location. Hopefully a location with prospects of me getting some sort of apprenticeship or a full time job and a place to keep my equine companion. The job isn't so important, as long as it is full time, the area itself doesn't even have to have 5 star reviews, a town centre would be lovely, but I would prefer somewhere away from teenages with sharp objects and gun type things. However, the place I keep my horse is important, I need a place with decent facilities (Stables, grazing, schooling area/arena, electricity and running water). 

As for my current situation, I'm a 21 year old female, working part time in a Supermarket, with no hope of finding a full time job in the chav ridden town I live in. My horse is stuck on an old landfill site, that has been bodged into a stable yard, that possibly Stig of dump might have built. 

So, I come to you reddit. If you have any ideas of a location for me to move, that meets most of the criteria, feel free to share. If this fails, I'm going to throw darts at a map and go as the wind may take me.

Disappointedly there seems to be no streams available for this one at all.

Laura Brannan's tweets [@celticfc](http://twitter.com/celticfc) is the best source to keep up to date with the game

----

**6 mins** Forster makes the first save of the evening six minutes in before Musona has a chance to knock it into the net.

**9 mins** Two more chances for Augsburg, Knowledge Musona and Marcel de Jong look dangerous.

**14 mins** Great save from Forster and K. Wilson clears the danger for a corner which then comes to nothing.

**16 mins** Forrest swaps with McGeouch. The captain is now on the right wing, McGeouch is behind the strikers.

**22 mins** The change has worked well, Celtic are making a lot more promising runs forward.

**28 mins** Augsburg miss a sitter after K. Wilson fails to pass back to Forster quick enough. Moravek shot wide of the open goal.

**41 mins** Hooper makes his first good move in front of goal but a tackle stops him from pulling the trigger.

**Half-time in Germany** Augsburg 0 Celtic 0 ...it hasn't been a classic.

**45 Mins** The second half kicks off. Augsburg 0 Celtic 0

Exciting start to the second half, Celtic look like they have a lot more heart and bite but then Forster pulls off a good double save.

**60 mins** Paddy McCourt replaces James Forrest. Ledley takes the armband. Still 0-0.

**63 mins** Daryl Murphy replaces Gary Hooper.

**66 mins** Blackman is booked for a bad tackle.

**70 mins** Celtic's best chance of the game - Murphy hits the post.

**72 mins** Double substitution for Celtic. Lewis Toshney replaces Anthony Stokes and Tony Watt comes on for Beram Kayal. Still 0-0.

**87 mins** Celtic push forward, they look desperate for a winner but nothing is coming off for them.

Disappointedly there seems to be no streams available for this one at all.

Laura Brannan's tweets [@celticfc](http://twitter.com/celticfc) is the best source to keep up to date with the game

----

**6 mins** Forster makes the first save of the evening six minutes in before Musona has a chance to knock it into the net.

**9 mins** Two more chances for Augsburg, Knowledge Musona and Marcel de Jong look dangerous.

**14 mins** Great save from Forster and K. Wilson clears the danger for a corner which then comes to nothing.

**16 mins** Forrest swaps with McGeouch. The captain is now on the right wing, McGeouch is behind the strikers.

**22 mins** The change has worked well, Celtic are making a lot more promising runs forward.

**28 mins** Augsburg miss a sitter after K. Wilson fails to pass back to Forster quick enough. Moravek shot wide of the open goal.

**41 mins** Hooper makes his first good move in front of goal but a tackle stops him from pulling the trigger.

**Half-time in Germany** Augsburg 0 Celtic 0 ...it hasn't been a classic.

**45 Mins** The second half kicks off. Augsburg 0 Celtic 0

Exciting start to the second half, Celtic look like they have a lot more heart and bite but then Forster pulls off a good double save.

**60 mins** Paddy McCourt replaces James Forrest. Ledley takes the armband. Still 0-0.

**63 mins** Daryl Murphy replaces Gary Hooper.

**66 mins** Blackman is booked for a bad tackle.

**70 mins** Celtic's best chance of the game - Murphy hits the post.

**72 mins** Double substitution for Celtic. Lewis Toshney replaces Anthony Stokes and Tony Watt comes on for Beram Kayal. Still 0-0.

**87 mins** Celtic push forward, they look desperate for a winner but nothing is coming off for them.

Shock horror!  No doubt the tabloids are dusting down their broken Celtic crest already and Stewart Regan's already working in the lack of tonights TV coverage to his latest doomsayers lament.

Regardless there are lot of positives to draw from the match. Celtic walked off the field with a clean sheet against a Bundesliga side away from home. Not only that but they achieved this without Brown, Ki, Izaguirre, Commons, Matthews, Rogne, Wanyama or Samaras with (even younger) youngsters placed in their stead.

The emergence of McGeouch, Twardzik, Toshney, Watt and of course, James Forrest show that the future really is green and white. Hopefully against the Stuttgart Kickers I'll be able see or even hear the future too. Tweets are just not the way you want to follow a Celtic match.

It says that International members are not eligible for priority access to tickets. So Im guessing my choices are between Light and Full

My first question is what is the difference between Full and Light membership (aside from one being around $70 US and the other being around $40 US)

My second question is how likely am I to get a ticket to, say, Home vs. Reading on October 20?

Also how likely am I to get a ticket to the Merseyside Derby on the 27th?

I came up with the following order (shout out to this previous post: http://i.imgur.com/6F39g.jpg). I wanted to show her some good ones first, but feel free to comment on those and recommend others.


* Rose
* Smith and Jones
* The Runaway Bride
* A Good Man Goes to War
* Let's Kill Hitler
* The Wedding of River Song
* The Impossible Astronaut
* Day of the Moon
* The Pandorica Opens
* The Big Bang
* The Time of the Angels
* Flesh and Stone
* Silence in the Library
* Forest of the Dead
* The Eleventh Hour (because it's awesome, and I did the other companion introduction episodes)


I think this order works fairly well as a story in its own right. In a Good Man Goes to War we see Rory as a Roman and the Doctor speaking baby. In LKH we get some Amy and Rory backstory (and why I did not have her introductory episode before the River sequence) and previews of the Doctor dying and such. In both A Good Man and Pandorica we get the perspective of the Doctor as a bad guy to many groups. We get the Angels and brief introductions to Daleks, Sontarans, and Cybermen. And at the end, River dies, which is a fitting way to end her story, plus a new Doctor!

The only bad part is (I haven't seen any spoilers, this is just assumption), I don't believe we're done with River in the next series, so we're probably missing some of her stuff (crossing fingers for Jim the Fish!). But, that's not the worst thing in the world. I've thought about just starting with A Good Man, but I think it's too intense without some lighter introductory stuff.

So, any recommendations on what to change with my plan?? Thanks for any input!


**tl;dr**: Introducing a friend to Doctor Who with several stand-alones and then doing River's timeline from her perspective (as much as possible).

I think this is a really healthy way for the community to operate - through conversations rather than through headlines which we try our best not to editorialise. Text only means we can steer clear of editorialised headlines but we can still have a good conversation about each piece of news and frame it in a way that's interesting and relevant. If people needed to include a link, they always can do, but it gives everyone a foundation on which we can build better conversations and get to know each other better?

Also, it means that we can talk *about* the topics of the day more without having to link to The Daily Mail or some other god awful publication.

UPDATE: For anyone interested I told my friend of the places you mentioned but they said no to them as they hadn't heard of places like 'Start the Bus' or 'The Old Duke' so didn't trust them.  So I went on my friends advice (who lives near Bristol btw) and went to a place on Park Street called The Ram. It was pretty horrible. The place was heaving, toilets disgusting, people rude, and the ale on tap was off. Two drinks later and we went to a place called 'The White Hart'. It was even worse and disgusting. Finally we went across the road to 'The Woods' which was far better but had no ales on tap :-/ Finally we went to some bar on Park Street that had a magician at the back doing tricks.

So I live in Southville but now my bf has moved in, it's a bit small so early next year we are looking to move into a house.

Criteria:

Walking distance from Temple Meads (he works in Bath)

Walking distance from town (I work near the Colston hall). Nether of us drive.

Three bedrooms ideally, but 2 spacious ones would do

A garden

Budget of about up to 800-900 per month.

Any idea where we should be looking?

While his age is certainly a factor in this, he has had scoring success in the Premier League, albeit with a club where he is a focal point and which brings with it far less pressure.

However, the key problem I have with the situation is this. We haven't made the Champions League in years. We think of ourselves as a global team, but we're not as much as we could be. We have a reputation in Europe and a surprisingly strong reputation in Southeast Asia, but we've been slipping. At a point in history where the sport is gaining traction in the United States (the country which spends far more on sports than any other, see the Super Bowl), we can't even qualify for the primary club event that is shown there. This means no Champions League revenue AND far less expansion revenue in a free-spending country due to lack of exposure. Dempsey would be a fantastic way to change the latter, and is good enough to help in the former, though that one at least is not something he could do alone.

Perhaps signing him wouldn't be a purely footballing move, but I personally think that it would be a fantastic business move, helping us penetrate the fastest-growing market in a way that sets us up for better footballing moves later.

Uruguay started playing quite badly and were 0-2 down in the first 10 minutes. However, they got back on track with an assist from Ramirez to Suarez scoring 1-2. Then a fantastic play and goal by Suarez for the 2-2. In the next 3 minutes Uruguay were winning 3-2 with a penalty scored by Cavani at the minute 39 of the first half.

**Update:** First half just ended, score remains 3-2.

**Second Half:**

**[2']** **GOOOAAL** Suarez scores again right at the beginning of the seconf half!! That's a hat-trick for *El Depredador*!! Ramirez with the assist

**[6']** Uruguay's dominating this second half and Suarez almost scored his fourth goal with a header, assisted by Cavani.

**[19']**: 10 Ramírez, Calzada and Urretaviscaya **OUT**. Lodeiro, Aguirregaray and D. Rodríguez **IN**. I'm sure Tabarez wants to test different teams before the Olympics; though Ramirez wasn't at his best, he gave two assists to Suarez

**[26']** Suarez **OUT**, Abel *La Joya* Hernandez **IN**. *Cacha* Ejidio Arévalo Ríos is now the captain.

**[27']** **GOOAAAAL!** Cavani scores his second one with an assist from Aguirregaray. It's **5-2** now

**[28']** Rolín **OUT**, Polenta **IN**

**[32']** Cavani **OUT**, Tabaré Viudez **IN**

**[35']** **GOOOAAL** by Chile`s Sebastián Ubilla. **Uruguay 5-3 Chile**

**[40]** **GOOOAAAAL** fantastic one by Abel Hernandez, running alone and chipping it over the goalkeeper. The ball got in with quite a lot of suspense, slowly and hitting the post. **Uruguay 6-3 Chile**

**[46']** **GOOOOAALL** great one, again by Sebastian Ubilla for Chile.

**End of Match: Uruguay 6-4 Chile**

Ok so it was a match full of goals. Uruguay started playing quite badly and Chile dominated within the first 15 minutes. Neither of the teams played well; but without doubts Uruguays olympic team has a lot of potential, its attack is one to be afraid of with Suarez, Cavani, Ramirez, Hernandez and Viudez. Defensively the team has really good players with Coates and Rolin among others but the team wasn't quite organised; hope they can solve that towards the games in London.

Here's the [**whole first half**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-6Eccq9Mv8) of the match and here's the [**second half**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2LWD5r-maw) (sorry for the shitty quality, couldn't find a better one)

It stops at Clifton, Redland, Montpelier, Stapleton Road, Lawrence Hill and Temple Meads. Also, at less busy times, you'll often never meet a ticket inspector. Of course you wanna be careful travelling without a ticket, but you know what I'm saying. Anyway, it's only £1.50 for any journey!

The beauty of it is that it cuts right across the 'spokes' of Whiteladies Road and Gloucester Road, giving you a trajectory not served by any bus route :)
