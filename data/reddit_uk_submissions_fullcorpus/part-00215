This is disgraceful news. 

I just want to give my perspective on this, as I used to frequent Fabric many years ago as well as many other underground events (some legal, some not). This isn't intended to be a negative post, but rather a credit to Fabric, the staff, and all the lives they've no doubt saved over the years by providing a safe environment for those who want to dance all night to music under the influence of drugs (drugs the government have chosen to make illegal and therefore dangerous).

Places like Fabric reduce harm. Fabric is located in a built up area where help is readily available, and their staff are second to none - door staff, medical staff - all of them. Although Fabric's official policy on drugs is obviously ""no"", anyone who exists in the real world knows electronic music and drugs go hand in hand, therefore an official venue whose soul purpose is to host cutting edge electronic talent WILL be a sanctuary for drug enhanced dancing.

It's true that the people who died at Fabric wouldn't have died if Fabric didn't exist, but this is a total red herring. Making Fabric a less attractive option simply encourages individuals to attend less-safe, possibly illegal events elsewhere, some absent of any professional staff whatsoever. Many of these are lives saved by Fabric's presence, but the myopic view of the authorities who must give the nod to harm-causing policies just aren't interested in considering this perspective. 

In my experience Fabric is no doubt one of the safest environments I've ever been where there were hundreds of people dancing all night on every drug imaginable. Readily available free water there - and plenty of space outside if you need it. Many other underground events I've been to would actually shut off the water in the toilets preventing you from being able to fill a cup or bottle, forcing you to spend £2 on a new one. And should you become ill from an overdose at many of these places you'd be turfed out on to the streets.

So Fabric isn't closing, it's been ""saved"". But at what expense? Those who are serious about dancing, taking drugs, and not getting caught, will simply avoid Fabric now, possibly in favor of an far less safe venue or event.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,"World famous London nightclub, Fabric, to bring in sniffer dogs after being saved from closure (link to report inside)",80,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2pzyg5/world_famous_london_nightclub_fabric_to_bring_in/

On Thursday a letter arrived telling me that I've got a pre-surgery assessment by phone tomorrow (Monday) afternoon but didn't mention when the surgery was going to be. 

On Friday I got another letter saying that the surgery would be performed on New Year's eve, at 11am. 

Firstly that's not much notice, given the time I've been waiting, but, what I'm finding more concerning is the day. I have this (probably unjustified) fear that I'll be going in and be looked after by people who can't wait to get the hell out of there so they can go and get drunk.

This is a private hospital, but I'm going through the NHS. 

I know there are obviously people who go in on that day as emergencies or are already there with something long-term but going in as a day patient seems unusual and I'm quite nervous. 

Ha anyone heard of this before? How was it? Should I just stop being daft and get it over with?

I did try to speak to the right people at the hospital on Friday but at 3 pm, they'd already gone home! I'll be calling again tomorrow.

edit:
&amp;nbsp;

Forgot I could edit my post so I'll paste my comment from below 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I'd like to apologise.

&gt;I'm a serial worrier. I worry about anything and everything, to the point where it has become unhealthy.  

&gt;At the time of posting I was starting to wonder if I'd been offensive to the wonderful staff who are working over the festive period, but I then thought about my father and the time he had in a hospital on the day before, and on a bank holiday, and I became very worried again :(

&gt;To quote another post:
&gt;&gt;However, a few years ago, my father went into hospital the day before a bank holiday - it was terrible, by the end of the day, there was hardly a soul on the ward, and on the bank holiday itself, due to lack of care, several problems occurred because he wasn't checked on frequently enough, then when the problems were discovered, there was nobody to help!


&gt;Once again, I apologise unreservedly, and wish any hospital workers a wonderful Christmas!

&gt;I'd like this to be the top comment in this thread so if you could all upvote it, it'd be greatly appreciated.

If you *do* want to post a full review then of course go right ahead but if you just want to say ""hey smoked a Boli Petit Corona last night and it was great!"" then that's very welcome too.

So to start,  I smoked a Jamie Garcia Especial belicosco tonight paired with [doorly's](http://www.masterofmalt.com/rum/doorlys/doorlys-3-year-old-rum/?srh=1) and coke. I had the robuso version of this a week or two ago and of the two I think I prefer the Belicosco. That might however be down to smoking the Robusto a bit too soon. I'm not great at picking out flavours but there was definitely a lot of pepper in there along with something that was either chocolate or leather trying to get through (again I'm really terrible at picking out flavours in cigars).

Thoroughly enjoyed the series, stories, camera work and emotional pull were all top drawer, but theres some things I can't get my head around that are bugging me.

#1 - The Morrocan guy who got killed in the prison. Would it make sense that the Romanian who supposedly killed/sold Olly had friends on the inside, and didn't want the truth to come to light?

#2 The journalist. We never did find out what his findings were from the Borgue interview, and who he ultimately thought was responsible.

#3 Olly alive or dead? (obviously)
I found on a similar thread a picture of Olly before/after in a newspaper, the picture of future Olly and the kid who answered the door both looked very similar. Also does the kid not respond in French? Or Romanian even? Could be totally wrong on that one but last I checked the Father didn't know Russian but had a decent idea of French.

Perhaps it is all left open to interpretation or it will be hinted in the next season, what are your thoughts?

I can understand children stereotyping Danny, but other teachers, including Clara, and even the Doctor are being incredibly reductive about the entire subject. His former career automatically makes him a bloodthirsty, callous, inferior grunt/meathead in their eyes. Is there a cultural explanation for this? Or is it just lazy writing?

The main thing that could stick out would be my Epiphone electric guitar:

It could also be with my Roland cube 60 amp, which you can just see behind it in the photo. (http://i.imgur.com/E6kkYt5.jpg)

Another thing that might stick out is my Dell 22.5"" touch monitor. You can see it in my house here, http://i.imgur.com/5saCtxP.jpg
Here's a stock photo for reference, http://i.imgur.com/j8WbsJf.jpg

My girlfriends laptop looks like this, http://i.imgur.com/zefvWKH.jpg It's bright pink and is only a couple of weeks old (just got it for her birthday) so it should look almost new.

There are a load of other things too but I don't think they're really unique enough to be worth posting images but here's a quick list of some of the other stuff were missing: two Silver Sony Vaio Laptops, a Sigma 70mm-300mm camera lens, a HTC 8S (black), a 23"" TV (can't remember the make), GHD Straighteners, a couple of curling irons, a silver compact digital camera, a Gameboy SP and a load of random jewelry.

**Description**

I am in my second year of studying Photography at a London University.

I have over 5 years of experience as photographer and I am proud to say that I built myself a decent portfolio.

I am an expert user of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom because I post-process and retouch all my images. I can retouch, modify and composite images in different styles and for different applications (high fashion, landsacpe, product, portrait, collage, etc). My main goal is to obtain beautiful and consistent results which satisfy different people.

I am very flexible and professional, I can photograph you, your event and your product. If you like my work, do not hesitate to contact me!

Have a wonderful day!

Wallace, Kalas, Feruz, Chalobah, and Omeruo among a few others are probably not going to make Mourinho's quality cut back into rotational consideration unfortunately. And the Marin's, McEachran's, Moses', etc. of the world are as good as gone.

For me, the youth setup is where it gets exciting. The potential found here is tremendous and dense, arcane to those unexposed to the fluid and highly intelligent and expressive football these young boys play in glimpses. The cooperative flair is bound by technical proficiency and philosophical awareness that transcends these players ages. There are a few players I would like make it to the first team, either as regulars or role players within the next 2-4 seasons. I'm focusing mostly on the two that I think will be our biggest and brightest stars in the years to come.

**Charly Musonda:** My favorite prospect in all of our ranks. Charly was signed from his native Belgium club RSC Anderlecht in June 2012 despite heavy interest from Barcelona and Manchester City. He just turned 18 years of age (born 15 October 1996) and rapidly progressed from U-16 fixtures as a 15 year old academy player to a regular in Dermot Drummy's U-21 side by an impressive 17 years of age. Charly is a rare breed, he is gifted and talented in similar capacities that the greatest to ever play this game were in their youths; highly intelligent and poised, tight control with the ball at his feet, an uncanny ability to create chances for himself with pace, an eye for goal when appropriate chances arrive, a boot to finesse home his penetrative runs or a club to hammer home long range shots with equal affinity. Charly also boasts impressive space recognition after cleverly orchestrated one-two interchanges, quick bursts of acceleration and turning of opponents with high efficiency, proficient awareness of teammate's positioning and off-ball runs, mesmerizing Hazard-esque not-from-this-planet ability to serpentine through flocks of coalescing defenders with incredible focus as if they weren't even there, etc., etc., etc. Halfway through this 2013/2014 season, he looks a player destined for the very top with mature displays and a penchant for excellence in big moments (notably against Manchester United in the FA Cup youth final last season). This is becoming a more frequent part of his game. If he can continue on this developmental trajectory while gaining size and mass, I biased-ly predict Ballon d'Or levels of potential for one of Belgium's brightest talents. *knocks on wood*.

* This video shows all of Charly's touches against Sheffield United last season, as well as his goal that is very reminiscent to many we have seen from our other golden boy on the left wing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eB2-f5-744 


**Jeremie Boga:** My second-but-very-close-second favorite of our future prospects. Jeremie is a 17 year old French youth international who joined Chelsea as an under-12 and has experienced earlier and longer runs with the U-18 and U-21 sides than has Charly with his debut coming at just 15 years of age. Boga, like Musonda, is very technically proficient. Boga perhaps being more of a tactician than Charly, he is more of a ""#10"", the creative force that allows the opening of space for teammates through his sublime vision and readiness to pass. Jeremie also possesses unique qualities of a typical number 10 as he uses his low center of gravity coupled with intimate ball control and swift bursts of speed and acceleration that allow him to maneuver sinuously through opponents with elegance and pompous gusto. Once past defenders, he often looks to goal and has a very accurate and powerful shot for a young midfielder. Charly Musonda and Jeremie boga can be unpredictable at times due to youthful exuberance, but when their talent flashes it is a mesmerizing thing to witness. These two will go straight to the very top someday. Somebody tag me on this, I'm offering my sperm-bearing nut on this because I am that confident.

* This video shows Boga doing Boga things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAze6-afy68

Besides these two players, there are some others from our youth ranks that I think have the ability to carve a role in our team someday (barring they stay with Chelsea until they are old enough to be properly evaluated).


Probable: **Ruben Loftus-Cheek**, **Isaiah Brown**, **Andreas Christensen**, **Nathan Ake**, **Lewis Baker**, **Dominic Solanke**, **John Swift**.

Possible: **Ola Aina**, **Charlie Colkett**, **Alex Kiwomya**, **Kasey Palmer**, **Jay Dasilva**.


I know there are some things I missed, but I just posted this for discussion. If you believe I am underestimating someone, let me know! Tell me who you guys think are our brightest future prospects. KTBFFH.

Series nine I think the doctor will get clues about it from an unknown enemy(could be GUS) and this enemy leads the doctor on a wild goose chase of false hope,as in he thinks he has found Gallifrey when it's not Gallifrey actually it could be skaro or something and missy would be back  for revenge 

Series ten I'd have the doctor encounter something extremely wrong and in turn it leads to him discovering that omega is back and it's revealed that this is the person behind GUS all along and omega now has a big plan and the doctor is forced to find Gallifrey or let omega destroy the universe and then he finds Gallifrey and is sentenced 

Then there's some specials with 12th on Gallifrey with other timelords,like a mini children of earth type series and also Moffats finale series before he leaves and capaldis regeneration episode

As the title suggests I was in a car accident about 8 weeks ago. I was in the front passenger seat of the car at fault and as a result of the incident I now have mashed up tendons (I am unsure of the correct medical assessment as my ultrasound appointment is not until January). 

I am looking to claim from the driver at fault as I lost my job because of the incident (I was 5 months in to a 6 month probation, the company unfortunately and understandably were not willing to hang around and decided to find a replacement). 

I have contacted the at-fault drivers insurance company who kept me on hold and jumping between different extensions for a few hours (£25 phone call) before telling me the case had been moved over to their in house solicitor team as it was me contacting them and not a solicitor. I was told by the insurance dept I would be contacted that very day by said in-house solicitor team. I have yet to receive a call. 

I have no legal experience whatsoever and have (thankfully) never had to make an insurance claim so I feel a little out of my depth. 

Do I find a solicitor? Do I wait for the insurance companies solicitors to call? Am I being impatient? 

Any assistance is welcome, even if it is just an anecdote about your experience making an insurance claim. Thanks in advance!",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,I was a 3rd party in a car accident a couple of months ago and am unsure of proceedings.

Flying to London for one interview can easily be £400 (plane tickets, hotel, meals, etc), and there is no guarantee that the interview will result in an offer. I could potentially line up several interviews in one week, but if neither of them results in an offer, that's easily £800-£1000 wasted.

I could ask for reimbursement on the travel and hotel costs, however would they be willing to reimburse cost for person that has to fly in from mainland Europe, when they can just hire someone local?

Even if every company that invites me to an onsite interview covers all my costs, the process of flying to London, going to an interview then flying back home, only to repeat that in few days for different interview is not exactly what I want to do.

For me, the preferred solution would be a Skype/Google hangouts interview. If they give me an offer, I'd fly in, meet the team, sign some papers and start looking for a place to live. I have no problem paying for this part of the process, but only if I have something solid. Wasting money just to try interview is not something I want to do, I'd rather enrol to Master's studies here.

I've heard that you can get it from having a job lined up and I've also heard you can get the funding if you are definitely going to get it anyway...So do I need proof or can I just tell them I'm applying for it.

Need to get this information soon as right as I sort it all out they've put me on a course in which I've got 3 sanctions so far apparently.

1 for listening to music while job searching even though they said I could (later they told me i can only have 1 headphone in)
1 for closing my eyes after a 3 hour group conversation in which I'm completely knackard.
1 for listening to music with both headphones on during a break.

I need to get this license thing sorted asap.

Basically, I'm on the Work Programme and have an awful advisor who constantly pushes me to apply for vacancies that I don't want to go for because they're not what I want to be doing. I understand that I ought not to be choosy about what work I *am* willing to take, but there are a lot of retail vacancies and I hardly ever struggle to apply for 15 customer-facing roles every week. (Usually more like 20, and with the glut of Christmas vacancies, 25 has been easily achievable some weeks)

So, the other week, he pushed me to apply for a call centre vacancy - this is despite the fact that I'm not *great* with my hearing due to a bout of glue ear as a child, sometimes I just *don't hear*, I had it checked about 10 years ago and there was nothing *severely* wrong but my mother is deaf so perhaps it's somewhat hereditary. I find it difficult to hear in real life, and often have to ask people to repeat things, and on the phone I'm worse. I explained this but nope, still gotta go for it. I mainly applied just to get him to stop insinuating that I'm lazy, even though I do voluntary work that was arranged by myself. (As soon as I left college, I got myself into a charity shop before I even signed on and I've been there since.)

Just had a call asking me to fill in the emailed application form and go along tomorrow.

I don't have a hope of working in a call centre; targets stress me out, and I can't hear properly on the phone. There was no chance to explain all of this, all of the questions were, ""Are you good with computers?"" and, ""Are you okay with selling things?"" and it was all over so quick that I didn't have a chance to explain.

The woman who called me just emailed back to confirm my interview time, etc, and it's tomorrow - what can I do? I'm totally unsuitable for this job, should I just be honest? Should I call ahead and tell them I don't think I'm suitable?

I'm really worried that they might contact the Job Centre and tell them that I'm applying for jobs I can't do or that I'm turning down interviews but I didn't have much of a choice as my advisor threatens me with sanctions whenever I show the slightest hint of disagreeing with him so I'm really backed into a corner because if I'm sanctioned, I can't do *anything* - I wouldn't even be able to go and volunteer at the charity shop so it'd ruin me.

[Here's a picture of what kind of 2-&gt;1 lane merge I mean](http://i.imgur.com/hsE93kR.jpg)

Firstly, there are 2 lanes of traffic past a light-controlled junction which I was pulling out of - the traffic was pretty heavy. The left lane was completely full across the junction so I pulled into the right lane rather than block the main road when the light changed (no yellow hatches). Further down the road there's a merge point like the one I linked to.

Now, as far as I know, the general rule in these situations is that you merge in turn (or zip merge), so the car in front of me had picked a spot to merge into, so I positioned myself to merge behind the van behind him. Then comes the angry Porsche driver, who begins tailgating the van so as not to let me in. Originally I was going to just stay ahead of him and continue to merge, then let him drive into me if he wished as I was convinced it would be his fault in terms of insurance liability. Sadly (or maybe luckily) it's my girlfriends car and she didn't want to test my theory (that's not quite how she worded it...) so I eventually gave him the middle finger and dropped back (possibly with a few extra words thrown in).

So what I want to know: Who would've been at fault here if we had collided?

There are no lines to divide the lanes so as far as I'm concerned the person who gets priority is the one who is ahead at the merge point. I also think the ""yield to the right"" rule applies here - I'd be thrown into oncoming traffic otherwise.

I'd be interested in what people think.. I've looked at the highway code and can't find anything which gives a definitive answer, although rules [288](https://www.gov.uk/road-works-level-crossings-tramways-288-to-307/road-works-288) and [134](https://www.gov.uk/general-rules-all-drivers-riders-103-to-158/multilane-carriageways-133-to-143) do make me think I'm in the right here. Happy to be told I'm wrong too - will avoid getting myself in trouble in future!

I come from a small town in Sweden called Luleå, 1000km north of Stockholm and when I were younger my mum used to work as a receptionist at a medium sized hotel in the neighbouring town, Boden. During the years she worked there the local team in Boden, Boden BK, played their best football and were fighting in the second tier league here in Sweden, called ""Superettan"". Superettan is maybe comparable to League 2 and for some reason Tottenham decided to play a preseason-friendly against Boden during the summer of 2000. Here is news from the website regarding the match: 


[""The low down on Boden BK"".](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/the-low-down-on-boden-bk-240700/)

She said that it wasn't unusual that teams stayed the night at the hotel, but this time was different. Due to the risk of English Hooligans the bookings were handled differently and some ice hockey player was going to live there as well during the visit.

I hope this festive season is treating you all well. This is a quick reminder that there are some LAN related dates growing ever larger in our collective headlights.

* Epic.14 is now less than two months away (19th-22nd Feb) and winter epics have a terrible habit of selling out - those of you who are planning on coming please do get on with booking tickets at their [website](https://www.epiclan.co.uk/). Prize will rise with more signups so for those of you on the fence please do come, it's always a fun weekend and it'd be great to show these guys our support/thanks for supporting us. At time of posting 60%~ of the seats have gone so book soon to avoid disappointment - this includes those of you with free ticket vouchers from prior LANs; they do not guarantee you seats.

* i54 is still but a speck on the horizon (3rd-6th April), but early bird ticket sales close on the 6th January. For those of you who already have this LAN stamped on your calendars hitting this deadline will certainly save you some pennies so please do take advantage [here](http://insomniagamingfestival.com/tickets/). Prize pool info is still to be confirmed though I'm hearing that there will be tiered prizes triggered as more teams sign up as opposed to the fixed model of the year just finished.

PS can a mod edit the sidebar to advertise i54 not that event that happened last month.

PPS LAN stalwart Maccy got married a couple of days back, congratulations on being a functioning adult in this sea of degeneracy.

I come from a small town in Sweden called Luleå, 1000km north of Stockholm and when I were younger my mum used to work as a receptionist at a medium sized hotel in the neighbouring town, Boden. During the years she worked there the local team in Boden, Boden BK, played their best football and were fighting in the second tier league here in Sweden, called ""Superettan"". Superettan is maybe comparable to League 2 and for some reason Tottenham decided to play a preseason-friendly against Boden during the summer of 2000. Here is news from the website regarding the match: 


[""The low down on Boden BK"".](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/the-low-down-on-boden-bk-240700/)

She sais that it wasn't unusual that teams stayed the night at the hotel, but this time was different. Due to the risk of English Hooligans the bookings were handled differently and some ice hockey player was going to live there as well during the visit. This hockey player was no other than Peter Forsberg. Forsberg who recently got chosen to NHL's Hall of Fame is one of Sweden's biggest throughout history and were on top of his career during this visit.

I come from a small town in Sweden called Luleå, 1000km north of Stockholm and when I were younger my mum used to work as a receptionist at a medium sized hotel in the neighbouring town, Boden. During the years she worked there the local team in Boden, Boden BK, played their best football and were fighting in the second tier league here in Sweden, called ""Superettan"". Superettan is maybe comparable to League 2 and for some reason Tottenham decided to play a preseason-friendly against Boden during the summer of 2000. Here is news from the website regarding the match: 


[""The low down on Boden BK"".](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/the-low-down-on-boden-bk-240700/)

She said that it wasn't unusual that teams stayed the night at the hotel when playing against Boden BK, but this time was different. Due to the risk of English ""Hooligans"" the bookings were handled differently and some ice hockey player was going to live there as well during the visit. This hockey player was no other than Peter Forsberg. 

Forsberg who recently got chosen to NHL's Hall of Fame is one of Sweden's biggest throughout history and was on top of his career during this visit. Peter is a big Tottenham fan, that's why he visited. 

Even though my mum barely knew who this Peter was she asked for an autograph of him when he came to pay for his stay. She quietly asked for an autograph as a birthday present to my then 9 year old brother. He signed the paper and asked if she wanted anymore, but she declined. As a mother of two she soon realised that it was probably stupid to decline another autograph. Her workday continued and suddenly a colleague from the restaurant came with a guy who had taken a linen cloth from one of the tables at the restaurant. He had taken it to get autographs from the english team. The guy had to pay for the linen cloth, but my mother didn't care any more than that. 

My brother got Peter Forsbergs autograph as a birthday present and douchebag little 6 year old me apparently got upset that I didn't get one, and my mum felt bad that she didn't got another while she had the chance. 

Flash forward 3-4 year and my mum was on of her last University assignments, working together with a guy and a girl. They all visited each other homes during this class and as they visited the guy it came clear that he was of course the same guy as the linen cloth thief. He was a big Tottenham fan who had to meet the Spurs when they were in Sweden. 

For some reason my mum bought this linen cloth (now framed) from this guy as I had grew more and more interested in sports and for my 10th or 11th birthday I got it as a gift. 

[Here's the cloth](http://imgur.com/HM9zo4x)

My mum took note of all the players on it, and I think I sorted it out correctly with help of google. Unfortunately some of them has faded out, like Neil Sullivans and Les. 

1- Sol Campbell 

2- George Graham

3- Ian Walker

4- Neil Sullivan 

5- Peter Forsberg (Hence the #21)

6- Steffen Iversen

7- David Ginola

8- Chris Armstrong

9- Les Ferdinand 

10- Chris Armstrong (again?) 

* Extra Judas-pin included. 


When I got it I adored it because Peter Forsberg was included, as I weren't familiar with any Spurs players. But at that moment I started to like tottenham and apparently it was my Dad's old fav team as well. 


From there it took a while since I started supporting Spurs, mostly because I was a basketball-enthusiast and didn't watch more football than the occasional CL playoff games during spring. When I started catching up on watching football it didn't took long before I found /r/COYS and since then I can't get enough of this place. 

Merry Christmas and a Happy new year to everyone here at /r/COYS. 

TL;DR
Me ma smashed the linencloth thief and got me my not well deserved gift.

I'm assuming everything goes perfect and we would manage to sell all the players we want and also be able to realistically buy the players we would need.



**Out:**

1. *Brad Jones*: I like Brad but he isn't good enough to consistently be a threat to our number one Keeper. The top teams have two keepers close in ability; City have Hart and Caballero, Chelsea have Courtois and Cech, Arsenal have Sczesny and Ospina. Competition makes almost every player perform better and Brad isn't the standard to be a threat to the type of keeper we want as number one choice. We could keep him as a third choice keeper but I would prefer to give that spot to a young keeper from the academy.

2. *Glen Johnson*: Glen's contract is nearing its end and he seems unwilling to extend on a lower wage. Hes been a great servant to the club regardless of his performances over the past year but he simply isn't worth his wages. We're currently paying him the type of wage you would pay one of the best right backs in the world, which at the time we gave him the contract I would argue he was worth it, yet its impossible to argue we should continue to pay him a wage higher than what Azpilicueta, Baines, Alaba, Debuchy, Rafael etc are earning.

3. *Martin Skrtel*: It seems mad to suggest a current bona-fide starter should be sold, but in my opinion Skrtel just isn't good enough to start anymore. The game against Arsenal was the perfect example of why we can't continue to start Skrtel if we want our defence to improve, he gets outjumped by Debuchy and costs us the win by completely halting our momentum going into half-time. His offensive threat going forward simply doesn't excuse his defending which just isn't improving. He is experienced and should be an organiser of the defence but lacks leadership and his tactical awareness and positional play is apalling for someone who has been a Premier League defender for years. Also, we have invested heavily into Dejan Lovren and for all his faults he has to be given time with the team, and so far it seems playing the two of them together is a nightmare as they seem to amplify each other's weaknesses causing massive instabilities at the back. There could be an argument in spite of this that he should be a third choice centre back, yet we're not paying him 90K a week to sit on the bench and honestly I doubt we can afford to keep players on the bench with high wages on the wage bill. Another reason I believe we should sell Skrtel next Summer is that he will get older and eventually his physicality will decrease, whilst that is currently his greatest asset and keeps his potential transfer value high.

4. *Jose Enrique*: Enrique is a decent defender and okay backup but I think he's too injury prone to be a consistent player for us and by constantly being injured he offers almost zero competition to Moreno. I don't think Moreno is good enough currently to warrant starting almost every game by virtue of having no valid competition for his starting place.

5. *Sebastian Coates*: Coates could be a decent defender in Italy, Spain or even somewhere in South America but he doesn't have the pace to play in the Premier League or in a high defensive line that Liverpool employ. ~~The fact that he hasn't been starting for Sunderland clearly shows he isn't good enough to play for Liverpool~~ as he isn't suited to the league.

6. *Steven Gerrard*: Obviously this will be the most controversial choice, just hear me out. Steven Gerrard is the second best Liverpool player I've ever personally watched play, and has been incredible for us for years. But it may be best for his own future and  the club's future for him to leave. In a deep position, Lucas is currently a better option, in a attacking position we have ridiculous potential in our current players and I would prefer them to start. Gerrard will not want to sit on the bench, and its horrible to say but he won't win a League Title with us. Gerrard could sign for someone abroad and be a key player for years but currently in the Premier League is a liability for us. His Set-pieces seem to have detoriated recently aswell. He could escape the media pressure and abuse he gets from other teams fans also by leaving. We want to remember Gerrard as the inspirational Captain who singlehandedly won us tons of games, not as the aging player currently struggling to keep up with the pace of the league.

7. *Oussama Assaidi*: Pretty obvious, we should try and recoup some money rather than loaning him out again.

8. *Luis Alberto*: I like Alberto but he isn't suited to the Prem, I've honestly no idea why he was bought in the first place.

9. *Iago Aspas*: Regardless of his ridiculous hat-trick the other week he just isn't up to the standard we need from our strikers and we should attempt to recoup some of what we paid for him, hopefullly there will be a few buyers in Spain willing to take him off our hands.

10. *Rickie Lambert*: I know Rickie was only bought as backup but I think we should try and sell him after this season. He doesn't suit our style of play and will decline in ability over the next few months. Sterling has shown he can play the striker role if necessary and we have a few good young strikers who could be used instead. A young pacey striker would suit our style of play far better and his lack of mobility is completely at odds with the way we want to play.

11. *Fabio Borini*: I like Fabio, I think hes talented and committed but if we receive a reasonable transfer fee we need to sell him. I think with Origi and even Ibe returning from loan he won't get the minutes he wants, and its clear that Rodgers does not see him in any future plans.

12. *The Transfer Committee*: I think, along with most other fans we have been far too wasteful with our transfer budget these past few seasons, and the mysterious transfer committee seems to be getting the blame. Regardless of whether their buys have been successful or not, whether Rodgers truly has a say who we sell or buy we can all agree that it doesn't seem to be working.

13. *Colin Pascoe*: I have absolutely no idea whether Pascoe is a good Assistant or not but I think with Rodgers being so inexperienced as a manager he may need an assistant who has won trophies, managed in the Champions League and handled the pressure of being involved with consistent success. I don't think Pascoe really has the credentials which would counter Rodgers inexperience and naivety. Having an excellent assistant manager is almost as important as having an excellent manager.

14. *Brendan Rodgers?*: Like everyone I want Brendan to be successful, but I'm unsure whether he is truly up to the task of making us a consistent top side. Its his third season in charge and we're calling it a transitional period, we've wasted money and we have gaping holes in our team which I'm unsure whether he can fix them or not. He's made far too many mistakes this season and the Champions League performances under him were absolutely pathetic. I think there may be better options rather than him but it would be a gamble and perhaps unfair to sack him at the end of the season if we continue this horrific form throughout the season.

**In:**

1. *A New Goalkeeper*: We need a new keeper desperately. Jones isn't good enough to be a realistic alternative to Mignolet, and Mignolet desperately needs to have some competition for his spot so he himself can improve. I think there are a few options who we could buy to replace Mignolet. *Petr Cech* would be the priority, and we should hope for a miracle that Mourinho would consider selling him to us, or that he would even want to join us. However I believe it to be unrealistic. *Sergio Romero* does not get played enough at Monaco and I believe he is of similar ability to Mignolet, except he is much more confident with his feet and at commanding his box. He was part of the Argentina side that made it to the World Cup final and I believe you cannot make it to the final without a good keeper. *Asmir Begovic* would be another option, as he is an excellent keeper, commands his box and has practice of defending set-pieces from training with Stoke for years, however his price tag would be a worry.

2. *A Defensive Midfielder*: We should have bought a defensive midfielder in the Summer and we desperately need one. Lucas is good backup but his fitness is a worry and he will struggle to play in multiple competitions now with injuries constantly appearing. *Grzegorz Krychowiak* would be the first player I would pursue if I was Liverpool manager. He is great for the Polish national team and has been outstanding for Sevilla so far this season. He has incredible tackling, positional sense and can pass a ball well. He would add the much needed physicality to our midfield and is still young enough to improve. Other options we could try and buy would be an optimistic punt at *William Carvalho* but I expect him to sign for a bigger team. *Nigel De Jong* could be pursued as he is consistent, reliable and severly underrated. He scares other teams midfield and we need someone angrier than Henderson or Allen in certain scenarios. He is an excellent anchor and really should be playing in the Champions League but we could try and convince him a return to the Prem would be in his best interests.

3. *A Gerrard Replacement*: Assuming Gerrard will be let go for the reasons I stated above, he would need to be replaced. My choice would be *Yohan Cabaye*. He is great at set-pieces, controls the midfield and is not seeing enough game time at PSG. He also provides a threat from long distance shots which Gerrard hasn't had in quite a while. I think any other reasonable Gerrard replacements wouldn't have anywhere near the quality that Cabaye has.

4. *Our Loaned out players*: Andre Wisdom, Tiago Ilori, Jordan Ibe and Divock Origi could have been useful players for us this season. Them coming back will boost the squad depth immensly. 

5. *A Director of Football*: I think the club following a Director of Football structure would be beneficial yet Rodgers seems unwilling to work with one, which could create a serious problem and leads me on to my next point.

6. *A New Manager?*: If Rodgers continues to underperform this season then I think he will be replaced. Realistic options if he were to be fired would still be a gamble and the club may risk going backwards. I believe if he were to be sacked then the club should try and pursue Rafa Benitez or Frank de Boer. Klopp and Simeone are not realistic options. I rank both Rafa and Frank as better managers than Rodgers and would think they would lead the club in a better direction, yet replacing a manager is always a gamble.

**How would this leave the team going into the 2015/2016 season?**:

If all these changes were to happen, and if the team continues to play as poorly as they have; the team presumably managed by Rafa or Frank, as a set of 25 players would look something like this- http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=5hy6f

I believe we would have strength in depth in most positions, and including some of the excellent youth prospects such as Jordan Rossiter, Ojo, Sinclair, and others we would have a strong, versatile team.

Edinburgh is a difficult place to move to and the subreddit keeps getting questions on the topic. I am going to write a strategy and information here and we can hopefully update it with other comments, we may even make it into a sticky, if we do a good job!

**- Essentials -**

**How to search properties**  
There are websites to use, if you do this, you will have access to 99% of the available properties:  
1. www.zoopla.co.uk, www.citylets.co.uk, www.lettingweb.com, www.rightmove.co.uk, www.espc.com  - mainly contain properties from professional letting agents, who act on behalf of a landlord (this is the British word for ""property owner""). Some of these sites allow you to see the properties on a map, and this is a very handy feature. No self-respecting agent has properties available who are not posted online at all. Physically visiting an agent's shop is pretty much pointless.   
2. [www.gumtree.com](http://www.gumtree.com/flats-and-houses-for-rent/edinburgh) - mainly contains property from private landlords and some rooms to let (more about these later)  
3. www.spareroom.co.uk - mainly rooms to let   

**Where to live**  
Edinburgh is generally very safe and you will be fine most of the time. There are a few areas to be avoided and they are nicely coloured on various maps:  
1. [This one](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/wp/ourresearch/polar/mapofyoungparticipationareas/) shows young people's participation to higher education. It shows potential/aspirations of an area rather than current conditions and it is easy to use.  
2. [This one](http://www.sns.gov.uk/Simd/Simd.aspx) shows you specific problems of every area, it is complex to use but more detailed  
3. [One more map](http://casa.oobrien.com/booth/?zoom=12&amp;lat=55.94&amp;lon=-3.21&amp;layers=B000FFTT) for the shake of the argument.  
Opinions vary about which areas are ""ok"" and, of course, perception of an area results in big variations on rent prices. A good example is Leith sea-side, great prices, lots of vibe but some people would avoid living there. In the end, what matters is how accustomed you are and how well you can take care of yourself. If you are coming from a big city, then most of Edinburgh is safe and you can go for a yellow area in the first map. If you are not accustomed to potential city dangers, then you should play it safe and go for a purple area in the first map.  

You should also consider transportation costs. If you need to use the bus services daily, you will need a bus pass (costs £40 month for student, £51 for everyone else). IF you take into account commuting time, a cheaper flat may just not worth it in the end. If your university or work place is in the outskirts of Edinburgh, you should still target to live in the city centre, because this is where the fun is and otherwise you will end up isolated and not making the most of your time here (Herriot-Watt students are subject to this problem). Just make sure you're living near a bus that takes you to your daily destination instead of living outside Edinburgh.

Another thing to consider is local amenities. For example, it is better to live near a large super market and it will probably save you money in the long run (buy your food every day rather than takeaway). There are many small super markets but usually the range of products on offer is boring and suited for people who don't have time to cook.

**How to move around**  
Edinburgh has great bus coverage and a recently opened, yet quite useless, tram line. There is no underground. Wherever you are, you're not far away from a bus stop and there would be a bus coming very frequently. Many bus services run every 10 or 20 minutes, it is only a few that run every 30'. You can use Google Maps to see the bus stops near buy and be able to ask it to give you directions on your typical destinations (e.g. your campus) using public transport. However, using the buses daily can be pricey, so many people prefer to rent near their regular daily destination and just walk there. There are some  very helpful apps:  
1. Google maps - tells you where you need to go and which buses will take you there  
2. Bus Trackers (for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/edinbus-lothian-buses-times/id324503614?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.rivernile.edinburghbustracker.android&amp;feature=search_result)) - tell you when the bus is due to arrive at a specific bus stop. One more for Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.redbus).  
3. People use many more local apps, e.g. for mobile tickets etc, you will find these later  

Using a car is not popular and not recommended. The traffic is not that much but parking is horrible. Also, owning a car in the UK will cost A LOT in insurance (we're talking £1000/year just for that) and the car's value depreciates very fast. Generally a very bad option for newcomers, unless if your workplace is in the middle of nowhere. You also have to drive on the left. 

Cycling is a reasonably good option for the adventurous. You will get the occasional asshole driver but most drivers are good and calm. There is reasonably good cycle lane network.

**- Procedure to find a flat -**  

**Long before you arrive (I will call this day ""T"")**  
You need to book a hotel or somewhere to stay when you arrive and for a period of at least one, preferably two weeks. This is the time required for finding a property and signing the contracts. You will probably not need the full two weeks but better safe than sorry. You should do this as long in advance as possible, to get cheaper prices. If you are a student, you may be able to find a place at university accommodation at off-term periods (e.g. early September).

**T minus 15 days**  
15 days before you move to Edinburgh, have a very good look at the property websites mentioned above and understand what is going on. Get familiar with the areas, the prices how they relate with the kinds of properties etc. This is your initial approach, do not arrange anything yet.

**T minus 7 days**  
For the whole week before you arrive, check the websites for properties that have been **just added** in the website. Anything older will be gone by the time you are here, or it is total rubbish. Avoid flats that don't have many pictures, there must be a reason for that. Call the agents of the properties you like and arrange a viewing for the day after you arrive (T+1) or as soon as possible thereafter. Time the viewings wisely to do as many as you can on this day, use Google Maps to get travel time information by bus or walk and add about 30' buffer in case you get lost or miss the bus. If you are concerned about using Google Maps on roaming, you can either print your plans for the day and maps or just walk into a news agent and buy a pre-paid SIM card for your phone (don't forget to plan time for this, maybe you should do it on the day you arrive anyway - GifGaff is good). Do **not** think that you can hire a car at the airport and use it for your flat hunting, it is going to be very expensive and parking is extremely difficult to find (and expensive). If you think you can't use the bus, then it would be better to use taxis than hiring a car.  

**Day T+1**  
So, you landed at day T, you had a good sleep, wake up and hit the viewings. If you see a flat you like, ask what is the agent's process for securing it, it usually requires an application to be submitted with identity documents etc. Remember: fees are illegal. Some agents ask you to pay a ""holding fee"" which is later deduced from your deposit, this is fine as long as it is **immediately** refundable if THEY decide not to give you the flat - ask the details and what is their method of refunding it, bank checks would be no good since you don't have a bank account to cash them in. If you decide to apply, you should do this on the same day or first thing the day after. DO NOT DELAY as somebody else may view it in the meanwhile and apply first, in which case you may lose your priority. You should be looking to find SOMEWHERE reasonable, not THE BEST place, you can look for a better place in 6 months (see contracts).

**Further to T+1**
If you did not find anything on day T+1 then you can begin to worry and relax at the same time. Worry because you're quickly running out of time, relax because there is nothing you can do but repeat the searches online and find more properties, arrange viewings ASAP etc. It would also help to become slightly less picky about what you are looking for at this stage, remember, you can move our in just 6 months.

**If you can't find something within 7 working days**
Book another 5 working days in the hotel you're are staying or elsewhere, it is nearly impossible to secure a let in less than 5 working days so you will probably need the extra days.

**Letting a room only**  
You may have noticed a lot of hurdles in renting a property when you are a first mover. This is why many people chose to just rent a room and live with strangers, and there is nothing wrong with that. There are literally a million rooms available and they can be found on gumtree. The process involves a viewing and also some small talk to see whether you fit with the other tenants. Usually people try to match like with like, undergraduate students, postgraduate students, young professionals, females, males, tobacco smokers, weed smokers, non-smokers, gays, etc are all groups of people who may be looking for similar flatmates. A landlord, of course, exists but most likely they don't live in the property. He or she will, however, require deposits, guarantors etc, same as a typical agent, but it is the tenants who choose you (because they can, if it's not you, it will be the next guy coming up in half an hour).

**private landlords and smaller agents**  
Private landlords occupy a big market as well. They are usually found in gumtree and they vary from total sloppy and illegal to quite professional. The hint to distinguish them is whether they ask for any fees (therefore are happy to break the law) and also their overall professionalism. Every landlord, including private ones, must have a landlord registration number and you can check a flat's address against this number on [this website](https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/Pages/Process.aspx?Command=ShowHomePage), to see if they have the right to rent this flat. There are many scammers. DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY UNLESS IF YOU HAVE CHECKED THE LANDLORD REGISTRATION NUMBER AND HAVE SIGNED A CONTRACT.

**Student halls**  
Universities provide accommodation in student halls. This is a very good option if you are an 18-year-old fresher but it becomes less and less good as you grow older.

**Furnished/Unfurnished properties**  
Furnished properties outnumber unfurnished properties 10-1. Unfurnished usually includes a cooker, fridge and washing machine. Dishwashers are rare in all properties - you're lucky if you get one.

I was just wondering how much notice I should give to my current employer as I'm returning to my old job. I've only been here since the beginning of the month and my contract states I can resign without a notice period. However I'm contracted 25 hours a week, for a total of 100 hours a month. This is whether I work that long or not (For example if I'm scheduled 15 hours, I'd still be paid for 25 hours but I'd have to work the other 10 hours off in overtime)

Typically we'd get paid at the end of the month however due to the festive period I was paid yesterday - for the full 100 hours. I'm planning on handing in my notice on December 27th, but I was wondering whether I have any legal obligation to continue to work until I've reached the 100 hours they've paid me for.

It's no secret that Rodgers likes Mignolet and wants him as our first keeper. But what we need is someone who can come in and coach him. I think he's realised the mistake of letting Reina go.
So my theory is that he's dropped Migs to show the world, the likes of Cech or Ochoa, that the keeper role is not predecided.

I am running a short survey on both r/unitedkingdom and r/ukpolitics on peoples perception of Parliament. It is a short University study into how people view parliament. I would appreciate it if you could take a short 10 mins of your time to answer the following the survies. 

The survey is broken up into two documents each document has one question only. In between the two documents I would like you to look at the parliament website and spend about 5 minuets browsing through. Then I would like you to answer the second Survey.  

The steps are as followed. 

1st - Answer - [Survey A](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fDUDug-cv_4IUGsi5GmUyY4H1ZNVIiELSZbRU124IdY/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1)

2nd - Look at the [Parliament website](http://www.parliament.uk/) for about 5 mins. 

3rd - With the website in mind answer [Survey- B](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O7C3l45Ean5wkJA17vxF81xPr1QmSO1--tj9yp-dw_M/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1)

What are peoples thoughts on these teams? I have heard a rumour that the Mens team won't be holding any training sessions, instead they will be partaking in several tournaments on the run up to Under23's in July. Interesting plan though somewhat contradicting the rhetoric from the senior GB open team leadership that more trainings = more success. 

How will these teams fare at tour in Spring / Summer? What are their realistic chances of doing well in London?

To do this I suggest rotating between the formation we lined up against Arsenal: 
http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=5v0w (with the addition of Lucas and a few others I missed out (because that isn't the aim of this post)

EDIT: Dont even take note of this tactic just the one below, just here in case people had no idea at all how we played. (and it would probably be Lucas and Gerrard/Allen/Hendo instead)

But I feel like we should throw this into the mix to keep it fresh.
http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=5v0g

We can freely swap between both of these if we brought up Can who could back off into the 3 at the back as the formations are essentially the same but the first 6 players are inverted and pushed further up as wingers. I feel like Gerrard needs to be rotated higher up the field in Coutinho's position as I don't see him as a holding and we need more creativity higher up the field to get the ball to the strikers.
Thoughts?

We moved house. We had an order to get a phone line and broadband put in. We had a specific date that we were told an engineer would come in, which they cancelled without telling us, they rearranged the appointment for later on during the week.  

The engineer comes in a week late, says the house wiring is knackered and drills a hole in the wall to run a new line. Phone line works, we get told they cant activate our internet account. 

Cue three weeks of constant calls, missed appointments and wasted money. We got ONE engineer in for £130 who came, told us the house wiring is knackered, left.

We got put through to a manager who promised to get our account activated by midnight tomorrow and that someone would call us between 8am-1pm. No one called, we called them, got put through to India and were told that they wont even look at it until the 31st, even though we were given a guarantee that it would be done tomorrow and that we had been put forward as a ""priority fast lane"" case.  

My mum mostly works from home so she cant work. I dropped money on a gaming PC which I cant really use now and I havent been able to contact any of my friends for a long time now. We are all getting really stressed, my mum has been in absolute tears over the constant lying and back and forth and wasted money. 

Is there ANYTHING we can do at this point? I can get very limited access to Reddit through my shitty data plan and thats about it.


Edit: We finally got through to a UK based call centre, the man on the phone was amazing really helpful, told us that the call centre in India had acted inappropriately (turns out they have left their fuck ups out of the customer notes) and informed us that we have enough evidence to claim compensation.

The activation team is scheduled to call us tomorrow, if they don't then we are cancelling our service and will look at the providers that you guys have been kind enough to link to.

I looked on the internet which would be my A-Level equivalent and it looks like a BBB (7'5 mark average in my two years of Bachillerato). Seeing as I got a 6'9 last year and I'm currently aiming at 8 - 8'5, I don't think I would make it to ABB (8), which is very low to begin with and required by Nottingham University.

I wanted to come to the UK to study with a better education than here in Spain, but all the middle-high tier universities I'm finding require marks I can't achieve.

I would appreciate recommendations on what to do now or what university could I apply to.

I'm really keen on Edinburgh and Manchester (though this might change if I do end up getting an offer from SOAS, it'd be nice to live in London as the city has literally become my third home). I have friends studying in Edinburgh and they love it there. I'd like to know more about the environment/atmosphere/nightlife/etc at the unis I just listed above so I could make a proper judgement of all the unis before arriving to a final decision. 

Don't laugh at me but one of the attractive features of studying in Manchester would be being able to watch Man Utd's home games at Old Trafford (sorry City supporters who are reading this thread haha). I've been to Manchester before and I really liked it. It's not quite far from London so I can visit my mates studying there + my genius besties at Cambridge (if they get in). Cold climate and grey skies with virtually no sun for long periods of time are not a problem for me since I've lived in Russia before. (I consider temperature below -15'C as proper freezing cold)

I will be studying Japanese Studies/Linguistics so multilingual/multicultural hotspots are what I'm looking for (I'd like to brush up my languages). I'm also a photography hobbyist, football fanatic (thus Manchester looking like a realllly good option), musician annnd academic buff (I'd like to be a university lecturer one day). I don't drink (I expect myself to be the one who brings my future drunk mates home hah) so not really interested in pubs. Night clubs on the other hand are another thing. 

**Questions**:

*  What are the living accomodations like? Average rent fee per week/month?

*  Sports facilities? Are there any good dance studios offering dance lessons? What about archery/badminton?

*  Political views? (Living in Egypt has made me wary of political fanatics...)

*  How's the nightlife/entertainment scene? 

*  What sights would you recommend for photo shoots?

*  Any chance of me getting small gigs as a translator or a photographer at one of the local businesses? I want to start earning some side money so I wouldn't have to rely entirely on my parents for financial needs + build up my CV for post-graduation work.

*  Academic facilities/resources? I plan on studying other subjects on my own for fun if I don't get killed by the amount of workload the professors will dish out on us. (I'm also interested in mathematics, history and sciences)

*  Football - okay, what are the chances of me being able to watch a Premier League (Scottish League in the case of Edinburgh) match played at one of the nearby local stadiums? (Doesn't matter what club, I'm all for neutral games)

*  Photography dark rooms? What are the photography student unions like?

Apologies for the lengthy post &amp; set of questions but I'd like to know what to expect so I won't end up as the typical lost international student when I move to the UK. Cheers for taking your time to read this!

Interesting little insight into how his game has evolved yet the same Eriksen is still there in terms of creating chances. Stats do need to be taken lightly but it does help highlight how he has changed.

- Eriksen has nearly matched last seasons goal tally in 8 fewer appearances (6 in 17 vs 7 in 25)

- Eriksen has already surpassed last seasons shot count (49 vs 48) in 8 fewer appearances

- Despite Eriksen creating 40 chances so far this season only 1 has been converted, providing just 1 assist to his name (vs last seasons 8)

- Eriksen is on track to match or surpass the amount of chances created last season, indicating a lack of end product from the forward line and not in his ability

- Eriksen has matched last seasons amount of successful take-ons (25 vs 25) in 8 fewer appearances with his success rate climbing to a 67% average vs last seasons 46%

- The majority of Eriksens goals this season have shifted from his left foot to his right

- Goals scored with left foot (13/14 vs 14/15): 4 | 1

- Goals scored with right foot (13/14 vs 14/15): 2 | 5

Stewart Lee was in attendance, didn't win an award and wrote a mopey article in the guardian where he tried to claw back some respect by pretending the whole thing was ironic. I almost choked on my tea laughing when Lee Mack beat him for Best TV Comic. I mean, what did he expect?

Harry Enfield was doing a bit the whole way through that got off to a shaky start when presenter Jonathan Ross instantly cock-blocked him.

Matt Berry seemed in no mood for Rossy's shenanigans when he took the stage to present an award and though he didn't win the breakthrough award, which instead went to pseudo-drunk beardy winner Nick Helm, his show Toast of London did win best new comedy show.

Brendan O’Carroll (Mrs Brown's Boys) won the writer's guild award, presented with bizzare sentimentality by Ian Beale.

There was no Rik Mayall tribute, besides his name being included in the credits alongside other recently dead people.

The after-show, British Comedy Awards: Even More Awards, was even more interesting than the main event, presented by token woman Katherine Ryan and token handicapped guy Alex Brooker. A very drunk Adam Hills seemed more than a little fed up with being used as a vehicle for political correctness, while seeming to have no problem with perpetuating Australian stereotypes.

I don't know how Katherine Ryan got the job, but her presence was a terrifying image of the future of television as she made her interviewees uncomfortable and presumably used the gig to fine-tune her image as a bastion of political correctness, making a very random reference to white male privilege and at one point accusing speccy Inbetweener, Simon Bird, of ""correcting women"" when he corrected her.

And whilst fairly maligned by certain sections of supporters for the last year or so, I fucking hope we keep him, despite the fact he holds the highest market value amongst our midfield. I think we have reason to be optimistic.

In the last few weeks we've seen a change in Mousa. I think we can rightly hope that Poch and his team will be able to get the most out of him. The way we manage the fitness of our players seems very promising, and perhaps for the first time, we're creating a team ethic and genuinely *teaching* our players how to play the game. How to move and play as a dynamic team.

So the hope is that Mousa can put his injury worries behind him so as to step it up physically. And also, that he can develop a sense of surety and purpose on the pitch that will have him utilize his vast potential. He can also be used in a variety of positions.  When Mason went off injured, we lost a lot from an attacking standpoint. I think Dembele can bring that, he just needs to be coached so as to understand his role and learn the tempo we want to play at.

He got a lot of flak for it, and the performances weren't encouraging. We lost link up play, our midfield sat too deep, and we weren't able to press as well. We needed runners alongside Gerrard and Lucas couldn't provide that. Amongst other reasons, I would be happy to hear why you guys thought this combo didn't work before. We even played those two in a midfield trio with Hendo or Allen, to no good effect. Rodgers had to drop Lucas in order to accommodate Gerrard in the deeper role. 

Yet now we see these last few games Rodgers has figured out how to make Lucas and Gerrard work together. And I haven't been able to fully figure out why, though I have my hypotheses. First, it seems Gerrard is no longer the deepest midfielder, which changes the dynamic of playing these two together--Lucas can sit back and cover while Gerrard can move the ball forward himself and get forward more. 

Second, I think the presence of wingbacks has provided us an excellent outlet in possession. If you watch the last two games you'll find our wingbacks were the free man many times to circulate the ball and move it up the pitch. This means we don't suffer from a disconnect between our defensive and offensive half of the team. Plus having Lallana and Coutinho dropping deep to collect the ball in pockets of space also helps. Unlike at the beginning of the year, I think they are able to find more space because the wingbacks stretch the opposition backline. And I also think playing Sterling up front has helped. With a speedy player looking to make runs in behind, the opposition has to either sit deeper or worry about Gerrard (and others) playing balls over the top. Notice the Arsenal backline seemed to sit deeper against us (and when they didn't Sterling provided them difficulty). Teams sitting a bit deeper provides more room for our midfield to operate in. Either the whole opposition team sits deeper in which case they have to deal with the width of the wingbacks, or their midfield still presses up, a bit like Arsenal yesterday, and they leave pockets of space for our attacking midfield. 

But I still don't see exactly why a pairing of Lucas and Gerrard that seemed so abysmal earlier seems to not have issues anymore. Would love to hear your thoughts.

###Umami chicken drumsticks

Serves four really hungry buggers.

For this to work well you will need a really good big, shallow cast iron casserole dish with a lid. It needs to be shallow because you want the vegetables to braise in the cooking sauce, but the chicken pieces to have nicely browned tops.

We're going to boil the rice as plainly as possible because it will get slathered in the cooking sauce when we serve it all up.

**Ingredients :-**

* 1.5kg chicken drumsticks, ideally the cheap-as-chips reduced-to-clear sort I just used
* 400g new or mid potatoes, the sort that would roast nicely
* 4 or 5 shallots or other small onions, whole. Used chopped onion if you prefer
* 1 large carrot, peeled and sliced
* 1 large romano pepper, sliced into 3cm batons
* 1 stick of celery, sliced
* a few cloves of garlic, minced
* a couple of slices of lemon, quartered
* a generous tbsp. of sumac
* a pinch of oregano
* a large spoonful of capers
* a little chicken stock, maybe 100ml or so
* a dollop of good Dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp. cornflour
* 2 tbsp. paprika
* unsalted butter
* EV olive oil
* Basmati rice
* Oven bread, e.g. ciabatta

**Method :-**

1. Preheat your oven to gas mark 6
2. Add an equal (and generous) amount of butter and olive oil to a frying pan and fry off the drumsticks until just beginning to brown
3. Meanwhile, add a little oil and butter to the casserole. Allow to warm over a low heat and once it begins to sizzle add the sumac, paprika, oregano, and some freshly ground salt and pepper, and allow the mixture to absorb the fat and begin to infuse its flavours, for up to a minute
4. Before it burns, add the minced garlic and lemon pieces, just for a few moments
5. Lob in the onions, celery, and carrots and leave to warm for a few seconds
6. Once that lot is beginning to sizzle, add a little chicken stock to stop it burning and congealing, stir, and then add the potatoes and peppers
7. Now remove all the chicken from the frying pan with a slotted spoon and add to the casserole, which should still be on a low heat. Mix it all up so everything is nicely coated
8. Mix a little cornflour with some cold water and add to the remaining oil in the frying pan
9. Add a dollop of Dijon mustard and the capers, beat with a balloon whisk, and add a little more chicken stock to get a really nice moderately thick sauce
10. Once the sauce is looking good pour it over the chicken pieces and the vegetables in the casserole, *put the lid on* and whack it in the oven for maybe 45 mins
12. Turn the oven up a little, remove the casserole and move things around a bit, and replace in the oven *without the lid*. This is the part where we let the drumsticks brown and become crispy, about 25 mins
11. Meanwhile, rinse, rinse, and thrice rinse your Basmati rice in cold water, whilst bringing a large pan of salted water to a rolling boil
12. Put the rinsed rice in the pan, and at the same time stick the bread in the oven
13. Give everyone a big pile of rice, and serve chicken pieces and vegetables next to it, and be sure to spill lots of the sauce all over the shop, especially on the rice. Put the hot bread on the table and let those hungry fuckers at it with their bare hands
14. Profit/blow job/brownie points

I cannot tell you just how fucking wonderful this turned out. We're all loafing around the house groaning with our tummies hanging out. It broke my savoury meter. Total cost? About £5 because I used so much reduced stuff from the Co-op in the village. Fucking rah.

Sadly, unlike my tubby red-wearing counterpart, I don't have the benefit of having elf slaves to do my work for me as I make the league table and check it twice, which is why I missed the original deadline of yesterday, but one day out isn't bad at all! It's quite fitting, if anything, considering the sheer volume of incorrect scores over the past few games. I counted 66 'incorrect' results between the first prediction table and this one (I really got sick of noting them down, a little variety would have been nice!), which I think says a lot about Leeds' patchy form and our own optimism as fans.

The Derby result definitely stands out as a highlight, shaking up the table as a lot of people were rewarded for their optimism with a point - sometimes even three - and hopefully Leeds will be able to do that more often in the coming year. That's definitely on my Christmas wishlist! The next league table will be published around this time in January, so until then, have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year everyone, and I hope you enjoy the table!

How this all works:

In order to judge this, I've shamelessly stolen the formula used by the score predictor competition in /r/championship:

3 Points for correctly guessing the score. - Say 3-1 score is 3-1.  
1 Point for correctly guessing the winner. - Say 3-1 score is 2-0.  
0 Points for incorrect winner. - Say 3-1 score is 0-2.  
-2 Points for reverse score. - Say 3-1 score is 1-3.

I have also used number of games played to separate players on equal points, as a reward for those who have been more active in these threads.",false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,null,null,self,Who is /r/LeedsUnited's best predictor?

**- More information -**

**Which floor?**  
Basement flats exist in Edinburgh, you can survive in one for six months, especially if you are on a budget. (security precautions of groud-floor flats apply). If you're in a good area, basement flats are fine, just watch out for damp. You might want to invest in a dehumidifier if you're staying for a while.  

If you get a ground floor flat (this is at the street level), make sure it is double-glazed. This deters opportunistic burglars who are after your laptop. Also, keep your curtains closed (make sure the flat has curtains) and be prepared to endure some noise if in a busy area.

First and second floor flats are the best, not too many flights of stairs to climb.

You will regret any third floorer higher flat every time you come back to it. Lifts are very rare in Edinburgh.

**Students and professionals**  
Many flats are designated for students or professionals. A professional may rent a student flat but not the opposite. Flats for professionals are usually more expensive but better. Be ware that if a professional lets a flat with other students, he/she will have to pay council tax but students flatmates won't agree to share that bill.

**How agents select tenants**  
Most properties receive multiple applications and the agent assess your financial situation/status before they decide who is the least risky. You cannot easily influence that but if you are a professional with a good job offer you should be fine. (also, make a good impression at the viewing)

**Smoking**  
If you are a smoker do not say so and don't smoke right before the viewings, even if you don't plan to smoke in the flat. Most landlords don't like smokers and that may be in your contract as well. It is a big risk if you smoke in the flat, in case you cause a fire you will pay the damages yourself (which of course can be many thousands of pounds). 

**Pets**  
Pets are generally not allowed on rented accommodation. You may find some landlords who would let you bring a pet but they will almost certainly have you pay a higher deposit and/or other hurdles.

**Contracts**  
Contracts usually last for 6 months, sometimes more, and then enter a ""monthly"" or ""bi-monthly"" rolling period. That means you can exit the contract as long as you give one or two months notice. Some flats come with fixed length contracts, usually expiring in July. Exceptions are possible and you should always check your contract terms.  

**Evictions**  
If your landlord wants you to go, he must do so formally, via a court procedure called eviction. This applies even if your initial term of the contract has elapsed. They cannot just tell you to leave, no matter why. They also need to give you enough time to do so (i.e. to find somewhere else). Do not make your live difficult if you don't have to.  

**Troubleshooting**  
If your property has a small problem, you should complain to the agent/landlord until it is fixed. By complain we mean call them every day, visit their shop etc. Do **not** withhold the rent as a means of pushing them as this is illegal and gives them a method to evict you. If the property has a big problem (e.g. a broken window) then you have laws covering you and it should be fixed immediately. Most agents will have a 24-hour emergency lines for things like water leaks and/or if you lost your keys (they will charge you in this last case).  


**Deposits and guarantors**  
Almost all landlords will ask for a deposit. This is usually one month's worth of rent and it is refundable **after** you leave the flat and **after** the landlord/agent has checked that everything is in good condition. Some agents will let you be present when the final inspection happens and you may even get the option for a pre-inspection to make things right if you ask - do ask. Deposits cannot be more than 2 month's rent. 

If you are a student, you need a guarantor. The guarantor must be a UK resident for over 3 years and receive a salary or pension. If you do not have a guarantor, look for the few agents who allow a higher deposit or ask you to pay 6 months of rent up-front. You should be able to ask this when you call to arrange the viewings.

If you are a professional with a job offer, they will need to see that offer and/or they will call the employer for confirmation. If you are going to be on probation, your offer is not worth anything to them. You better ask the agent for advice (most likely you will need a guarantor, same as the students).

**Bills**  
Heating is a big part of your monthly bills, Edinburgh is cold and old flats are not well insulated. Most heat is released from cracks in the windows, hence double-glazed/modern windows are superior to the old wooden ones. Flats with gas heating (also called central heating or gas central heating or GCH) are cheaper to keep warm and so are flats with double glazing. The number of windows and their size also plays an important role. Electric heating is to be avoided, unless if you have no choice. 

Properties in scotland pay tax to the local government, known as Council Tax. Each property is classified in a band and the amounts for each band are available [here](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20005/council_tax/620/council_tax_bands_and_charges). This cost is usually not included in the property's rent (unless if the property is advertised as ""all bills inclusive"") yet it should be taken into account, as it can vary between two very similar properties. Students are exempt from this charge while if you live alone (or all your other flatmates are students) you can claim 25% discount. You will have to apply to the City Council before you're granted an exception or discount.

**Broadband &amp; Mobile**  
There are two types of broadband internet in Edinburgh:  
1. Via an ISP who is sub-letting the aDSL network - this is a relatively slow solution (10-18Mbps) but probably covers the whole town       
2. Via a company called [Virgin Media](http://www.virginmedia.com) who don't cover all the properties but offer cable connections that in theory can go faster than the aDSL ones (up to 150Mbps at time of writing)  
3. Via ""fibre to the cabinet"" broadband in some areas now. These will go around 70Mbps and are being sold by the same providers who sell aDSL. [Check availability.](http://www.superfast-openreach.co.uk/where-and-when/)  
4. If you are a light internet user and do not plan to stay long, you may be able to cover your needs with mobile broadband only (see below).  
You will get what you paid for with broadband. Your cost will vary from £20 - £60 per month, depending on the speed of the line and the quality of the ISP. What you should try NOT to do as a newcomer is tie yourself in a long (e.g. 18-month) contract that you cannot exit from. It is difficult but not impossible if you shop around.  

For mobile, you have a few more options but most of the companies and tariffs are very similar. Coverage **is** bad in some random places around Edinburgh so your best option is to start with a ""pay as you go"" SIM card and check the coverage in the area you will end up living and working at. Buying a SIM card should be one of the very first things to do, possibly right after you check-in to your hotel. It will save you a lot of money and allow agents to call you in a UK number. You can buy them in grocery stores and super markets, read their marketing/instructions to see what you will be paying and the data charges.

Most of the communication companies above will try to tie you in long-term contracts that you cannot exit from. You should try to avoid this, it may cost you more but you will regret it less. Test a provider before you commit to them.

**Insurance**
Insurance: You'll need your own insurance to cover your possessions in the flat, called 'contents insurance'. Expect to pay around £10 per month. The landlord will insure the building and their fixtures, fittings and furniture themselves. You do not have to buy insurance but peace of mind is a great thing.

**Other things to know**  
1. It is illegal for letting agents in Scotland to charge **any** money for **anything** other than rent or deposit in order to secure a property rental. Agents call these fees with many names like ""credit checks"" and they may give a number of excuses as to why they charge them (read: ""we use an external company""). An agent charging fees means they are happy to break the law and if they do so in this case then they may be happy to break the law in other cases - don't use them.  
2. It is nearly impossible to find a hotel or anywhere for a reasonable prince in August. Edinburgh has a number of festivals going on simultaneously in August and the city is full of festival goers and tourists, we're talking seriously full here, basically no hope. If you cannot change your arrival to a time other than August, make sure you book as much in advance as possible and hope for the best. September is busy as well, because students without somewhere to live arrive. However, it is less busy than August.  
3. It is general consensus that the property agent with name Grant Management or Grant Property is not a good agent but be careful because they advertise attractive rents.  
4. It is a landlord's market, you will feel hopeless at times.  
6. Flats are old and staircases dirty. You should consider the staircase as part of the street and not expect much.  
7. European Laws allow buyers of remote services to claim a refund. For this reason, professional agents **will not agree** to let you in a flat (nor take any money from you) unless if you have seen the flat - they are not crazy. If someone offers you to accept money while you have not seen the flat then consider it a scam and don't send money.  
8. Landlords **must** send your deposit to a ""Deposit Protection Scheme"", which is basically a company that keeps it safe. This company also manages any disputes between landlord and tenant when the tenant leaves.  
9. When you move-in to your new flat **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING WITH PICTURES**. And I mean **EVERYTHING**. Every wall, every window, every carpet, every room, every piece of furniture. It will take you one hour but it can save you loads of money should there is a dispute about the condition of the flat when you leave. Once you take the pictures, send a copy to your agent or landlord and have them agree that this is indeed the condition of the flat. Agents also have a way to document a property's condition by means of a property inventory but this is usually just a document without pictures. By the way, you should double-check that document as well and submit any comments within the period stated there, otherwise you would be assumed to accept it as it is.  
10. If your letting agency does demand fees, you can [reclaim them](http://www.reclaimyourfees.com/).  
11. The best source for general information about tenancy rights is [Shelter](http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice).  
12. Most letting agents will perform inspections during your tenancy, usually every 3 or 6 months but that varies. Landlords or agents are not allowed to enter the property you rent without your permission, unless in an emergency. You can just not let them in if you don't want.  
13. All contracts will say that subletting your flat is not allowed and that is true. However, nobody can stop you from inviting non-paying guests (like friends or family or even couch surfers) should you want to.  
14. One-bedroom flats are very difficult to find, even more in September. If you can afford it, consider a two-bedroom flat, it may be as little as just £50 more expensive.  
15. If you are overseas, don't expect letting agents to show any interest in you. They are inundated with emails and phone calls from overseas students and visitors and the rental market here moves fast. Once you are here and able to view properties, they will be more help.  
16. Bear in mind when dealing with agents that you are not the customer. ""I have money to spend and they are not interested"" is commonly heard in this sub, but the agent's customer is the owner of the property. The agent doesn't make any money from you (at least they don't if they are following the law).  
17. Every agent you speak to, tell them what you are looking for and ask them to call you if something becomes available. They may not, but it is worth asking. If you have a UK mobile number, you're more likely to get a call back. If not, give your number as it needs to be dialled in the UK. Don't leave it to the agent to work out what your country code is, because they won't bother.

Basically, I am looking for items of any spec that a beginner can tinker with, that won't be too costly if I mess up/completely FUBAR. Since these components will be used to practice and nothing more, I'd also be interested in paying shipping and collateral, to loan and return your items once I've gained some experience (if this is an option, I cannot assure your items' safety as I am completely new to building systems/installing hardware and I may make errors).

In summary, and old hardware/systems would be appreciated - just PM me if you have spares you want to get rid of and we can negotiate a price.

Our current team with 3 at the back seems to be working well but the players are probaly a little tired so maybe swapping out Markovic for Balotelli, maybe not from the start of the game but at halftime



What squad would you like to see? Personally i would love to see Balotelli in the squad as i feel he came so close at Utd to getting a goal and with our 3 in the back formation it might be his time to shine. All it takes is that 1 goal for a striker to get his convidence back and then he will prove to be a good signing for the club



The rest of the squad is probably gonna be the same more or less

What with the [signing of Emile Heskey](http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/emile-heskey-signs-for-bolton-wanderers-2162736.aspx) and now this!

This new stylesheet is so much better than that old one that we had. There are many reasons for this.


**Its Modern**

Look around on websites which are winning [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/awards-of-the-day/) nowadays, all of the websites are flat and has solid colours on the page. This is at the moment the big trend of the internet.


**Its runs off a spritesheet**

If you don't know what it is, its basically a big image of smaller images, we are now using on of these instead of using one for each is that the subreddit should load a lot faster now. It also makes it a lot more easier to eddit icons and images on the subreddit. 

**It is using CSS3 properly**

The last stylesheet was using CSS3, but it was using it stupidly. Now it is not abusing it anymore.


**(Partial) Reddit Enhancement Suite Support**

It doesn't have total RES support, but it is a start and there shall be more coming within the next few weeks, including night mode. But there are no confilcts with the stylesheet for non-RES users. If you dont know what [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) is, it is basically a way to improve the Reddit experience. I have had it for a while now and I cant live without it!


**Its built a lot more better**

There was a lot of issues with the last stylesheet as there were massive gaps between comments and the navigation was covering things up. But now it doesn't.


**A few other things**

So the new stylesheet has a few more things to it as it can now support things like table formatting and hopefully in the future we might have some custom flairs with images in them.

There are still a few things to iron out and tweak but it is sort of finished in terms of the design an look of it. As per usual we are welcome to any feedback of the new stylesheet, If you want to do this anonymously then please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbwfc).

Looks like I failed to hit 'save' on a few updates, sorry Yankeecookiemaster! I'm just working through the mountain of updates, will look into it shortly. *8:40, 26th Dec.*

Right, who wants to have a go at the [King Williams' Quiz 2014?](http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/dec/24/king-williams-college-quiz-2014)

Did you ever think you'd seen a few tough quizzes here at TRL? You're wrong, think again. Imagine something *much, much* harder. You're still wrong, it's harder than that.

The KWQ is set before Christmas every year at the King William School, Isle of Man, where traditionally the pupils would sit the quiz a bit like an exam paper and complete as little or as much as they could, before returning home for Christmas where they could research the questions to submit a second set of answers after the winter break. It is fiendishly cryptic and devilishly difficult.

So, TRL, who wants to muck in with me and see how much we can answer?

Here's the skinny - I'll run the thing, anyone who wants to volunteer an answer to any question, no matter how vague or half-arsed, can do so in the comments and I will edit the questions and answers below as they come in. 

Solutions may be arrived at incrementally, i.e. questions won't be closed once answered, they are always open for better answers, and players should freely submit clues, hints, hunches, and suggestions, no matter how hand-wavy.

I'll tag answers with user nicks (but not /u/usernames 'cos anyone with gold will get username mention-bombed) as we go. There are 180 questions, and many of you will be unable a single one at first reading!

This is a collaborative effort to demonstrate to a waiting world the amazing intellectual juggernaut that is a chaotic barroom full of argumentative pissheads. Yeah, that'll show 'em!

This is all based on the facebook photos that just came out. The players wearing green, I put down as the starting 11. Others were white or none.

Mignolet and Jones, there was no way for me to tell on the photos cause neither wore a bib.

Suso... just a question mark cause I would be very surprised if he plays, cause he hasnt played or started for a while.
Coutinho and Lallana didn't wear a bib at all, so it might be one of them, or both of them and Suso doesn't play at all.

This gameweek the highest position we can achieve is 9th and the lowest is 12th. 

Since there are so many teams and matches that I shall not list them until we have a very few competitors. 


Position | Percentage Chance
--------|-----------------
9|56.409%
10|22.277%
11|17.604%
12|3.711%

And in our quest for a top 4 position, its important to know how far we will  be from the 4th place. So here are the points difference from the 4th spot.

Points | Percentage Chance
--------|-----------------
6|21.559%

9|25.187%
10|10.985%
11|2.041%
12|1.315%

Feedback will be greatly appreciated :)

I'm now on Matt Smith's Doctor and I just had a question (and a comment).

1)  I just finished the Devil's Run episode, where the Doctor builds an army to rescue Amy and the baby.  Why didn't the Doctor go back and get Martha/Cpt.Jack/Mickey?  I get logistically why the show didn't (having to rehire actors) but why wouldn't the Doctor have gone back and gotten some of his companions with great military background?  

2)  Kind of related, why doesn't the Doctor ever visit his old companions?  When Tennant goes they basically make it seem like he is literally dying, this feels much different than when Eccleston went, especially because there was companion overlap between Eccleston and Tennant.  It just seems weird to me that the Doctor cared so much for his friends before he regens but then after he completely forgets they exist (yes I know he's a different person, but still).

Finally a comment.  In the episode with ""the flesh"", Amy insists that one of the Doctors, which turns out to be the flesh doctor is ""hers"".  In the episode she believes that she is talking about the original Doctor, (it turns out they switched shoes and she is talking about the flesh Doctor).  HOWEVER, she is actually flesh, therefore, she was RIGHT, the flesh Doctor is her Doctor!

*‘‘Marley was dead to begin with, there's no doubt about that’’*

— and thus Charles Dickens' slim little Christmas book gets under way and Scrooge's remarkable journey of reclamation begins. *A Christmas Carol* is a wonderful read, full of amazing parallels that hopefully makes us occasionally re-examine our own existence and how we behave towards to one another.

Just over a hundred and sixty years ago in 1853, Charles Dickens strode at haste across the stage of Birmingham's Town Hall to give the first ever public reading of A Christmas Carol; one of many he was to give that season to benefit the New Midland Institute. Being a great supporter of the working man, Dickens agreed to this reading on condition that seat prices were reduced in order to suit the pocket of the working classes of the town, many of whom were glimpsing their hero for the first time. Here the city's newspaper describes the setting. 

*And thus the day passed and nightfall came on, more bitter and freezing than ever; the bleak wind whistling through the streets most dolefully. It was just such a night that Mr Dickens came to read his Christmas Carol to a small family circle of some 2,000 people in our vast Town Hall. What a grand, fine looking party it was. The lights were so brilliant and the drawing room so gay, and the holly so tastefully wreathed that there could be no mistake about this being Christmas. Then the host himself arrived and took his place in his big armchair and told us that we may laugh and cry as much as we wanted, as he liked nothing better than a lot of sympathy.*

I think we can safely assume that by the beginning of the 1850's, Charles Dickens was most certainly England's first 'superstar.' His fame as a writer was thundering rapidly across Europe and the United States. And his ever changing appearance was becoming known to millions through paintings, engravings and photographs which would appear almost weekly in a variety of periodicals, though many would never have encountered him in the flesh. Certainly very few of the 2000 eager faces who rose to cheer him that evening in 1853. What they would have seen was a gentleman of average build sporting a Frank Zappa moustache (the beard was to arrive later) and a mop of dark tousled hair brushed fiercely almost tempestuously forward. He was expensively attired in full evening dress, with diamond studs glittering in his shirt, a bright red buttonhole, a purple waistcoat and a simple watch-chain. He looked quite spectacular. While the applause continued to build, Dickens glanced fleetingly at the huge assembly of people, took a quick sip of water, and then with theatrical elegance raised a hand for silence. As the applause faded so grew a sense of excitement as everyone leant forward in anticipation of hearing his voice for the very first time. ""Marley was dead: to begin with."" And so the evening began and continued to do so for three and a quarter hours. 

A Christmas Carol was written in 1843 and published in the same year that Henry Cole brought us the Christmas card; a time for rejoicing and initiating into our homes practices hitherto unheard of at the time, such as good cheer, sharing gifts, much merriment and even Christmas trees. Dickens's sources for the tale appear to be many and varied but are principally the humiliating experiences of his own childhood. But more than anything his distress at the conditions of the poor and the plight of children attending 'Ragged Schools'; organizations run voluntarily and dedicated to the free education of destitute children. It was visiting one such school and seeing the array of bright beaming faces that a seed was planted for a book, a book that he hoped would cheer people's hearts with generous fellowship. As soon as A Christmas Carol was published and the miserable images of Want and Ignorance, whom he describes as being, 'yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, were introduced, people immediately sat up and took notice. Changes were hurriedly made to the Poor Laws, the Factory Acts were repelled and with it came an end to child neglect and slavery. A Christmas Carol has achieved a kind of immortality, born out of the very conditions of the time. 

He poured into the story his own personal memories, especially that of Camden Town and the long walk that Bob Cratchit would have had to make to the City; of his sister Fanny's crippled four year old son, who took on the mantle of Tiny Tim. From his own deep self he drew the understanding that a grown man may pity the child he had been, and learn from that pity, as Scrooge does. 'In short I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the slightest license of a child and yet been man enough to know its value.' 

Dickens decided to set the tone of Carol through the eyes of one man. A mean, pinched, misanthropic old skinflint of a man, uncaring of others whose face 'wore the signs of care and avarice; a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, covetous old sinner; who carried such a low temperature about with him in the street that even the blind man's dog appeared to know him.' According to Dickens he stumbled upon the name while taking an evening walk through a graveyard in Edinburgh. Apparently the headstone was for the wine merchant Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose claim to fame was that he had won the first contract to supply whiskey to the Royal Navy. The inscription identified Scroggie as a 'meal mad (in other words a corn merchant), but, due to the fading light and Dickens mild dyslexia, he may have misread this as 'mean man.' But either way Ebenezer Scrooge, one of literature's most notorious characters, sprung immediately into life. Unfortunately the headstone was lost during reconstruction in 1932. 

It is generally believed that the character of Scrooge was largely based on Gabriel Grub who appeared in Dickens’ first novel, The Pickwick Papers. Gabriel Grub was a rather misanthropic gravedigger, an 'ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow, who eyed each merry face as it passed him by, with a deep scowl of malice and ill-humour.' To show his displeasure for the festive season and his keenness for money Gabriel begins to dig a grave on Christmas Eve only to be visited by a gaggle of goblins who drag him down to their goblin kingdom. There he is shown all sorts of misery, even the death of a small, much loved child and awakes a better man. 

Dickens began Carol in September 1843, and in keeping with the title of his work, divided the story into staves. (Using the word metaphorically, instead of chapters) Sometimes the emotion was too much and Dickens would have to break away and take long night walks, 'when, all sober folks had gone to bed,' covering anywhere between 15 or 20 miles. Six weeks later he completed it; and 'broke out' as he himself described, 'like a madman.’ ‘Such dining, such dancing, such conjuring, such blind-man's buffing such theatre going, never took place in these parts before.' Thackeray, not always an admirer of Dickens, called it a 'national benefit,' an American entrepreneur gave his employees an extra day’s holiday and Thomas Carlyle went straight out and bought himself a turkey. Stoking up all this cheerfulness was the news that the book had sold 6000 copies at five shillings each on its first day; becoming the most successful Christmas book of the season. (Mind you five shillings was nearly a half week's wage for some). Dickens knew instinctively that he had created a modern fairy story and for the first time been able to complete an entire fiction without being compelled to write in serial form. 

After the success at Birmingham, Dickens took his readings to every major town and city in the country, across to Ireland and eventually the United States of America, where he was greeted like some iconic movie star. But the strain took its toll on his health and he would insist on his doctor sitting in the wings in case of the possibility he might collapse. 

He began with A Christmas Carol and he ended with it. His last reading of the little book took place in London at the St James' Hall, March 15th 1870. At the end of the performance he told his audience that 'from these garish lights I vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and affectionate farewell.' There was a stunned silence immediately broken by a tumult of cheering, hat waving and the stamping of feet. With tears streaming down his face, Dickens raised his hands to his lips in an affectionate kiss and departed from the platform for ever; an infinitely sad and broken man. A few days later the Queen, at a private audience, regretted that she had not heard his reading. Dickens expressed his regret but explained he was unable to offer her a private performance, not on the grounds of infirmity, but because, as he told her, a mixed-class audience for him was essential. Etiquette kept him on his feet for the ninety minutes of their conversation, and as a mark of her esteemed respect the Queen did likewise. Charles Dickens was to die three months later at the age of 58. 

*Dickens wrote in the preface of A Christmas Carol:* 

**I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book to raise the Ghost of an Idea which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.**

*Their faithful Friend and Servant,*

*Charles Dickens*

I'm sorry you've clicked into this post because there is nothing happy here. 

5 years ago I organised everyone from the school year group to meet on christmas eve for drinks and catch-ups (we are 26/27 now so had been out of school for 5+ years).

It was a blast and everybody agreed for it to become a tradition of ours with me organising it.

Each year more people from the year group come and last year we were ram-packed into a pub to the point the landlord kicked us all out as the locals were complaining (fair enough). This year I decided a function room would be hired for convenience sake. Strictly invite only.

I handed my organising duties over this year as I have been pretty busy. I thought the guy I handed the organising over was an ok guy.. apparently not.

I have just gotten home from the function after not being allowed in as my name was not on the list. It turns out the guy I handed the responsibility over to decided I was no longer welcome at 'his party' (his words). The bellend even hired 2 security guards to stand on the door. 


So yeah, fuck that guy.

Sorry for the shit post. I needed to write it down as I am a little upset right now :( 

Happy holidays yo!



**EDIT** - Christmas is back on boys!!! 20+ people have left and are heading to the pub!!! :))) Word apparently got around as to the shenanigans pulled and people weren't too happy about it. I *do* have friends :) 

Thanks for your comments guys. The last couple of hours has been an emotional rollercoaster and without your comments coming in I probably would have cried real tears.

Heading to the pub :) Have a nice evening people x 

**EDIT 2** - Thanks again for all your awesome comments. 

Quick update - met all the best people in the pub, drank far too much and smoked a huge J on the seafront with good friends. Good times and I only spent £20. 

As for Matt (organiser, common ass name so..) it was wholly agreed he is a bell. Nobody knows why I wasn't invited and nobody can get an answer out of him regarding the matter. The general idea is that he wanted it to be 'his' thing, but who knows. Fuck that sassy prick but I still wish him a happy christmas. 

As for you, you glorious bunch of bastards. Your comments are awesome and have made me smile a great deal this evening. It genuinely means a lot.

A perfect chance to get a good run of wins as Burnley are a team struggling to score so maybe our defense can handle them.

Swansea were beaten by a weakened version of  our team in the League cup so we have the ability to beat them.

Leicester haven't won a match since they only United and have drawn/lost all other matches since.

Sunderland are a tough side that are defense heavy. After drawing to us I feel they may try play more attacking football since they may be less worried about us scoring against them which may open up their defense.

And Villa...I don't know about this one...I honestly can see them beating us again somehoe after they gave united trouble with only 10 men and were unlucky to lose",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Next Five League Matches,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2qap4x/next_five_league_matches/

Given that we've had a pretty respectable year, I figured we might as well throw our hats into the ring on this one. 

The categories under consideration are as follows: 

* **Best Contributor** (Top 2 will receive prizes)

* **Best Post / Comment**

There'll be two top-level comments under this post accepting nominations. You have a couple of days to submit them- we'll be handing out the gold creddits once we receive them in the New Year, I expect. Winners will be decided by votes- we'll be keeping Contest Mode on for the duration of the contest, so sorting'll be randomised/karma scores will be hidden- but we'll turn it off once we're handing out the prizes, so we can all see who's won out.

It's still early days, so this is more or less just an excuse to hand out reddit gold to some of our best and brightest- but, hey. Found someone's contributions to the place to be particularly outstanding over the past six months? Feel they deserve some recognition for what they've done? Let us know below!

Beyond that? Well. It's been a wonderful couple of months, and I do think we're just about building a community that's turning into something quite enjoyable here. Bravo to you all- it's a group effort, and we're seeing it start to pay off.

First of all happy holidays.  i'm a student in Edinburgh, and have been letting the same flat this and last year. Over the summer I go back to my home country so my landlord terminates my scottish power account and opens a new one come September.

In may, before leaving Edinburgh, I paid off all my scottish power bills, and Went home. 2 weeks ago however, I received a letter in the mail stating i owe them 1000£. I'm obviously upset about this because they sent me this bill TWO WEEKS AGO for energy consumption that finished in APRIL. I was given no prior notice, whether online or by mail about these charges, but I called them and they said it was consistent with whatever they were reading on their screens. Anyone else have experience with this sort of thing ?",false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,null,null,self,Scottish Power,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/2qas74/scottish_power/

I stay in east London and have been attempting to do longer routes out of London.
I don't know anyone else personally who enjoys long distant cycling, so I do the long routes by myself. This presents problems, the main problem being I am unfamiliar with the routes and roads and thus I get lost, or worse, find myself on a busy motorway. 
I am saving up for a decent GPS device, and I am also doing incremental rides: getting familiar with parts of a route, then turning back, then going back the following week to push further. This approach is obviously frustrating though, I just want to get on my bike and ride the whole day. 

I've been asking around and it seems a lot of the road cycling clubs in London focus on doing laps and getting fit and competing, but I'm looking for a real laid back club that focuses more on exploring, to go on long distances to explore the countryside. 

Can anyone give any suggestions for cycling clubs that go on the odd cycle out of London? The smaller the club the better I guess, I would just like to meet some people with a similar interest, to explore on the bike, in a slightly more organized fashion!

What with it being Christmas and all, ain't nobody got time to write a big ol' pre-match *and* prediction thread, so we're just going to have to live with another budget prediction thread! This also has the added bonus of giving more people time to take part during such a busy time. So, what's going to happen? Who's going to win? Will Bryan the Paraguayan ever get game time? And whose name will I misspell next in the prediction league table? Answers in yer text box, please!

If you haven't seen it yet, then do check out the recently published [December Predictions League Table](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeedsUnited/comments/2q7mev/who_is_rleedsuniteds_best_predictor_predictions/). We've reached game 23 and mockheroic is top of the standings with a mighty 10 wins, while ShutUpLou is leading the reverse league with a hefty -3 points. There's still all to play for, folks! If you want to take part then all you have to do is make a scoreline prediction (e.g. 2-0 to Leeds). Vague predictions (""Leeds to win"") will not be counted.

* 1) How hard are tickets going to be to get? Obviously it's the last game of the year but would it be a major struggle?
* 2) Is there anything I should do before game, whether it's visit somewhere or a place to eat?
* 3) Is there a certain section of Goodison Park I should try to get tickets for?
* 4) How accepting are local Everton fans of people from the US, even if I'm wearing my Everton jersey? I hear the fan sections can get pretty intense.

With the introduction of the Class 387/1s onto Thameslink services over the past few days it won't be long until additional 319s are released for cascade. This is the current information regarding 319 cascades including the destination of the units released by the 387/1s - unlike the 377/2s and 377/5s the 387/1s are not for additional capacity they're to directly replace 319s.

The following six units left for Northern at the start of summer:

319361

319362

319363

319364

319365

319380 (this was *initially* on lease from GTR however this will now stay with northern)

*These six units are at Allerton*

Four more are due to stand down by or on 06\12\14:

319368

319372

319379

319382

*This gives the 10 EMUs for Northern to run their electric December timetable. However due to network rails delays this will only start from mid January.*

The next 319s due to be released from GTR to Northern are rumoured to be:

*By the 31/01*
319013

319366

319455

319457

319460

**Giving 15 full units for the ManLiv diagrams**

Then by the 23\05\15 :

319215

319216

319367

319369

319386

319447

319371

319383

319375

319376

319441

319377

319378

**All 30 are for Northern** apparently for 24 diagrams for Manchester to Blackpoll (Preston most likely due to the Blackpool upgrade blockade.
