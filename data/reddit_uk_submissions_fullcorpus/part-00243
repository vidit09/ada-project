Please leave a comment below stating your prediction for the upcoming game. I need from you:

&gt;**(1) The Full time score (CLEARLY stating the winner; irrelevant if you think it'll be a draw)** 

&gt;**(2) The First goalscorer (irrelevant if you think it's a 0-0er)**

And the answer to the tiebreak:

&gt;**(3) The minute in which the first goal is scored.**

______________________________________________________
**Gold Pot:** 7 Months
_______________________________________________________

**Rules:**

* Victor will win the amount of Reddit Gold in the 'Gold Pot'
* If a contestant has guessed the first goalscorer and full time score correctly, they must PM me after the 90 mins are up to ensure valid entry. This PM must contain proof that they are an active /r/Liverpoolfc user.
* If you think the first goal scored will be an own goal, just write own goal and the minute. You do not need to say which team or player has scored it. 
* If two or more people have the same CORRECT predictions for the game, the winner will be the person closest with their tiebreak answer. 
* If there is no clear winner (no one guesses right or two or more entrants have the same prediction and result to the tiebreak question, the gold will be added to the 'gold pot' carry over to the following week)
* If more there's more than one correct guess of 0-0 the winner will be picked at random
* One entry per person
* Entry shuts an hour before kick off
* Entrants accounts must be older than 3 months
* No obviously edited answers (when the * appears)
* These posts will hopefully be weekly (funds permitting), but will not be posted at the same time each week to hopefully catch only /r/Liverpoolfc lurkers.
* This is obviously in it's infancy so there will be teething problems, please be patient with me.

I need this.  


To Mr. Moffat,

 And/or any and every member of the Doctor Who cast and crew,

This is the digital version of a hand-written letter.  I don’t own a printer and I need this letter to get to someone, and I appreciate long, hand-written letters are difficult and time-consuming to read.  

Due to the public nature of this letter I imagine some people may find me ridiculous, as Doctor Who is ‘just’ a television show, but as a person who has immense difficulty in feeling happiness, I’m a firm believer that if you are lucky enough to feel happiness in something healthy at all then you should damn well allow yourself to feel it, and not feel guilty about it.  

I am an Australian-born 24-year-old high school teacher who has recently moved to the UK.  A few years ago I drafted a letter to you and the Doctor Who crew to say thank you but I couldn’t figure out where to send it so it ended up sitting on my desk for a long while. My mother found it and, during an argument, referred to the letter and exasperatedly asked me why I was so manipulative and wanted people to feel sorry for me, as I had seemingly appeared to convey myself as in that letter. But this was not my intention.  I was just grateful for your work and was being honest.  Frustrated, I threw the letter away.  

This was about two years ago and I’ve since questioned that mother-daughter relationship and my former life, discovering that it wasn’t particularly healthy. Then one day I ran away to England, partly to escape and start again, but mostly because of Doctor Who. 

Like many young Australians who grew up well into the Doctor Who hiatus, I had, unfortunately, no appreciation for Doctor Who.  The show would come on at 6pm on the ABC and I would immediately change to Channel 10 to watch The Simpsons.  My litter sister – who is 10 years younger than me – shows my past feelings to Doctor Who best, as the household would know it was 6pm and the cartoons were finished because you would hear her five-year-old voice calling out “Mum, ‘boring’ is on!” until someone changed the channel. 

At the age of 22 I was preparing for my fist psychiatrist appointment and went through my childhood diary for content to take to my session.  I mentioned Doctor Who a lot and credited the show and my stories as “the only reason that kept me living”.  Yes, I was very melodramatic at times due to my experimenting with newfound knowledge of poetic and emotive language, and I can see why my mother thought I was being manipulative, but the unfortunate fact was that it was true.  I lived through Doctor Who.  

Like many people, from both functional and dysfunctional backgrounds, I dreamt of the TARDIS taking me away to escape my life and make me feel important.

Doctor Who taught me to ask questions. It taught me to fight, and that I was, or at least could be, important.  It made my world feel bigger and showed me there were better places to be.  I think people around me didn’t understand why I loved the show so much, but it was because I felt when I watched it. I am so thankful the Doctor Who idea exists, and so grateful to all the people, then and now, who have worked to create it.   I know I’m only really familiar with the revamped version, but I like to joke that ‘when I’m a rich teacher’ I’ll buy the older series.  

I went nine years with a very limited spectrum of emotion because of my home life.  Doctor Who was my lifeline; it gave me joy and I held onto it.  I literally started counting the days and hours and minutes to the next episode straight after each show ended.  Really.  It annoyed my friends at school.

It was, and always has been, the one thing in my life to consistently make me feel happiness without causing me to immediately feel guilty afterwards.  I never stopped loving it like I did with everything else, something sadly evident in my psychology. Even when a series ended I would feel happy for feeling sad, as it meant I had felt happy at all.  It also meant I had the next series to look forward to, and that made me feel less lost. 

I refer to myself in this nine-year period as being ‘asleep’.  Doctor Who woke me up for about 45 minutes every week.  I really hope you can understand what I’m trying to say.  I haven’t been capable of positive feelings for a very long time, so I tend to treasure them when I do feel them. 

So, to finish, I thank you will all that I am, to the entire cast and crew.   Thank you for making something so fantastic. Thank you for waking me up. Thank you for making me feel.

I promise this hasn’t been some kind of sneaky cover letter, but I really hope I find myself working or contributing in some way with you all some day.  

With the kindest and most sincerest of regards,

A grateful fan.

I'm thinking of having a separate breakdown/recovery policy so that i can build a discount over the years, rather than renewing it yearly with insurance.

**I'd need:**

* Homestart
* UK-Wide
* Take me to reasonable location of choice
* Roadside assistance (for things like punctures/lack of fuel)

**Would be nice:**

* Yearly discounts for not using it
* Western European cover (perhaps as an addon as-and-when)

I'll be looking into the obvious choices of; RAC/AA/Greenflag.

What seems most shocking is that mobile phone use is well established and researched regards driving and distraction. [It is illegal](http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/legal-advice/mobile-phones.html) because it is [dangerous](http://www.rospa.com/road-safety/advice/drivers/distraction/mobile-phones/) yet juries keep acquitting motorists of such cases. 

One blogger goes [into detail](https://beyondthekerb.wordpress.com/2015/03/21/somethings-not-quite-right-here/) about the above case and his worries. 

Some might think decriminalisation would be a good thing. But the stark facts remain that we can avoid causing a risk of other's suffering by being more aware, more sober and less distracted by phones and tech (sling the phone on the back seat when you drive - mine goes in a bag out of reach) 

You google ""driver acquitted"" for your country and its saddening. Thousands of cases, some of them involving deaths. I dont subscribe to the ""grace of god"" argument. There is always something we can do to mitigate risk.

Football and sports are major passions of mine, and I've been inspired by Micheal Cox (zonalmarking.net) and others to write about it!

I've set up a shitty wordpress site to publish things. At some stage I'll reassess publishing, but not a major deal atm.

Really I just want to share my love for sports, once or twice a week. I'll also be doing similar type stuff (game analysis and more broad articles) with AFL (I'm Melbournian remember) and maybe Dota2. On different sites.

Comments made within the first few hours of the thread being created stay at the top and newer posts closer to the time the game kicks off will be stuck at the bottom at will not really be relevant.

I'd suggest making a pre-match thread 24 hours before kickoff aswell as another thread 1 or 2 hours prior to kickoff.

Thoughts?

There has been a lot of rumours circulating about Pogba's future in the summer:

From bids from PSG
(http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2015/03/juventus-nedved-confirms-psg-bid-for-pogba/)

to Pogba speaking about Real Madrid """"Real Madrid are a club that is used to buying players like you buy a facecloth -- and then throws them away like a facecloth.""(http://www.espnfc.co.uk/juventus/story/2356114/paul-pogba-not-interested-in-real-madrid-movesays-agent-mino-raiola)

The comment about Real Madrid really made me think. It feels that Pogba enjoys being at a club where he feels he will be loved by the club and the fans.

Is it too much to dream about Pogba being a potential player for Liverpool. I'm really hoping Pogba wants to prove himself against Manchester United back in BPL and I know our fans will really love this player, especially his long shots (OH MY GOD).

But alas... A man can dream......

About 18 months ago I signed up to a welding course. The structure is that practical training is available in two week blocks which are arranged upon completion of a set number of theory modules. 

After completing the first 12 theory modules, I tried to organize the first two practicals weeks, but I was only able to do the first one at that particular time. They told me this was fine they would put me on a waiting list for the next one and contact me when it became available. This was in May last year, and I haven't heard back. I wrote them a letter recently, and they sent a letter back saying their records show that my next practical sessions are due after the completion of the next 12 theory modules, which isn't the case. I replied to that telling them this, and they just haven't replied. The last letter I sent which received no reply so far was about 2 weeks ago.

I will resend that letter in an email to make sure I have a record that they received it, and after that I am hoping that I have enough to go to the small claims court, but if I am wrong in any of this please correct me.

I'd like to invite you to check out /r/britishpolitics ahead of the general election. 

We're obviously smaller than the well established ukpolitics thats been around for donkeys years, but we have grown from only 150 to over 2100 subscribers in the last nine months when we applied for ownership of the sub after it had been left to languish for some years. [We even have a pretty active IRC channel!](https://client01.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.snoonet.org&amp;channel=%23BritishPolitics)

We subscribe to the idea of a moderated subreddit to keep discussion on the topic of the political developments at hand. I know a lot of people dont go for this, but it has proven surprisingly popular.

Feel free to drop by /r/britishpolitics (or IRC!) and dont be afraid of posting even if you know nothing about politics - we're generally a friendly bunch and will answer any questions you have.

You need to download the Workshop Tools Alpha by pressing the ""Custom Games"" button under the Play tab on Dota.


You then need to head to the Workshop and search for ""Pudge Wars"", the one with the pixelated icon on white is the one we'll use. It's rated 5 stars.

We have a teamspeak Channel which can be divided into seperate teams, or you can use in game, it's all for fun!

&amp;nbsp;

5 minutes to Kick Off!


1st min: Kick off

3rd min: early possession for United. Corner kinda cleared by mignolet

7th min: Moreno looses possestion then gives away a freekick in a dangerous position

11th min: Good spell for united. Comes to nothing as Sakho watches the ball out from a cross

14th min: **United score!!!!!!** Way to easy as through ball allows Mata to slot home

18th min: Ambitious effort by the Big D volleys wide

19th min: Allen gets a yellow for a professional tug back on Herrara

21st min: Awful class of heads as Jones rampages in on Lallana

26th min: United dominating the game atm

33rd min: Sterling beats Fellani to a header. Most noteworthy thing which has happened in last 5 mins.

34th min: **OMG** Great ball by Hendo who lays it off to Lallana who MISSES THE TARGET FROM 10 yards!! Big chance

36th min: Great pressure and intensity from Liverpool

47th min: **HALF TIME. Liverpool 0 - United 1**

&amp;nbsp;

Slow start by Liverpool. Begun to find our feet as the game went on. Pool still second best to every ball. It is good timing for a uplifting half time team talk 

&amp;nbsp;


45th:  **Kick off** Gerrard on for injured Lallana

46th min: **Im not sure what to say. Steven Gerrard got a red card 1 minute after coming on.**

47th min: It was the correct desicion by Atkinson. Terrible stamp by Gerrard

48th min: YNWA We are still in this lads. COME ON

53rd min: Liverpool not playing too badly atm. Sterling crosses slightly over Sturridges head. Can we do this?

54th min: Classic Coutiniho-esque effort just sails over

56th min: Phil Jones finally gets a yellow card. Could have been a red??

57th min: Di Maria who has just come on as a sub and forgets he is playing football and catches the ball. No yellow

58th min: **UNITED GOAL. WHAT A FINISH FROM JUAN MATA. BICYCLE KICK INTO THE CORNER**

&amp;nbsp;


**IM OUT GUYS** Good luck pool

&amp;nbsp;


69th min: **IM BACK - I never left.... honestly**



69th min: **LIVERPOOL GOAL - DANIELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL  STURRRIIIIIIIDGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

75th min: Immense pressure from liverpool. Leaving gaps at the back. Great game. Transfixing

77th min: Balo and Blind collide. Balo fuming. Pool Fans hold him back lol

90th min: **PENALTY TO UNITED: MIGNOLET SAVES**

94th min: **Sktel stamped on De Gea........ **

&amp;nbsp;

Not bad at all - if you haven't already bought a house and think you will in the future then you have 4 years to open one of these. There is no penalty for closing it without buying a house. You can cash in the account whenever you want.

Even with a lump sum you need a 5% ROI to beat this.

edit: it has come to my attention that merely answered the question if he would have signed a contract, didn't really blame the club. My bad.
 
Then he blasts Balotelli on ITV over the penalty incident. Why? Hardly bringing team harmony, that. 

He's been half as vocal on the pitch this season. I think he has mentally checked out of Liverpool. 

Don't get me wrong, I will remember the good days and will always love him but he sure is making it easy to not miss him next season.

Few months ago a big time deposit of mine expired. It occurred to me that that might mean tax liabilities.

I looked at HMRC websites, but exact details were not obvious to me.

Does anyone have any knowledge in that area? I presume I can deduct the tax already paid abroad? 

Are there any tax discounts available for foreign savings income?

It seems unfair and is extremely frustrating that I have to pay 40% of tax here in UK despite the fact that the time deposit was opened before I moved here, with money earned abroad which never entered UK.

It hurts me that the slip and this stamp will be the only thing remembered by the world. A bit similar to Zidane, new or future football fans will never see the brilliance in their prime ages. Gerrard will not be remembered because of Olympiakos, Istanbul, 06 fa cup or anything else. 


I can take all the mockery from my friends, trolls and rivalry fans. The ""slip"" cut my heart once. I don't want people only remember the slip and stamp when it comes to Gerrard. 


The worst thing is who am i supposed to be angry at? I understand Gerrard's frustration, the trolls got to be trolls, and rivalry fans has every right to mock. I just feel sad, frustrated and angry.

Here are 9 things that I came up with…

9. New Writers-
Moffat’s pretty much got this one covered. Although further speculation continues…

8. An Addition To The TARDIS Team-
Now, I don’t feel that this is a major concern, however wouldn’t it be fun if the Doctor had a Guinea Pig!

7. More Alien Encounters-
Probably something that Series 8 lacked as it seemed to concentrate on Droids and Robots. Something ‘Series 5-esque’ would be nice.

6. A Story-arc that doesn’t ruin Individual Stories-
	* Cough * Series 6 * cough *. Yeah, pretty self-explanatory.

5. No More Re-Hashes-
Anyone else think that Into The Dalek is pretty much a re-hash of Journey To The Centre Of The TARDIS? Didn’t really like either, to be honest.

4. More Exploration Into who the Twelfth Doctor really is-
After a mostly Clara-centric Series (Don’t shoot me I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, I love Clara too), an episode that really makes us question the Doctor’s sanity would be nail biting. Maybe even a Cliffhanger…

3. More Unit-
Ok, so this basically goes against Point No. 7 but wouldn’t it be unusual to have a Unit Story… IN SPACE!!!

2. 14 Episodes (including a Christmas Special)-
	Yes, I’m looking at you Moffat…

1. A Spin-Off-
The Paternoster Gang, Clara Who, Unit… BBC, You have so much to choose from.

Ok, so thanks for reading and remember to up-vote if you liked it. Also, Please comment below on what you think Series 9 needs to deliver on!

I need your advice here, I currently live in another city where travelling from one side of the city to the other is a bit stressful and I've just been offered the old family car for a much discounted deal. It would make my life so much easier here.

However, I've been planning on moving to Edinburgh between now and the next 12 months once I get a job (My plan is to actually move up or a year and work and then do my masters). How easy is it to live within Edinburgh (and the fringe towns) without a car? Is it even worth me getting one?

There are still 24 points to play for and a fixture list favoring us.

Of course a win today would have been monumental for our hopes for CL next season, but it's not over yet. A win against Arsenal would put us three points behind them and five points behind Man U (provided they don't slip up against Villa). So that means one slip up from either of those teams means we will be right back in this.

Let's not forget either that Arsenal and Man U are yet to play against eachother. 

So let's look at each teams fixtures:



**Liverpool FC**

Arsenal *away*

Newcastle *home*

Hull *away*

West Brom *away*

QPR *home*

Chelsea *away*

Crystal Palace *home*

Stoke *away*


**Arsenal FC**

Liverpool *home*

Burnley *away*

Chelsea *home*

Hull *away*

Swansea *home*

Man United *away*

Sunderland *home*

West Brom *home*

**Man United**

Villa *home*

Man City *home*

Chelsea *away*

Everton *away*

West Brom *home*

Crystal Palace *away*

Arsenal *home*

Hull *away*



Looking at the fixtures we have arguably the easiest schedule. Where as Man U has an incredibly tough schedule facing Arsenal, City, Chelsea and Everton. Arsenal also have a pretty tough one aswell. And we can't forget that Man City are only six points above us and are starting to lose form.

So a win against Arsenal will be extremely important for our top 4 hopes. Even if we lose or draw it's not completely over (but very slim). We are going to have to rely a lot on the teams above us ""slipping"" up and losing points.

It might feel hopeless now but at the end of the storm, there is a golden sky (hopefully).

Cheers and YNWA

We need an emotionally detached, brutal re-assessment this Summer with the squad, as I feel we are carrying too many passengers now.

I`m not sold on the badge kissing brigade, and I believe some very high profilers have run their course at City now. I`d list Toure, Nasri, Dzeko, Kolarov amongst those I wouldn`t be sorry to see go, and I think the club has acted rashly in dishing out certain new contracts.

On the brighter side, I do think we have some coming through that really need to be a part of our first team unit next season. Lopes, Rekik, Denayor, Pozo, and for a punt, Brandon Barker should all, in my opinion, be promoted and played whenever possible.

I think Milner will be moving on, and again I`ll be grateful for what he`s contributed, but see it as an opening to introduce new blood to the squad. With a fresh pair of eyes at it, City could lose a few high earning, inconsistent players and replace them from within. We`d have the funds then available to get in one or two absolute worldies to provoke the right reaction throughout those that remain at the club, and it`s something I feel we desperately need to do now.

Most of the current squad have had ample time to show their real worth, and natural selection has shown who`s up to the task and who isn`t. We have become rather staid and predictable. The football isn`t good enough, often enough, and I would like to see the club engage in a way that sends a clear message to the playing staff, no matter how big the name.",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,MEN reader summed up my feelings perfectly.,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/2zx83z/men_reader_summed_up_my_feelings_perfectly/

The car is a 2008 model, has 30,000 miles and the seller says that there was only one owner from new. The classified listing states that there is proof of mileage in all MOTs. The car has 12 months of MOT.

----------

Yesterday I messaged the seller with a few questions...


The seller doesn't have the full service history. The seller says that he has just had the car serviced due to having a new clutch put in. The logbook is also clear of Cat C and Cat D writeoff stuff.

----------

Should I avoid this car entirely, given it doesn't have the full service history?

Is there anything I can do to try and find out the service history etc?

Would I be alright to consider this car if I got it looked at by my garage or something?

----------

I really appreciate any help!

I stopped to take a look fearing the worst and sure enough the exhaust was rattling, looks like the downpipe/exhaust connection has sheared or came loose. At the tip of the arrow in this picture (hope link works), on the downpipe side of the joint.

It's not a great pic but can anyone tell me if this needs a weld or is it an easy fix? I'm not mechanically minded at all! 
I was going to buy a new slip on Arrow exhaust next week anyway, but like I say I think this problem is at the downpipe side of the joint so not sure what would make a difference anyway :S",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,default,ER6F 2009 - Broken downpipe/exhaust.

Besides the utter foolishness of gambling with the weather that could destroy the house at any time and she'd lose everything without insurance to cover the cost, what if a brick blows off the roof and hits a pedestrian? She would be liable for millions in compensation. But she insists that it isn't a legal requirement and that nothing bad will come of not having it. How do I convince her that she is wrong and get her to buy insurance? I am seriously freaking out about this. I don't want to report her to the council but if she leaves me no alternative then I have to. I really just need to convince her to get insurance before they find out.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,URGENT: How to get mum to buy home insurance,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2zxyg9/urgent_how_to_get_mum_to_buy_home_insurance/

So happy to see that there is a legal advice for the UK.
I am Danish and not quite sure about the rules in the UK.
I live here in Northern Ireland and I have a 12 month contract on a house which now are 3 months from the end of the lease.
The issue is now that both my flatmates are moving out and go home to there native countries and I therefore stand with a rent for myself which I would be able to pay but I would have barely to live for afterwards.
I looked up the rules which stated that unless its stated in the contract then it is not possible to end a lease, which are not in the contract.
I talked to the landlord who informed that I was responsible for the rent until the end of the contract but that I was allowed to sublet it to other people.
I also have a depositum which would be possible to use as covering for a months rent as house have just been fixed to better condition then before we moved in.
Might be a stupid question but I just wanted to hear other peoples view on the situation and if you had any advice before I do anything.

However as i was doing so, i heard something rustle in the bushes behind me. I looked around and i couldn't see anyone, no one was walking behind me or infront. A few moments later i heard this loud rattling sound, similar to that of a rattle snake, that went on for about 20 seconds coming from behind one of the trees. 

I was scared shitless, i'd never heard anything like that before. Thinking about the sound sends chills down my back.  I ran as fast as i could towards the ESSO garage and looked back when i was at the opening. I saw a dark figure running up the path towards me about 40 metres back.

It could have been nothing, but it also could have been something. So i'm just posting this to ask you all to be careful and vigilant when going through there. Even if you have your dog with you. Something isn't right.

So me and my other half and looking at getting a property to renovate and sell on, but we have never bought a house before and are unsure on a couple of issues. 

Some background info:

I 50% own a house (brother owns other 50% but is in Australia) so I pay all bills at £320 P/M.
We own the house outright as we inherited it from our late mum. It is worth around £180k.

I currently earn £15,600 (after tax and NI) a year from a business I part own, and I work full time around 40 hours a week.
I have £19,000 in savings (£52k in the business which I should get back eventually, but not in the near future)

My girlfriend works 40 hours a week and earns around about £17,000 (after tax and NI).
She has around £12,000 in savings and pays £80 p/m in rent to her parents. 

So overall we have around £31k in savings to spend on this project.

We're looking at a house for around £52,500, so with a 20% deposit it will be a mortgage of £42,000 and we will have around £20k left to develop the house. We are budgeting £5-6k for the renovation. 

The estate agent has said we could sell the house for between £70-75k once it is finished, but we are expecting between £65-70k (being pessimistic).

Now the costs that we have accounted for are for the following:

* Legal Fees (for buying) - £500
* Mortgage Fees - Between £0 - £1000
* Early Repayment Fee's - £840
* Selling Fees - £800 
* Legal Fees (for selling) - £500

So this varies between £2650 and £3650.

So this takes the overall spend to between £7650 and £9650, which leaves us with an overall spend (before mortgage payments) of between £60,000 and £62,000.

If we walked away with £3k profit it wouldn't be worth our time, but I would be happy with £8k or more.

Are we missing anything in all of this? We want to make an offer on the house of £48k, and hopefully we will get that so we can add it to the bottom line.

I'd appreciate any advise or tips on this from people who have done anything similar too.

However, what you don't realise is that whenever you click on this crap you improve the position of that story in the search engines and worsen the position of real journalism - you are literally creating an incentive for them to produce worse and worse content.

These are the positions that LFC should improve on this upcoming summer. 

Back up GK
RWB
CDM/CM
CB
ST

These are the players I recommend LFC should look at:

Back up GK: I don't know many good ones out there, but we should look at a experienced GK for the cheap.

RWB: Daryl Janmaant(Newcastle), he's Newcastles best player this season,and he's got PL experience too. Janmaat can make runs and he is better defensively than Ibe/Markovic or anyone we have playing RWB right now.

CDM/CM: Morgan Schneiderlin(Southampton), Southamptons best player, he's a CDM/CM hybrid, he would be great alongside Henderson in the midfield.

CB: Tobey Alderweireld(Atletico Madrid player on loan at(you know it lol) Southhampton) I'm a believer of Can in the CB position, I feel like he gives LFC an extra dimension when it comes to passing from the back, plus Janmaat would be better at covering Can's ass when he makes a mistake. Anyways Tobey wouldn't be nothing revelational and he's out of favor at Atletico , but he specializes at the RCB position and he's played at every top level out there, plus Atletico would probably sell him for a cheap price.

ST: Vietto(Villarreal), yes I know everyone and his mother want's this guy, but he allegedly has a buy-out clause for about 20 million euros and we can still attract young players. He plays a lot like a young Suarez so it's only natural LFC would be interested in him.

Players leaving the club:

Gerrard- duh

Johnson- duh

Borini- If he won't leave LFC this summer, then this kid is fucking delusional.

Aspas- talked shit about LFC, he can go.

Luis Alberto- time to cut our losses, I don't see him doing good in the EPL.

Lambert/Balotelli: Only one of them should leave, rather have Balotelli leave since his wages are higher.

The starting IX: (3-4-3)

................................Mignolet.................................

...........Can................Skrtel...............Sakho...............

Janmaat.........Henderson.....Schnedierlin.........Moreno

.................Sterling.....................Coutinho............

................................Sturridge........................

Sub/Bench/Reserves:

Lovren

Ibe

Vietto

Markovic

But every mention of this subject seems to refer again and again to the fact that stuff like men's razors and weird meat are tax-free, and sanitary products are classed as 'luxury items' and therefore have VAT associated with them. For ages now I've used these facts in casual conversation like it's common knowledge, but trying to find some actual sources, I can't find any evidence that supports either of these claims. 

[The gov.uk site on VAT](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-shopping'/vat-duties) says that we pay 20% on most things, but 'less on essential items' (i.e. 5% or nothing), and on the [list of reduced rates](https://www.gov.uk/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services#health-education-welfare-and-charities) we see sanitary products are taxed at 5%. 

There's no mention of 'luxury' goods, only the standard VAT rate that applies to most things you buy, and the only mention of 'essential' is on the first page; there is nothing to suggest that anything on the list is essential (well, I mean gambling is apparently exempt which surely means it's not a list of 'essential' things), apart from the fact that some things clearly are (like children's clothing or food in general). 

And there's nothing about men's razors, which should mean they're taxed at the standard rate of 20%. I'm not exactly familiar with the gov.uk website; is there a page I'm missing, or has it just been left off the list or something? 

The crocodile meat, etc stuff is fair game, since sweets, fast food, etc are taxed at 20%. Maybe it just hasn't made the list yet?

I guess it seems to me that VAT as a whole is a bit inconsistent, either because of umbrella terms like 'food' or historical residue like 'men rule the world'. Or both. Does that sound about right?

I don't think his particular skillset fits anywhere with this formation and wherever he plays it leaves us lacking something. He isn't defensive enough to play in the 2, or with a good enough range of passing or shooting. He isn't a winger, he's not likely to take a player on and create something in the final third. At his best he is a box to box midfielder with incredible stamina and ability to carry the ball forward, and generally has his best games when the match is stretched and end to end, which is pretty rare over the course of the season. 


This weekend against Hull Ramires was shocking in central midfield in my opinion. It once again showed him up for his poor first touch, and his poor ability to move the ball efficiently. Just looking up his pass completion stats, which I think aren't always good for showing a player played well, but are for showing when a player has played poorly, [and he sits at a team low of 60%](http://i.imgur.com/wHlZiVh.jpg). Defensively he made only attempted two tackles in the game, and made zero interceptions, so I struggle to see what he brought to the team. 


Now we don't have a lot of other options, we could play Oscar at number 10 and move Fabregas back to partner Matic, but Oscar has been playing quite poorly himself recently so I can see why Mourinho is trying to freshen things up. You can play Zouma in midfield but as much as he tries hard you can really tell he isn't a midfielder. The last option I see is giving Loftus-Cheek minutes. This is a guy that has fantastic technique on the ball, he is able to quickly control the ball, to make a range of short of long passes, and effectively run with the ball at his feet. He also has the athleticism and physicality to match up to Premier League footballers despite his young age. The only thing you can hold against him in my opinion is his lack of experience, however everyone has to start somewhere. Chelsea's academy teaches its midfielders to play all three roles in central midfield, as a 6 (holding midfielder: Matic), as an 8 (box to box/playmaker: ramires/fabregas), and as a 10 (playmaker: oscar/fabregas), which helps to give them a well rounded education and skill set. From everything I have seen Loftus-Cheek seems a perfect player to play that number 8 role if we don't want Fabregas there, he doesn't have the passing that Fabregas brings (few in the world do), but he definitely brings the physicality and defensive side of the game that Fabregas doesn't, and is a huge upgrade on Ramires in terms of his on the ball work. 


As some may have noticed I am extremely high on Loftus-Cheek, and I most probably do overrate him, but having watched Ramires once again put in a diabolical performance in our central midfield I just can't imagine Loftus-Cheek playing worse than that. He has all the tools he needs to really take over that position and be a key squad player for Chelsea if only he's given the chance. I can't help but feel other managers would give him that chance that Mourinho most likely won't, but that's just one of the (potential) downsides to Mourinho that we have to live with. He trusts experience over anything else.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Loftus-Cheek vs Ramires,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/2zzpyz/loftuscheek_vs_ramires/

So me and my other half and looking at getting a property to renovate and sell on, but we have never bought a house before and are unsure on a couple of issues.

Some background info:

* I 50% own a house (brother owns other 50% but is in Australia) so I pay all bills at £320 P/M. We own the house outright as we inherited it from our late mum. It is worth around £180k.

* I currently earn £15,600 (after tax and NI) a year from a business I part own, and I work full time around 40 hours a week. I have £19,000 in savings (£52k in the business which I should get back eventually, but not in the near future)

* My SO works 40 hours a week and earns around about £17,000 (after tax and NI). She has around £12,000 in savings and pays £80 p/m in rent to her parents.

So overall we have around £31k in savings to spend on this project.

We're looking at a house for around £52,500, so with a 20% deposit it will be a mortgage of £42,000 and we will have around £20k left to develop the house. We are budgeting £5-6k for the renovation.

The estate agent has said we could sell the house for between £70-75k once it is finished, but we are expecting between £65-70k (being pessimistic).

Now the costs that we have accounted for are for the following:

* Legal Fees (for buying) - £500
* Mortgage Fees - Between £0 - £1000
* Early Repayment Fee's - £840
* Selling Fees - £800
* Legal Fees (for selling) - £500

So this varies between £2650 and £3650.

This takes the overall spend on the house to between £7650 and £9650, which leaves us with an overall spend (before mortgage payments) of between £60,000 and £62,000.

If we walked away with £3k profit it wouldn't be worth our time, but I would be happy with £8k or more.

Are we missing anything in all of this? 

We want to make an offer on the house of £48k, and hopefully we will get that so we can add it to the bottom line.

I'd appreciate any advise or tips on this from people who have done anything similar too.",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,Me and SO are looking at getting,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2zzqin/me_and_so_are_looking_at_getting/

What was the psychological impact?

Going into detail about my current situation (hence the throwaway): I've got about £6.5k sitting in a S&amp;S ISA that I regularly contribute £250/mo to (effective interest rate right now of 8%) and a student loan balance, taking into account payments I've made this year, of £6.1k. Monthly payments on the are about £240 and it's a 1.5% interest rate.

I've always been a debt-averse person - the only other debt I have is my mortgage (yes I'm overpaying the maximum on that). I also have a reasonable emergency fund saved up which is around £4k right now. 

Would paying off the student loan with the ISA leave me worse off *financially*? Yes, absolutely. The £240/month that's going to a student loan would be added to the £250/month that goes to my ISA so my disposable income would stay the same. But *mentally*? That's what I want to find out from people on here.

The time period I'm looking at is the last 6 gameweeks (the same exact period as Lucas has been injured and Sturridge has returned). The previous post was also covering 6 gameweeks.

As you can see in the old post we were doing great from middle of December to middle of January, suddenly topping most of the stats tables both going forward and defending compared to earlier in the season.

Our attacking stats compared to the previous period (last 6 gameweeks):

* We had the lowest minute per chance (4.9 minutes) in the league, but now we have dropped to 7.5 minutes per chance, placing us at rank 11 in the league (City leads with 4.5 followed by Southampton, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and United).

* We had the most shots on target in the league (42) but now we are placed fifth with 30 shots on target behind City(48), Arsenal, Tottenham and United.

* We were in the top 5 for Big Chances Created but now we are ranked 10 in the league with 8 big chances, City and Tottenham are leading with 18, followed by Arsenal with 17 and United with 14.

* We were ranked 2nd for shots in the box (65) but in the last 6 gameweeks that number has dropped to 37 (!!) placing us 15th in the league, City is leading with 74 ahead of Arsenal, Palace, Southampton and United.

It is some pretty clear numbers showing that yesterday wasn't ""just 1 loss after being unbeaten, people are overreacting"", but that we have regressed quite a bit in the last couple of months. People might suggest that we had more difficult fixtures but our numbers are not noticably better for our games against Swansea and Burnley than against City, United, Tottenham etc. 

As I wrote before the biggest difference to the team in this period has been Allen coming in for Lucas and Sturridge returning to place Sterling on the RWB and MArkovic on the bench (and Ibe injured). I'm not sure of course but I think that we formation change from 1 DM to Henderson+Allen playing together infront of the defense is an important factor to our declining attacking numbers. When we play with Allen or Lucas as a DM instead it allowes Henderson to move further up the pitch to create room for other players, make runs into the box etc. 

The statistics (created chances, shots on target etc) for all our midfielders have dropped in the last 6 gameweeks, and most noticably for Henderson. In terms of being involved going forward his numbers are around 40% of what they were when we played with a DM. Lucas is as we know back from injury and I think his return will fix a lot of these problems since he is better suited to play as a lone DM than Allen, and the return of Ibe soon will hopefully allow Sterling to play in a more prefered position.


Our defense is still doing very good statistically of course so I won't go into too much detail on that, we're conceded the top 3 least chances in the league and have made 1 defensive error and 0 defensive errors leading to a goal in the last 6 gameweeks, very good!

This was maybe a bit too long but I always find it interesting to look at the underlying statistics, specially when our performance is changing. What are your guys thoughts on these changes? I have seen people here say that we have struggled for some weeks now and ""wonder goals"" have saved us, which these statistics sort of support. As I've said earlier I think that our attack is missing Lucas more than our defense since Henderson has been forced to stay back much more.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,A new look at the underlying statistics in the last 1-2 months - is our attack missing Lucas / the diamond?,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/3001bb/a_new_look_at_the_underlying_statistics_in_the/

I've been working with my girlfriend over the past few months to create a virtual art gallery within Unity3D with the aim of showing local artists works. 
We're currently living in Brighton, UK, so all of the works are from artists who live or have recently studied around here.

My girlfriend is a curator of a series of multidisciplinary art experiments and was interested in virtual spaces and widening the visibility of local artists. I'm a game designer / app developer. So this was a new and exciting experience for the both of us.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek - the latest candidate - looks every inch the archetypal Premier League midfielder, with many fans on this sub clamouring for him to be thrown into the fire now. He’s technical, sure, so how much worse can he do than some of our current senior options? The development track of Kurt Zouma suggests that we’re perhaps employing a slightly facile view towards the integration of youngsters into our first team.

Let’s look at the similarities: The main argument for Loftus-Cheek’s immediate inclusion currently is that he’s technically and physically ready for the Premier League. If you look back to Zouma’s arrival to the first team about 9 months ago, the very same can be said for him; he’s an incredible physical specimen with incredible defensive technical abilities to boot.

Yet here lies the divergence. Zouma arrived at Chelsea having made more than 70 senior appearances in the French Ligue 1; a league that’s probably slightly inferior to that of the Premier League. This was a youngster heralded as one of the best defensive talents of his generation with a concomitant price tag, and even so, when he arrived at Chelsea, it was obvious that he wasn’t ready.

If you watched Zouma very early on in the season, the mental facets of the game seemed to be lacking; he frequently struggled with positioning, and occasionally looked reluctant in making challenges perhaps in fear of making a mistake. He had a penchant of misjudging the flight of the ball; two notable occasions come to mind - against Bolton and against Liverpool when he let Sterling in (he ultimately recovered the ball)- and some other positioning errors that were indicative of a player who was not yet ready to start regularly in the Premier League.

The play time he received in smaller, less important games ultimately was incredibly conducive to his development. Slowly, under the tutelage of Terry and Mourinho, those issues began to dissipate, and the reason we had paid 12 million for his talents soon became evident. His development culminated in Mourinho’s bold move (by his standards, at least) of starting him against Liverpool in a League Cup semi-final. Even then, he made two notable errors in an otherwise highly impressive game: the aforementioned incident when he let Sterling in, and when Coutinho left him for dead only for Courtois to save with his feet.

I’m writing extensively about Zouma just to highlight the vast divergence between youth and senior level, at a club that demands an incredibly high standard from its youngsters, no less. A player like Zouma, every bit as physically and technically talented as Loftus-Cheek struggled with the demands of Premier League football even with 70+ senior appearances in a top league under his belt, whereas Loftus-Cheek has all but 8 minutes.

What ultimately enabled Zouma to succeed was the amount of time he got in “easier” games. He learned from his mistakes quickly to grow into a serious rival for Gary Cahill. I'd opine that it’s absolutely imperative that Loftus-Cheek gets a similar trajectory into the senior squad. RLC may is highly talented, but this certainly doesn’t strike me as the correct method of integrating him into our senior squad. We shouldn’t let the dearth of youth products delude us into believing that he’s better and more ready than he actually is at this point.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Zouma and RLC; why the latter isn't ready to be thrown into the fire,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/3003ed/zouma_and_rlc_why_the_latter_isnt_ready_to_be/

Long shot, I know, but posting here too just in case. My motorbike was stolen from my driveway between 11pm last night and 11am today (23/3). I live just off Gloucester Road in Bishopston. It's a red honda CBR600-F with reg F755 MLY. If anyone sees it around, is offered it for sale or sees it on anything like gumtree or ebay then please PM me or notify the police.

Thanks!

UPDATE: BIKE HAS BEEN FOUND! Thanks to everyone for their help!

This is not breaking news to anyone who has watched us, but I feel it's a good time to discuss why and how to fix it. 

We have allowed 45 goals in the PL so far. 

To put that in context, Newcastle has allowed 48, Burnley 49, QPR 54, and Leciester 48. 

The team at the bottom of the table has only allowed three (3) less more goals than us!

There's been a great deal of frustration expressed over our inability to keep a clean sheet. With one of the top 5 keepers in the world, we've kept 6 clean sheets this season, winning 4 of those games. 

Obviously, the GD hurts us right now seeing as we're tied with Southampton on points, behind on GD.

I'm trying to figure out exactly where the issue lies. 

We know Poch plays a high line, we know he likes to press. These are going to open us up to more chances than AVB's ""Let them come to us"" style. So, is the system to blame?

When you look at the individual players on our back line, it seems like we should be better off. Vertonghen, though he hasn't been totally up to par recently, is a good defender. Solid on the ball, good tackler, quick enough to get back. Dier is incredible for his age. I can see him being a Laurent Blanc type of defender. Rose has been, arguably, our best defender this season. Walker's not been amazing by any means, but save a couple games (Saturday's for example), he's not been utter shit. Coupled with Hugo, you'd think this back line would be far more effective. 

Is it the CMs fault? Do we put it on the wingers? 

Obviously, it'll be a combination of things. I'm just wondering what people put it down to.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Defensive Troubles: 45 goals allowed in the PL.,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/300a7m/defensive_troubles_45_goals_allowed_in_the_pl/

South Sudan has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since December 2013. On one side is the government of President Salva Kiir Mayadit (Sudan People's Liberation Movement) and its' allies; on the other side is former Vice-President Riek Machar (Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition) and his backers. As some observers warned might happen at the time, the euphoria and optimism that attended South Sudan's independence in July 2011 has quickly been shattered. At least 2.5 million people currently face crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity. 1.5 million people have been internally displaced. An estimated 60,000 people have been killed. With the price of oil down and oil exports in decline, the country's economy is in a parlous condition.

Naughton was involved a lot, which  honestly doesn't surprise me, as he was our best defensive fullback. Vertonghen starts in almost every win/loss/draw this year so he's obviously there a lot. Fazio Vertonghen seems to be best CB partnership and the Davies/Rose competition is awesome.

My questions are in relation to our situation and application fees. I gather that application fees include such things as credit checks and guarantor checks etc.  
I work full time, and although I'm still entrenched in my student overdraft, I have never been late on my phone bill, rent, utilities etc. My parents are currently acting as guarantors and they're happy to continue to do so for a while longer for both me and my SO (if that's doable?). Basically, I'm pretty sure that I'm good for any checks that they might chuck at me.  
My SO is an American, currently in the UK on a student visa. She is working part time (16 hours a week) while she finishes her masters degree and earns enough to cover rent and bills. Basically we are unsure if she will pass the checks that the letting agents will do, based on her visitor status and her part-time job.

I moved to the UK about 6 months ago with my Partner, and have been working since. Naively, I assumed that being young with a solid job I would have no problem getting credit, which I was declined for (a small personal loan). At this point I started researching and organised getting a credit report from callcredit, as they were the only company that would accept me not providing three years worth of UK addresses (which of course, I don't have). I was a ltitle surprised to see my credit score was 1/5 from them, although I understand now why. I was registered to vote, and have two direct debits coming from my bank account, but that is all that is visible on my report. There were also soft searches for comparing the cost of car insurance quotes on MoneySupermarket, but these shouldn't be visible or taken into account as far as I'm aware.  

I decided to apply for a credit builder card (had been 2 months since I was declined the personal loan), and today I was declined a credit builder card from Barclays, who of course can't tell me why, other than the fact there was a problem with my Experian report. I tried getting a report from Experian when my loan was declined, but they've told me they need more information and I will get a letter from them, which I haven't received. I've contacted them again today to ask for the letter.

I don't know what else I can do, the impression I got was that the card I was applying for would be given to you as long as you weren't recently bankrupt, and yet I've been declined for even that.

*0-2* **Sam Magri** - Video goal time: 1.38.55

------------------------------

Palace have brought another 3-points back to South London after a scrappy game against Barnsley. De Silva opened the scoring early on with a fine finish inside the box whilst Magri secured the points in the closing stages of the game.

Palace now lead the southern division by 2 points with a game in hand over Swansea City.

I was under the impression that a Labour government plans to continue austerity, but with some differences (e.g. more burden on the wealthy, less cuts to public services, ringfencing NHS, more modest deficit targets, etc...)

Do you think this statement regards any change in policy from Labour or does Miliband mean he intends to end 'Tory austerity' and institute 'Labour austerity'?

Related question: I believe I read somewhere that Labour planned to not inflict cuts on anything that acts as a kind of a fiscal multiplier... Could anybody clarify this?

Been trying to buy a ticket home for easter. When I select a return journey, my outgoing ticket is 40 quid, and my return is like 80 quid (so 120 total)

The return is crazy long due to engineering works so I made the journey one way, now suddenly the same outgoing ticket is now 80 quid. How does that figure?

I use the trains nearly every weekend and this is the first time I've come arcoss this.

Even home secretary Theresa May herself said it is much more serious and deep rooted than the public knows. Basically in the past 40 years or so a group of high up powerful people have been abusing, occasionally murdering hundreds perhaps thousands of children here in the UK.

This has not gone unnoticed. Scotland Yard are currently under investigation for covering up any investigations or allegations on these paedophile elites. Multiple government funded investigations have been set up only to fail miserably as people in charge of the investigations turn out to be closely associated sometimes directly related to the people who are accused. People investigating have been threatened with their careers/lives being destroyed. Some of those accused have been high profile public figures of authority and representing the British people. You of course will of heard of Jimmy Saville and how much blame has fallen upon him since the moment he died and yet these allegations include but are not limited to: Members of the Royal family, MPs both retired, dead and still currently in office, TV/radio celebrities dead, retired and still serving. The list goes on and on and that's just the ones we know about.

Some of you may think 'well that's just what it was like back then, none of that is still happening today' and yet today the UK government has decided that immunity will not be given to anyone who comes forwards and whistle blows on past or current information as this is all classified from being made public as it may 'jeopardise national security'. Even Theresa May voted for no immunity despite her apparent stance against child molesters. This in short is a thinly veiled threat to anyone who was thinking of coming forward: Come forward and you may be prosecuted for breaking the official secrets act.

Our politicians, the people who lead and represent us to the world, are actively covering up for, defending and quite possibly are people who sexually abuse children. One of the most disgusting and morally reprehensible crimes that a human can do. And yet we the people, the 99%, either do not know or do not care. 

We should be out in our millions screaming for these vile people to be brought down, for justice to be served. If we just sit around and shrug our shoulders nothing is going to be done about it, a few of their dead or dying will be used as scapegoats to quell what public anger there is and the rest will continue to walk free and continue to commit their monstrous crimes.

If you care: Share or tell people who do not know, one voice will not be heard but a million voices in front of parliament with pitchforks and burning torches surely will.

Friends mother claims we should pay for the damage, including to replace the high value items under the bed.

Q1. As my childs friend was sitting on my daughters knee, she is the one acting irresponsibly and therefore my child is not responsible for any damage caused.

Q2. My daughter did not do anything abnormal on the bed concerned, so it is it really her problem? 

Q3. The bed frame broke and not the slats, so can I reasonably say neighbour should take it up with her household contents insurer (if any) or the bed supplier on the basis the bed had a defect?

English media also tend to exaggerate, and it always seems a little bit more covered when it's Liverpool. Maybe they love to hate, maybe I'm just sensitive, I don't know. In the few days after, I hate everything even remotely considered journalism on the internet regarding LFC.

But this sub is full of people who really know about the game, the club, and the few who talk about the damn match rather than get caught up in the hyperbole and the headlines. It's warming and special to see people remain optimistic and band together when the whole world laughs outside and pokes at you. It really resonates with me.

This club is different, the fans are different. There's a real affinity between player and supporter, as Balo found out yesterday and other players like Gerrard and Alonso know, to name but a few. We know when to support our own and appreciate our rivals and opposition, despite whatever history they may have with our club. We're not perfect, we have our plastics and our muppets just like any other club, but we shout just as loud for compassion, understanding and support as some do for the one-off bad performance and managerial sackings.

I'm proud to be a LFC supporter, and I'm really happy I found this sub. Reading through the threads about yesterday's match has made me feel a lot better, knowing that there's a lot of good to take from yesterday and that I'm not alone thinking that Gerrard deserves our support despite his idiocy. It happened, and it will happen again by someone else.

Man United came with an early plan of removing the passion and emotion from the game which always suits an away team and they did it well. However, I don't think we currently have the players to get the crowd excited- I don't remember one feisty tackle in the first half which is pretty strange for a Liverpool - United game.

How can we add this to our game when we need it? Gerrard is leaving at the end of the season and Balotelli, who I think can add this, doesn't look close to being a first team starter under Brendan. All our players are a bit too nice! Coutinho, Allen and Hendo can all look after themselves but I can't remember any of them ever doing a sliding challenge.

tl;dr: we need some more aggressive players in the team.

(I realise the obvious answer is ""speak to a mortgage advisor about the specifics"" which we will be doing, but going in I would like to have a more clear understanding! Also... apology for the upcoming wall of text, I'm not very concise!


We live in a desirable, but rural area and so the number of properties on the market that will fit our criteria are limited. This has meant we are in the process of offering for a property needing modernisation throughout for around £380K. We will carry out cosmetic work (new kitchen/bathroom/decorations/boiler etc) in the short term, with a long term aim to do around £50K structural work (2 story extension and some internal rejigging) to make the house our ideal...


 Now as it stands, we have been very, very lucky to be offered significant help from my partner's family to take our 10% deposit (with a separate fund for the fees/move in work) up over the 40% LTV threshold to allow us to access the lower interest rates. Budgeting in these lower payments per month and being a bit more frugal will allow us to save up for the work much more quickly, 3/4 years.


When first applying for a mortgage obviously the value of the house is in its current, rather than potential state - as a rough guide we would look to fix for the first 4 years, do the renovations and development and then remortgage with a new valuation.


For our initial mortgage our thoughts are it is best to initially take out a long term one (say 39 years) overpay when we have spare cash and complete the structural work before the fixed rate time period is up and whilst we still have v.low interest rates. We could then remortgage onto a much shorter rate if the rates have risen as expected? Is our thinking correct on this or is there a more sensible way to take advantage of the combination of interest rates/savings and increasing property value......

I was back on my bike for the first time today after having it garaged for winter. My ride to work (16 miles) was fine, no problems whatsoever - was great to be back on it; but on my ride home, just 1 mile from home I had a loss of power while doing 60mph on a dual carriageway, it was a total loss - had to pull over quickly. The bike eventually stalled, but I was able to restart it, and nurse it home - same thing happened again moments later, but releasing the throttle briefly and not revving too high kept it going... Any ideas what it could be?


I started it up every week or two while garaged, and like I said, it was fine this morning!

It's a 2007 YBR-125.

Thanks!

I graduated in 2014 and I'd like to go backpacking for 3-4 months solo through South America in the near future. 
I am worried however that it will hurt my chances of starting a good career afterwards? 

I worked hard at uni - I don't want to throw that away.

I am 24 with a 2.1 from a good university, I've spent my time since graduating in an internship and sub-graduate level jobs but still gaining new skills + saving up money. I think I want to go into management consultancy or similar (no work exp. in this though).

With all our restrictions lifted next year, I've realised were going to have to up our quotas with transfers this coming season. Currently our homegrowns are Boyata, Hart, Lampard, Clichy, Wright and Milner. Sinclair and Guidetti also qualify but are on loan atm, but as far as I can tell both look likely to leave after this season, as are Milner and Lampard. 

So basically my worries are home-grown capacity. This doesn't mean buying over-priced englishmen like sterling, henderson or wilshere like the media seems to think we need, but tactical transfers - something which I'm afraid i really don't trust Txiki to get done.

I don't think a player can count as homegrown until he actually turns 21, even if he's played the 3 seasons necessary to qualify, so that rules out alot of the players we'd be looking to promote next season (pozo, lopes, denayer, rekik all under 21). Also, interesting to add, I think Pogba would actually qualify as homegrown due to his time with united before he was 21, but i can't say for certain.

I proceeded with the govenment scheme for energy saving installations last year.

In the first wave of home improvement fund vouchers I had 2 measures installed from the pre-approved list. I had a condensing boiler with an integrated flue gas recovery unit installed. This satisfied two measures from the list. Everything got approved and it was installed about 6 months ago.

Fast forward to last month. I had an email from the green deal team asking for my GDAR ref no. I obtained this from my installer and gave it to the team this morning. My case has been referred back to the claims team as they cannot see the recommendation of the flue gas unit on the EPC report. I had yet to forward the money onto my installer that had been paid to me from the green deal team.

I advised my installer today that I could not pay him the money I had received until this discrepancy had been resolved. He is threatening to file a small claims court application unless I make 50% of outstanding payment to him tonight. 

It looks like the installer messed up the application or the claims team made an error with approving the application and issuing the vouchers - or both of these things.

While this work is being done, the council has also allowed plans to have road works carried out down the bottom end of the Chester Road, the second junction for the M6. These two junctions are the main Junctions for the M6 serving most of central and central north Birmingham. 
Recently i got a newsletter through the post from a local MP. In the newsletter it mentioned the councils lack of planning towards these road works, it also mentions the fact that the council did no prior tests to see if the road networks could handle the increase in cars, and what the effects of the increase would be on traffic on the road networks. 

As im sure everyone is aware, this has caused serious congestion around castlebrom/castle vale, it has also been poorly managed. Spitfire island is a disaster, usually becoming gridlocked for short periods of time, not only affecting chester road, but all connecting roads as well. On top of that, the council seem reluctant to put in some sort of traffic light system or any traffic control measurement, just allowing the congestion to continue. 
I personally have seen a major increase in car accidents along this road, i use it daily and before this i rarely, if ever saw an accident. Since the roadworks, i personally have seen 5 accidents and would like to know if its possible to find out exactly how many accidents have occurred since the roadworks began. 
Its a write off, poor planning, that could and does, have the potential to cause death. The roads are too dangerous, the diversions aren't capable of handling this increase in passing traffic and something needs to be done.
In my eyes, someone, somewhere is responsible for this disaster, and they should be disciplined, and held responsible for something that could easily of been avoided.

The run down basically. 
I've hired a developer who was supposed to create me a plugin for my website with a timeline of 2 weeks. This project started on January 27th. The developer missed the initial 2 week timeline, but stated it would be done at the end of the month, the Feb 24th timeline was surpassed and I was given a final March 15th timeline... this of course was not met as well. 

The developer has not been able to show me any progress work he has done for the plugin, all he claims is that he's completed the ""framework"" 

I'm fed up with this skid of a developer trying to string me along. 

I paid via paypal balance, so a chargeback from my bank or PayPal account will be pointless considering I will lose this claim. I should note that there is no actual contract in place, nothing signed, however there is an invoice with an estimated completion date etc. I've been told this invoice should be sufficient with regards to a contract.

I am considering using MCOL (money claim online) in the UK, however I am not a UK resident and therefore don't think I'm eligible. 

The funds were 395 gbp as an initial deposit, however I do not feel this ""developer"" even deserves this as he has produced nothing and provided 0 updates to me.

My MAIN questions are, as a Canadian, how would I go about proceeding with legal action against this ""developer"". I have been told MCOL would be the way to go, however I don't think I can do this as I am not a resident. I am not 100% concerned with getting my money back in its entirety, especially if I have to pay some form of legal fees to do so. Are there any other avenues to take that I could utilize to get my money back? This developer is clearly a scam artist and upon researching and discussing with past employers, he has done this previously, but gotten away with it because no one has taken action. 

Any help / advice would be greatly appreciated. I am just not sure what to do as it should be a UK law dispute, and I know next to nothing about UK law or any of their practices. 

Thanks. 

Edit: I did post this earlier, but I think it got lost in the abyss. / I'm sure no one from the UK was online.

I've been reading through UKPF and have used a lot of your advice. First, thank you for that!
I am about to start up a S&amp;S ISA for the first time and would like to ask a few questions before I do. My situation is below:

* 0) 25 years old
* 1) No debts
* 2) I have £18,000 in a fixed-term cash ISA (primary) which will be kept and earmarked for emergency funds if needed (Allowed a number of instant withdrawals)
* 3) Another £8,500 in a cash ISA (secondary) with a low interest rate
* 4) Around £15,000 in a recently matured savings account
* 5) I am budgeting around £500 per month savings in the future.
* 6) I set up an iWeb account on the final day before it went up from £25 -&gt; £200 set up. That was just luck on my part - I was researching stocks and shares that day, decided that iWeb looked like a good idea, saw that they were changing the price drastically and signed up!
* 7) Already maxed my ISA for this year just gone

What I'm looking for:

* 1) Making a decent return (what else!)
* 2) At the moment, I don't want to create my own strategy/manage anything closely, until I am more confident with what that would involve. I imagine that would be trackers? (I'm not entirely sure what the definition of a tracker is?)
* 3) Invest most of my money long term 10+ years. I will add in the caveat that while I'm not planning to buy a house in the next 5 years, this could very feasibly change and so there is a low but possible chance I may need a good chunk for a deposit in 3+ years.

What I'm planning to do:

* 1) Transfer the £15000 from the savings account into the Stocks and Shares ISA, as well as the £8,500 from the secondary ISA.
* 2) I am looking into investing into the Vanguard LifeStrategy 100 (40% of my money).
* 3) Invest in another tracker similar to this, can I ask for recommendations? Something without much management, and a decent level of risk. (40% of my money)
* 4)  Vanguard LifeStrategy 40 (20% of money). Keeping some money in this in case I do need to pull out in the short-mid term. Is this a sensible strategy? This is not taken from any advice, so could be a very bad idea(?)
* 5) I'm not sure where to put the £500/month, now that I have maxed out next years allowance (the year after, I will put it into the S&amp;S ISA). Possibly another account with iWeb, and put into similar fund.

Questions:

* 1) Does this overall plan seem sensible?
* 2a) What is a tracker, exactly? b) Is it the same as a fund? c) And a mutual fund?
* 3) Similar tracker(?) to the Vanguard LifeStrategy 100? (https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2ckrrr/good_funds_to_invest_in/) has a few ideas:
*   VUKE -- Vanguard FTSE 100 tracker
*   MIDD -- iShares FTSE 250 tracker
*   VUSA or HSPX -- S&amp;P 500 trackers
*   SLXX -- Corporate bonds market
*   DJMC -- Exposure to Europe

* 4) When I enter Vanguard LifeStrategy 100 into https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/funds , it comes with two options. ""Acc NAV"" and ""inc NAV"". I cannot seem to find what the difference is between the two?
* 5) Whichever of the above from q.4 is correct, I assume that all I have to do is to buy shares in this fund? As simple as that?
* 6) I was looking at the help to buy ISA, which I think would be very beneficial if I was planning on buying a house several years down the line. The main downside I see is that it uses up my subscription for the year so I would not be able to start the S&amp;S ISA? Edit: further reading looks like it may just be that I cannot open a new cash ISA if I open this. So this might be a possible option - put money both into the S&amp;S isa £11600 as well as this help to buy ISA £1000+£200/month.

I like listening to the iplayer while doing my daytime job(packing boxes), for education and entertainment. 

I've enjoyed Bleak Expectations, Old Harry's Game, and the latest version of A Tale Of Two Cities(Favorite), along with Cabin Pressure(Not too fond of the writing, but the actors are good enough to deliver it well). 

Further, I'm listening to A History Of Ideas, but I'd love to listen to some more history-based programmes. My favorite period is the 19th century, although I do like to hear about all the other periods.

I currently work for a small telecoms company in the UK. This company has been around for a few years and is both successful and profitable.
I joined the team about two years ago as a project manager / provisioning manager. At the time there were around 6 staff. We have about trebled in size over the last 2 years, both in staff employment and financially. I have been offered the potential to become the operations manager for this company (a role which does not yet exist) so the MD can focus on strategic growth etc.

I feel my progression here is slower that it should be, I also feel learning is a constant process throughout life and I haven't much opportunity to do so here. Prior to this job I worked in the oil &amp; gas industry on cutting edge laser scanning and modeling software. I have a BSc in design engineering and am PRINCE2 qualified.

I am already a long time skincareaddiction junkie, so I know quite a lot about what to expect. I know it's going to dry her out and she should start slow and that she should expect it to get worse before it gets better etc. However, I'm stumped on a recommendation for sunscreen. I just import Japanese sunscreen usually for myself, but she's younger so she can't buy online, and probably wants something affordable and accessible. 

Any recommendations for a sunscreen I can find in boots, superdrug or a supermarket like asda would be really appreciated.

I wanted to get a feel for how much time postgraduate students (particularly in biological sciences) spend on campus. My boyfriend will be there, too, and he'll be a huge help, but should I expect to spend 10-12 hours on campus every day, or will I be able to do a lot of studying from home?

The alternative is leaving her with my mother in the US for two years. I love my dog so much, and I really want to find a way around being without her for that long.

I'm a San Francisco 49ers fan, who recently stumbled upon [an interesting thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/2zgicq/a_uk_fans_perspective_on_everything/) This thread has sparked some interest in the world of football, and it seemed like a good chance to find out some more about this team/sport. 

I don't have much knowledge about the sport/league/positions/etc, so I was wondering if this fine sub could help a beginner out. An ELI5 would be amazing. 

Some questions I'm curious about:  
-Who is our greatest rival now/all time?  
-Who is our best player?  
-What's our position of biggest need?  
-Any good highlight videos out there I should watch?  
What is our league? English league? Do leagues send top teams to the world cup?   
-Is there any common sayings/songs/chants I should learn as a Southampton fan?   
-When professing my allegiance, is there a shorter way to abbreviate Southampton? SAFC? Saintsfc?   
-When buying a jersey do you just buy a plain team jersey with no name? Or do you buy your favorite players jersey and live in fear of them leaving at some point?   
-Any good videos out there to help me get a better understanding of the sport/a bit of history/etc?

Hopefully this doesn't get taken in a negative way. I am a football noob, but really do wanna get into the sport more! I found a perfect team to bridge my way into the sport.

Cash ISAs are looking pretty pathetic in terms of interest currently but is it worth keeping one going to keep the tax free on up to £15k? 

Any current accounts worth dripfeeding to keep higher interest?

I love him as a player and, considering he's already 25, if he were to stay with us into the championship he may never reach his full potential, he has the opportunity to go into a top half club with far better delivery then ours, hopefully he can then continue to score goals and make the national team. Additionally, the team has been too reliant on him this season, we need to rebuild and create a team capable of scoring goals without passing to a certain player and hoping for the best, Charlie's scored nearly half our goals which is far too much especially when we're playing two strikers. Finally, he won't go cheap and we'll make a decent profit on him which will help us rebuild the team, something I'm hoping whoever the new manager is will be keen to do.

I hate her, she had an affair with him before we separated (our relationship was close to being over anyway but that pushed it over the edge). They are in a long term relationship and say they want to get married and have children in the future. They have been together for around five years now.

Is there anything I can do to keep her away from my children? She had an affair with him, she must have no morals, I do not want my children around her.

In short, the new rules would state that:


&gt;- A player will have to have been registered with his club from the age of 15 - down from 18 - to qualify as 'home-grown'.
The minimum number of home-grown players in a club's first-team squad of 25 will increase from eight to 12, phased over four years from 2016.
- At least two home-grown players must also be 'club-trained' players - defined as any player, irrespective of nationality, that has been registered for three years at their club from the age of 15.
- Only the best non-EU foreign players will be granted permission to play in England.

If all of these rules come into effect, how would the club be affected?

I went straight to A&amp;E in a taxi because I knew it was broke.

Upon arriving I waited around, and was seen by a A&amp;E nuse on duty. She took a look at my hand, and called a specialist down. Whilst the nurse observed my hand she was unecasarily applying pressure to the area telling me to stop being a girl, and that she's seen worse. This wasn't a joke, my partner was with me and even she was shocked with the nurses tone.

The specialist arrived and said ""you need an operation"". I refused. When I had Cancer I had to have an operation. I was told I had breathing complications during my Cancer op, and the anasthetic messed me up. I opted to not have the operation. Personal choice.

I went away to wait in the waiting area, and the female nurse that seen me called me over, pulled me aside, and said ""So your refusing treatment. You do know your making  a huge mistake, have you told your girlfriend"".

I explained I wasn't refusing, but I couldnt have an operation. So I said again ""Can you cast it"". She said something under her breath and walked away giving me the ""whatever"" hand sign.

Everyone was acting like I was doing something bad.

I had the cast, but the doctor doing it was also unprofessional. He was acting as id he didn't want to be doing it, and that I'd made him do something he didn't want. He done it wrong too, because a week later I had to have it recasted. She even said ""Whoever done this has done it completely wrong, this needs redoing today"".

From my observation, and from reading other things online, it seems that nurses and doctors would rather push you into an op because it's convenient for them to push you off onto another ward. When I went back a week later, the hand specialist said a cast will be fine but it may heal a little odd BUT I will have full range of movement (as I did even when it was broken).

So why was I being forced into an op, and treated like idiot when I opted for alternative treatment? I'm a bit confused.

**I took it to a local garage who tested the alternator and battery for free. Apparently the battery was charging, but was the original 2007 Honda battery so the charge it could hold was very very small. Having flooded the bike and been a berk with the choke on Monday, I drained the little bit of charge the battery did have and got myself in a right pickle. The garage filled, charged and fitted a new battery in a matter of hours and I was back on the road by the afternoon.**

Strolled out of work last night to find my 2007 CBF600 was having trouble starting. After three or four cranks I came to the conclusion I had flooded the engine so, ignition off, left it for 5 minutes, and tried again. 

To my horror, the starter decided to slowly fade away and die on me. No bike start, no turnover, nothing except a nasty clicking from my battery compartment. 

Managed to bump it and ride it home where I turned the bike off and tried to start it again. Nothing - same nasty clicking. Took the battery out and put it on charge for an hour, connected her back up - huzzah! Instant start! 

Today will be a troubleshooting day - I need to go and get myself a multimeter so I can check for any leak between negative battery and negative bike. Concerning that the bike isn't charging the battery when it's on - but is it meant to do that on a bike? When the bike is running and idling in neutral if I twist the throttle and look at the lights, they do get slightly brighter the more revs I put on. I'm led to believe this means the alternator is doing its job, but taking some readings with a multimeter will hopefully prove a bit more useful. 

Might be worth mentioning at this point that this battery could be the original at 8 years old, as it has Honda stamps on it (but no date) and the previous owner didn't change it, with the owner before that only clocking up 2000 miles on it. 

This is the first time this has happened since taking ownership (just over a week ago) and I've been riding it fairly hard since then. 20 mile trips to work everyday and rideouts over the weekend just gone. The previous owner fully charged the battery and said it showed a ""very good"" condition on his Optimate.

I have recently started looking into options of how to help my father to become debt free.
Currently he is repaying 2 credit cards, 3 loans, bank overdraft and some other debts which all add up to just a little bit over 20 000 £

He is repaying around 1000 £ in debts each month, which he is able to keep up as long as he is working, however, due to the nature of his work and his position, he tends to run out of work once in a while which results in a prolonged (1-2 months) unemployment which then results in him having to get another huge loan.
He has no savings, just a bunch of debt, so I was wondering if IVA or Bankruptcy is a viable option?
I don't know the ins and outs of IVA's and Bankruptcies, only that they damage your credit score very badly, so I hope someone can shed some light for me

Since Jordan Ibe came back from loan he's been outstanding.  Personally, I'd like him on the wing but Markovic is also a good selection.  Should the team dabble in the summer transfer window for a new full-back or stick with one of our own?   

**Concerning Jordan Ibe**: I happen to think he has just as much, if not more potential than Sterling.  He's extremely confident on the ball, very composed and fits right in with the style of play we employ.  Your thoughts?  

**Suggestions**: Nathaniel Clyne, Coleman (unlikely), Sciglio, Montoya 

2) **Where's our Matic, Schneiderlin, Matuidi, Busquets etc.?**:  Despite Joe Allen being in decent form these last couple of weeks, I think Rodgers should consider making a move for a defensive midfielder this summer.  Lucas (when he's healthy) has shown to be very good when called into the starting XI but he's out (injury) way too often.  Can is extremely versatile/reliable and I would have no problem with him pairing up with Henderson in midfield.  What do you guys think?   

**Suggestions**: Alex Song (once he's back at Barca), Gonalons, Sven Bender, Leroy fer

3)**Now for the Forwards**:

**Sturridge**: Fantastic player.  At the moment I think he's still a bit rusty but I'm sure he'll be fine.  On the down side, he can be a little greedy at times and may take an extra touch in the box instead of taking the shot.  His recent string of injuries also has me worried.  Hopefully what happened at the beginning of the season doesn't become the norm.  He's top class in my eyes; just look at that goal on De Gea this weekend. 

**Lambert**: I like the guy.  I really wanted him to do well but it hasn't really panned out.  I don't know what else to say.

**Balotelli**: I really believe the supporters are warming up to this guy.  Maybe in the beginning he was a bit sluggish but now it seems as though he's enthusiastic about playing for the team.  He may not get as many minutes as I would like but for the past couple of weeks I've had no complaints.  He has yet to show us his best and I hope he does while wearing the red shirt.

**Borini**: To be honest, i feel bad for him.  If he would have left for Sunderland earlier in the year he might be playing full minutes and perhaps Sunderland wouldn't be in a relegation battle.  I would much rather see him playing for another club so he can play the game.

**Origi**: I haven't been keeping up on his progress at Lille.  Does anyone have any information?

The thing is, is this really the case? There's a lot of people, expert, important, significant people who don't seem to agree with this view. The IMF, the Financial Times, and the Economist - they all take the view that deficit isn't the most imporant thing to deal with right now.

Add to that the fact that the maths behind austerity were substantially discredited when the main paper on this was found to have an excel coding error.

I enjoyed the new Whig party's description of the deficit focus: ""The condescending analogy often given is that the Government needs to pay down the deficit as if it were a household credit card. The analogy only works if the credit card holder were immortal, the world’s sixth richest entity, and the card had a 0.5% APR. A more accurate analogy would be a householder who has arbitrarily decided to pay off his mortgage within five years, and has stopped feeding his children to do so.""
