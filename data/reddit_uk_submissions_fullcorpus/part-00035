While watching ""The Last Dragonlord"" episode of Merlin today, it dawned on me what the series is missing, and why even though I watch it, I find it lacking. 

Earlier today, I had been listening to Melvyn Bragg's ""In our time"" discussion about the advent of the scientific method. Academia turned inside out in the 1600s... with the innovation of the use of hypotheses and experimentation substituting for the exercise of logic built on first premises.

Unfortunately, commonly we tend to think that before Francis Bacon, and the advent of modern science, our society had only superstition. This is exactly the surreal world that the authors of the Merlin series portray. I think that for the series to be inspiring to me, it would have to more accurately reflect Middle Ages society.

So often, in ""Merlin"" episodes, you see the conflation of scientific experimentation and magic. It's both scary, and also intriguing to the characters. It has what they need, but it also has this bewitching power over them. The reason experimentation was looked down upon during the era of the ""alchemists"" is because it was known to be the trade of charlatans. Real academics of the day did experiments to check whether their hypotheses could predict things... but they didn't build further beyond that. In their mind, the real meat of learnedness had to do with the line of logic behind their reasoning. 

Of course, there were occasional ""witch trials"" and the odd bit of superstition, here and there - but this was the exception rather than the rule during the Middle Ages. Right thinking ordinary members of the public wouldn't have thought that way.",false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,null,null,self,What I think the Merlin series needs,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/BritishTV/comments/p5p2e/what_i_think_the_merlin_series_needs/

With that out of the way, here's a few thoughts that have been circulating in my mind:

1. **Torres is not the Torres we thought when we bought him.**

    Something's bothering him and it just doesn't go away. He's now more of an attacking midfielder than a striker. He drifts back to the midfield and into the wings but as soon as he gets anywhere near the box, alarm bells start ringing in his head and he looks to pass rather than shoot. 

    Can we draft a letter/petition telling him we want to see him shoot no matter how many times he misses? He can't possibly miss all the time, can he? Not joking - maybe he seriously needs to hear it from someone. Let's put him up on a pedestal and treat him like god. Let's ignore all his (current) flaws and be utterly sycophantic about it/him. 

    Worth a try, if you ask me.

2. **AVB does not have (much of) a budget this year.**

    Roman spent about 30mn quid releasing AVB from Porto and that is the biggest transfer we were going to see this year. Add that to the signings of Mata, Cahill, Meireles, Romeu &amp; de Bruyne and we might have even declared a profit this year. Clearly, the FFP IS weighing heavily on AVB's &amp; RA's mind. The 67 mn loss isn't much when you compare it with the 199 mn loss that City declared earlier. Also, as someone pointed out in another thread, it is a drop in the ocean for RA.

    Either AVB took responsibility and said, ""Look, I'm not gonna buy indiscriminately and increase the losses further,"" or RA simply said, ""Remember the FFP. Work accordingly."" Maybe, this is AVB telling the other clubs, """"Nah-huh. We aren't falling for THAT again.""

    Crazy ideas, but worth thinking about.

3. **We have the spine of the club for the years to come.**

    Courtouis &amp; Delac
    Cahill &amp; Luiz (followed by Hutchinson, Bruma, Kalas &amp; Chalobah)
    Bertrand, PVA &amp; (maybe) Todd Kane
    Ramires, Romeu &amp; McEachran.
    Mata, Kakuta, de Bruyne &amp; Lalkovic
    Torres, Sturry, Lukaku, Piazon &amp; Davila. Also, Bamford.

    Indiscriminate signings are only going to disturb the balance further. Plus, it is no secret that we have a dressing room full of (well-earned) egos. It doesn't help that AVB is trying to teach the old dogs a few new tricks.

4. **Luiz is a future captain, mark my words.**

    He wears his heart on his sleeve but he also plays his heart out each time. He doesn't make forward runs because he is rash - he makes them because our midfield isn't doing it enough. He makes them to goad/shame the midfield into doing their jobs. It is almost as if he were saying to them, ""This is how it should be done, guys! Now get off your asses &amp; high-horses and do it.""

5. **The ""AVB is forcing them to play in fixed positions"" theory is bullshit.**

    Take a look at the positions of Torres &amp; Luiz as against those of Danny Graham &amp; Caulker. Note the difference in the positions and the relative distances between them. What do you see?

    I see that we don't have an out-and-out forward (even when we are supposed to have THREE. I guess that's why Drogba is scoring at the moment, IMO. He's always up there, in the box, causing defenders to panic. I see that our midfield is empty/spread thin. I see that we're fucked without Ramires &amp; Lamps because they fucking stay in the middle and don't drift out wide. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I didn't choose to follow Chelsea for the trophies - yes, they were a pleasant bonus but they weren't the reason. I followed Chelsea because I loved watching Zola play. I loved watching Flo &amp; Hasselbaink run the defense into disarray. I loved watching Sheva score. (Okay, the last was a joke.)

Yeah, it hurts because that elusive CL trophy has always been 'just that little bit out of reach' but I'm sure it hurts Lamps, Terry, Cole &amp; Drogba more than it hurts me. Maybe, that's the reason for all the aggression we've been seeing on the pitch, of late.

All I want to see is a team with spirit, a team with passion and a team with camaraderie. If they can win trophies along the way, good. If not, well, there's always the promise of a beautiful game I can rely on.

    Also we have had 31 Yellows and 4 Reds, United have only had 29 Yellows and a single Red card.

So anyway, yeah, as a city fan I know this is just a stumble, everyone stumbles. We're doing much better than last season and we should be proud, and we should get behind our players and our crazy manager and not stop this train until we hit the barrier at full speed!

Am I worried? Nope. We're doing a fifth better than last season! We've only lost 3 prem games so far. THREE GAMES! We're 60% through the season and have only lost THREE premier league games.

I decided not to rent any discs and just stream instead. Turns out, it will auto fill your rental lists with at least two films no matter how many times you remove them. Was about to try and cancel the account when I found out you could drag the open cd slots between lists. So I created a new list and simply dragged the cd slots into the empty list. No movies will be sent to my house and I can cancel at any time. (I hope)

What if Torres is a closeted homosexual and that is what is causing him to play so miserably?

My theory derives from reading [this article about Gareth Thomas](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1168953/index.htm) and his struggle with his own sexuality. 

Like Torres, Thomas was quietly married, though without children (but not for lack of trying). He was doing everything he could to keep his lifestyle hidden and to appear to be one of the manly men in Rugby and it caused him great personal anguish, which translated to his performance on the field.

Given the bigoted culture surrounding football (the main headlines lately have been about racism – Terry and Suarez – which is far less prevalent than anti-gay sentiment) wouldn't it make sense that a gay footballer would do everything in his power not to be publicly gay? 

Obviously none of us can answer this question definitively, but I wanted to share my thoughts and hear what r/chelseafc thought as well.

So I decided to compile a list of why Time Lord society must exist billions of years in our past. If I missed anything or something contradicts what I've said please tell me.

We know that time travel was gained when Omega destroyed one of the last population III stars. This was not mentioned on screen, but in other media. Going by what astronomers meant by pop III stars in 70's/80's, the last pop III stars died out about 9-10 billion years ago. This already shows that Time Lord society is ancient.

It's still possible that they could just last a really really long time, but there are a few on screen comments that disprove this. First, the Colin Baker said in Trial of a Time Lord that the Time Lords have had ""absolute power for 10 million years."" There is no reason to infer absolute power == time travel.

Patrick Troughton said that barring accidents Time Lords could life forever in The War Games. In off screen media, however, it was said that one Time Lord even lived for 7000 years implying that even if they could life for forever, they probably don't live more than a few 1000 years normally.

We know Tom Baker became the 407th Lord President. Also, Peter Davison became the 409th Lord President (even though neither actually did anything as Lord President). We know from various on screen and off screen media that there were at least 5-10 presidents between Peter Davison and the Time War.

Using the various numbers I gave, it is clear that the Doctor's ""present time"" is billions of years in our past. This is relevant because it seems like there is some way such that Time Lords always meet each other in the ""correct order"" since the Doctor and the Master always interact linearly, and same with the Doctor and Gallifrey.

Also, when Colin Baker referred to absolute power, he must have been referring to a time before they had time travel as well because 10 million years and 400something presidents gives a term of over 20,000 years, which is not only illogical, but contradicts what Patrick Troughton implied.

**Edit:** One thing I forgot, we also know there was less than 400 years between Peter Davison and the Time War. We know William Hartnell was at least 500 and we know Matt Smith was 900something, so there were 5-10+Presidents in less than 400 years.

**TLDR;** I was bored so I explained why the Doctor's present time is billions of years ago.

One that always sticks with me is the death of Lynda in Series 1 (2005). She was beginning to grow as a character and had accepted the Doctor's invite to travel with him. The part that really sticks with me though is how it happens. The Daleks (before they became somewhat of a laughing stock and, to me at least, were still very intimidating) blow her into the vacuum of space. But the really chilling part is the silence of the moment, the fact that you can't hear the Daleks say ""Exterminate"" but you can see it is very chilling to me.

He doesn't shoot much, he looks dejected, and he gets a ton of abuse. We're starting to become a sizable community, and maybe as a united voice we can do something positive.

My initial idea is that there's currently some sort of #asktorres campaign going on on Twitter. As you may know, we have an r/chelseafc Twitter account, thanks to lachiendupape (see sidebar) and I'm pretty sure there's quite a few of us on Twitter. Maybe we tweet/retweet the same positive message using the hashtag (#asktorres) and including @chelseafc. Looking for feedback here guys, let me hear your voice!

Second edit: wizzi's suggestion of asking Torres ""What single thing from the supporters gives you the most inspiration?"" is one that I really like.

Had Spurs' keeper had a slightly worse game they'd've scored 4 or 5, he was phenomenal. Think Ruddy when Norwich came to Anfield and you get the idea.

Sterling was superb, Suso was class and you could tell Flanagan had played first team football.

Unfortunately, we should have won. Michael N'Goo missed 2 gilt-edged chances. However, he did create a few more by powering repeatedly through a rather fragile Tottenham back line.

We'll come back next season stronger and better equipped for this tournament.

Leave your family, friends, colleagues for being unemployed, because shame on you for being temporarily unable to pay your rent. You're taking taxpayers money, even if it probably is money you've been paying all your life.

Actually long term unemployment for 2008 was 1.4% (incredibly low). If you factor in people who seriously can't work because of disability, and according to the Office for Disabilities, ""There are over ten million people with a limiting long term illness, impairment or disability in Great Britain"", then hardly anyone is really cheating the system, especially in terms of households. 

So why do we take from those who need it the most? Yet here we are in 2011, taking money off people just as unemployment hits record highs. So what is the state telling us? We'll help you, but only when a few people want help? Shame on people who game the system, but according to this very little do.

This is my rendition of a genie in a bottle.

If I was to ever come upon a lamp and out came a genie, I would be shocked.  He has offered me three wishes and when he said that, thousands of ideas for wishes came to mind.  What to wish for, money, happiness, family, power, land? The possibilities were endless.  Then out of no where, I knew what I wanted for my first wish.  My very own TARDIS or Time and Relative Dimension in Space.  This is a machine used by the Doctor in a television show, Doctor Who and can travel anywhere in space and time.  The adventure I could have in this machine would be infinitesimal.  I would travel to different galaxies or maybe to the beginning of the universe just to see how it happened. 
	
My next wish would be to become a Time Lord.  A Time Lord is race of people that lived billions of years ago.  This is another reference from the show Doctor Who.  The Doctor himself is the last Time Lord alive after the great Time War killed every Time Lord except for himself.  A Time Lord can live for thousands of years and is very hard to kill.  Their bodies can take a much greater pounding from what the universe has to offer such as radiation, gamma rays and x-rays.  Also if a Time Lord is killed, they can regenerate themselves into a whole new body, healed of all wounds.  Being a Time Lord would be ideal for traveling though time and space, not knowing the dangers of the universe.
	
In all aspects, this would be the ultimate two wishes for me and I would have saved my last wish for a future time but what kind of time traveler travels without a weapon.  My weapon of choice would be a sonic screwdriver.  This “weapon” comes hand in hand with the Doctor.  It doesn’t harm anyone and can open up any door except wooden or deadlocked doors.  The sonic screwdriver can also scan areas for life, do body scans on people to check for injurers and fits handily in any pocket so it can be easily concealed.  Having something like this out in the universe would be ideal for adventures because then no door is locked and you can adventure easier.

The receivers still send me quarterly reports on how it's dividing up.

This one thing today pissed me off: pretty much no one is getting paid - staff, contractors etc.

But the principle creditor, a company owed 2.7 million has just been paid 3.1 million from sales of property etc.

The extra money comes from *interest* owed to the company.

Surely given that the company is in receivership they can't be expected to get interest from their assets?

And that interest also could have paid all the staff who didn't get their wages etc. (and little old me!).

Not only that, the receivers charge an exorbitant amount of money to actually processes the whole thing - I mean it's a licence to print money.

The end result is, basically, that the community wants everything to be allowed.  The only exceptions to that are Chat Logs (Omegle, Cleverbot, Facebook, etc.) and things which have no relation to Doctor Who except via the title.  Obviously this is a little subjective, so if ever a post is removed that you feel should have been allowed - just message us and explain why.

So I finally got around to watching some of the classic series and I managed to see every single Doctor in at least one story. I ended up watching the following:

- First Doctor: The Unearthly Child, The Daleks, and Edge of Destruction

- Second Doctor: The War Games

- Third Doctor: The Three Doctors

- Fourth Doctor: Genesis of the Daleks

- Fifth Doctor: Earthshock 

- Sixth Doctor: Vengeance on Varos

- Seventh Doctor: Remembrance of the Daleks

- Eight Doctor: Doctor Who (1996)

- Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh: EVERYTHING (including the animated movies for 10)

So here's the breakdown: I know you've heard it before but the classic series isn't very much like the new series. Sure there's the Doctor, some companions, the TARDIS and a whole lot of running, but everything moves so much slower and the Doctor isn't always the zany fun-loving guy you've come to love. With that in mind, here's a handy guide for other people looking to get into the classic series (but don't want to get bogged down by 26 years of occasionally-awful stories).

The First Doctor - He's rude. And also vaguely incompetent. This is about as far as the Doctor as you know him as you can get. As far as the pilot episode goes, it's actually fairly entertaining. It's the story that gets spun out of that pilot that's truly annoying. It's exceptionally boring and slow. Not to mention the fact that Susan (his ""granddaughter"") seems like she should be an awesome companion on paper (a young timelord eager to see the universe) is actually the most annoyingly whiny person on the show. I'd recommend watching the pilot, skipping the rest of the first story and The Daleks (trust me, there's like 10 parts and they all manage to be sleep-inducingly slow), and picking up on the odd two-parter Edge of Destruction (it's cool scifi that doesn't actually make too much sense but manages to be fun to watch).

The Second Doctor - He's a big departure from the first doc. He's odd and plays the recorder at random times. AND he cares about his companions (which include some kind of baby-faced future girl and a 17th century highlander complete with kilt). Still, his hair is endlessly distracting. 

The Third Doctor - He's a bit conventional and boring. Honestly, during this era of the show, the Brigadier is probably the best character. I really can't think of any defining characteristics for this Doctor. But The Three Doctors is actually somewhat entertaining.

The Fourth Doctor - Here's the icon you've heard so much about. Finally, this is a Doctor worth writing home about. He's weird (seriously? a 14 foot long scarf and some weird afro?), he's funny, and he's brilliant. He doesn't seem too concerned about the safety of his companions though (he pretty much leaves Sarah Jane for dead in the first ten minutes of the story). I'll definitely be going back to check out more of his adventures. Genesis of the Daleks is a must-watch.

The Fifth Doctor - That mini-episode he had with Tennant may have given you the impression that Five is a dynamic and exciting guy. Well... not so much. He's definitely the most human Doctor. He treats his companions like family (and serves as sort of a father-figure to Adric... who sucks). But then, a lot of things in this era seem iffy. The cybermen have personalities. That's weird. Anyway, Five is intriguing enough to warrant a second look but Earthshock has almost no merit unless you care about the companions.

The Sixth Doctor - Six is often maligned as the worst Doctor. From what I saw, that's total crap. While he's certainly not the best, he's far from the worst. Six is easily angered but he's also still brilliant and much more Doctor-like than Five and Three seemed to be. He's pretty melodramatic but he gets stuff done and is fairly entertaining to watch (even if the stories he's given to work with aren't). I'd recommend watching almost any story he has in which Peri is the companion. Because, simply put, Peri is bangin'. Completely useless, but still... bangin'.

The Seventh Doctor - Seven is weird. And I don't mean ""he's kooky!"" I mean he's somewhat distant and calculating. He manipulates people into doing what he wants and sees no problem with this as he seems to view humanity as inferior and kind of dumb. Not in a malicious way, but more of ""oh, this is what I have to deal with to save the universe? better than nothing."" Ace, his companion, is very strange. It's like watching the female version of John Connor in T2: a bunch of rebellious teen angst stuffed into a cliched character with a leather jacket and a pony tail. And she carries around a bat and a boom box. And she calls the Doctor ""Professor."" It gets grating. Seven is worth a watch though.

The Eighth Doctor - The 1996 movie is crap. Pure and simple. You remember how I said Five was the most human Doctor? I lied. It's Eight. Literally. He claims to be half human. Which isn't even the worst aspect of the altogether ridiculous plot. I imagine he might've been interesting if he'd been given more to work with but... well, he's just a whiny guy with an accent who wanders around begging complete strangers to help him and they're like ""wtf, no..."" I really can't recommend the movie.

Does anyone know how to go about getting one of those memorial benches? I couldnt find any links or info online for Edinburgh, is this a council run thing? 

We looked at maybe doing something in the botanics, but they're options are a little beyond what we can afford right now, its costs £5000 to ""adopt a tree"" which gets you a small sign beside the tree of your choice and between £1000 - £5000 for a small sign on their ""hope tree"" sculpture.     

Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas?

**tl;dr** I need to have a British accent for a speech I will be giving as the Doctor, and need help learning how to do the accent properly.

I belong to a [community service organization](http://gocarainbow.org/1rainbow.htm) and this year I'm serving as California's state Musician and Representative to New Jersey and New York. At our state convention, each representative gives a speech about her jurisdictions; what they're doing this year and how they differ from California. Each speech is also done in character, as someone representing their states. So for example the rep to Idaho could be an Idaho potato, or the rep to Indiana could be an INDY racecar driver, etc. This year I'm in the odd position of having been my own successor to my office. It very rarely happens, but last year I held this same office. So how do I give essentially the same speech twice?? TIME TRAVEL. So I'm going to be the Doctor for my speech, and poke a bit of fun at the fact that I'm doing the same thing again.

Here's where I need your help. My British accent is....well not very British sounding at all. For a large group of Californians it's passable, but if I am going to play the Doctor, I want to do it right by the Doctor and learn the accent properly. What would help me immensely is if someone from Britian could record themselves saying the speech and send it to me. **You would be my friend forever, and I would upvote all your posts.**

Its a serious question because for the life of me, I cannot figure out why I like British TV better than American TV.

I like watching TV shows. That is a fact everybody knows. I am an Indian and Indian Television sucks. Its the same story repeated in every show. I started loving watching TV shows a few years back when my mind had a very personal big bang due to the internet. I got exposed to the really great shows, all of them were American. Started with Numb3rs then friends then how I met your mother and the list goes on. In November 2011 I discovered Sherlock. I used to love the books (still do) as a child. I have read almost everything and watched everything related to Sherlock Holmes. So I thought it was my duty to watch this too. I was bloody floored. This was so awesome. Then I started watching other British TV shows (which I got from the list of shows broadcasted on BBC One). I was hooked. 

Now I am sure I love British TV more than American one. But I can't pinpoint why. I am not the kind of person who is into analyzing the shows he watches. I don't really go around and read a lot about art of TV show making. But I just need to know why I love British TV more than the American one. Here are some ballpark guesses.

1. **British TV has balls:** Although they may not have that much of offensive language as American TV has, they have the balls to show things as they really are. They do not sugarcoat stuff. Like last night I was watching an Episode of Hustle. Its about con men, but the good type. You know...the type which rips off only rich people who are not honest. The line ""You cannot con a honest person"" is repeated many times throughout the show. But in Season 1 Episode 5 they accidentally destroy a honest man's life. If it were American TV (like their show Leverage), in the last 5 minutes they would have solved the problem and the honest man would have been saved. But that is not how it works. Once a con is setup and in the finale you cannot revert the consequences (at least not in the con which they ran). They had the balls show it exactly like that. 

2. **British culture resonates with me:** Although I am now very familiar with the American culture, Europe is more closely related to India in terms of culture. For example, Americans are fanatics about their religious preferences. They practically define themselves using that. That shows in most of the US comedies where fun is made using the religious stereotypes. But this is not true for British TV. They focus more on the character's individual traits rather than the stereotype. I really like that.

3. **Its just fresh, it will ware off:** Maybe I am just bored of watching the same kind of shit and this is fresh. Maybe it will just pass over and I would start to see both on the same level.

4. **Its not about love stories:** I like a romantic angle as much as the next guy, but you don't have to put one in every freaking thing. US TV does that way too often. All the British TV I have watched has been conservative about these things. There may be hint to romantic angles but it never becomes the focus of a whole episode.

On a snowy afternoon at the Etihad stadium, Manchester City looked to add a 12th win to their so far perfect home record in the premier league, whilst Fulham hoped to capitalise on a shaky run of recent form from the blues, who had won only 2 of the last 6 games prior to kickoff. The previous meeting at Craven Cottage saw Fulham overturn a 2-0 deficit to claim a point, both City goals in that game came from Sergio Aguero.


In the continued absence of Yaya Toure, City lined up with Gareth Barry as the only holding midfielder, Adam Johnson and Aleks Kolarov came into the starting line up in an attempt to add some width. Aguero and Dzeko both started with Mario Balotelli serving the third match of his 4 game suspension. Vincent Kompany was left out of the side due to injury and was replaced by Stefan Savic to play alongside Lescott.



Following Bobby Zamora's deadline day transfer to QPR, top scorer Clint Dempsey started as the lone striker with Moussa Dembele just behind him. Chris Baird came in at left back in place of summer signing John Arne Riise with ex-City midfielder Dickson Etuhu starting in the centre.



A very one sided first half saw City take control of the game and it was almost a case of attack versus defence for most of the first 45. The citizens put pressure on the away side early on with Gareth Barry finding Dzeko in the box who's first time effort flew harmlessly over the bar under pressure from Hangeland (5 mins). City's early dominance was rewarded on 10 minutes after good work from Aguero on the wing saw the striker find Adam Johnson on the edge of the box who skipped through the Fulham defence and was brought down by Chris Baird leaving Referee Mike Dean with no option but to point to the spot, although replays showed Johnson went down rather softly. Aguero stepped up to take the spot kick and his powerful drive beat Mark Schwarzer to give the blues a deserved lead.



City dictated the pace of the play following the goal but a glimpse at goal for Fulham saw Davies fire a low shot straight at Joe Hart (23). A half chance then fell for Damien Duff but good pressure from Lescott closed off the angle and Duff's shot bounced wide (29). Moments later a City break saw Nasri play Aleks Kolarov down the wing who played a trademark cross behind the Fulham defence, a flick on from Aguero found Johnson at the back post who's shot took a wicked deflection off Chris Baird and flew past a helpless Mark Schwarzer (30). Claims for a second City penalty were waved away by Mike Dean after David Silva was hacked down from behind by Etuhu (31).



City continued to pile on the pressure with a battling run from Micah Richards nearly finding Silva in the centre only for a good clearance from Phillipe Senderos to deny the Spaniard (34). Sergio Aguero could have put the hosts further in front on 37 minutes when Johnson released Dzeko down the right and the Bosnian international worked the ball into the box only for Aguero to fire a shot straight at Schwarzer from 12 yards. Just a minute later Dzeko nearly added a third himself when another good run lead to a shot being blocked excellently by Brede Hangeland (38).



The snow fell even more heavily at the start of the first half as Fulham pushed higher up the pitch in an attempt to reclaim something from the game. Fulham's early pressure was well dealt with by City and there were few chances for either side early on. City introduced Milner in place of Nasri on 53. The ground staff had to be called onto the field to clear snow five minutes later and fears of an abandonment  arose.



The game was allowed to continue and the first real chance of the second period fell to Fulham with Stephen Kelly firing a low shot at Hart (60). A clumsy challenge from Milner then gave Fulham a chance from 25 yards but Baird's freekick was no trouble for Hart (63). City responded immediately with some good work in the box and Schwarzer had to react quickly to Aguero's shot.



City then put the game beyond doubt after Adam Johnson sent Aguero down the wing and some lovely footwork from the Argentinian saw him skip though the Fulham defence and square to Dzeko who converted with a well placed finish from 10 yards (72). Moments later a foul by Kolarov angered Moussa Dembele and the pair were subsequently booked for the resulting confrontation. A deflected Fulham corner then nearly gave the away side hope as it was turned onto the post by Dzeko (78).



Fulham introduced Bryan Ruiz and John Arne Riise to try and inject some attacking flair into the game while Nigel De Jong replaced Sergio Aguero on 80 minutes and the striker left the field to some well deserved applause from the City fans. Riise had a late chance to restore some pride for the cottagers as a deflected pass found the full back in the box but his low shot was easily turned away by Hart. New loan signing David Pizzaro was awarded a brief cameo on 90 minutes coming on for Adam Johnson wearing the number 8 jersey, the former Chilean international was greeted by cheers from the home faithful. Pizarro was the architect of a late chance for City, finding Kolarov down the wing with an excellent ball who's surging run was shut out by the Fulham defence. 

City held on for a straightforward 3-0 win to put three points between themselves and rivals Manchester United before United's trip to Stamford Bridge on sunday.

Player ratings:

25. Joe Hart- 6- very little to do throughout but kept his concentration to deal with everything that came at him.

2. Micah Richards- 7- the captain for the day showed his usual strength in defence and was often an attacking threat down the right.

6. Joleon Lescott- 8- perfect positioning and great tackling kept Fulham at bay.

15. Stefan Savic- 6- much better from the young Montenegro international, looked more confident on the ball, good marking and even willingness to get forward on occasion

13. Aleksander Kolarov- 7- great going forwards, caused real trouble with his trademark crosses.

18. Gareth Barry- 6- good battling display but looked a bit hesitant at times going forwards.

19. Samir nasri- 8- moved the ball well and covered well in defence to allow Kolarov to get forward.

21. David Silva- 7- Passed and moved effectively, created a number of chances.

11. Adam Johnson- 7- created the first two goals with excellent movement and was a constant threat on the wing.

16. Sergio Aguero- 9- wreaked havoc on the Fulham defence, skillful and Clever movement, took the penalty very well and created the third goal superbly.

10. Edin Dzeko- 7- good running and passing, took his goal well and created chances for others throughout.

Substitutes:

7. James Milner- 6- took over Nasri's role well and strong tackling held the midfield together.

34. Nigel De Jong- 6- solid display in the last 10 minutes, ensured the clean sheet with good positioning and tackling.

8. David Pizarro- 6- no time to make a real impact but looked confident with every touch met by cheers from the home crowd on his debut.",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,Match Report: Manchester City V Fulham. 4th February 2012,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/paxhn/match_report_manchester_city_v_fulham_4th/

This is why I'd like to propose the subreddit branching out into two. /r/doctorwho would remain exactly the same, while /r/gallifrey would be specifically for posting news and discussion. Another redditor messaged the mods about it but they didn't reply, so I'm asking you, Whovians: is this something you'd want to happen? And if so, how do you feel about the name being r/gallifrey? An alternative may be r/dwdiscussion.

Also, I don't know much about creating stylesheets, so if someone else wants to take the helm that would be great.

He had season tickets through the 80's, went to the '85 Rapid Vienna game, and even made sure he kept an eye on the Everton score on the day I was born (Saturday March 26, 1988, we beat Watford 2-0, goals by Sharp and Sheedy; I was born at 4:50, right as the final whistle went!).

**NOTE**: This game could be postponed. Heavy snowfall in London. [WAGNH believe it's 50/50](http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2012/2/5/2771830/chelsea-vs-manchester-united-snow-postponement). I don't usually get up on gamedays until right before the game, so someone else will have to provide the confirmation as to whether the game will be played.

Manchester United need no introduction for this match. Rio Ferdinand, brother of Anton Ferdinand, who is center stage with John Terry in the racism scandel, is expected to start. David De Gea, under much scrutiny after plenty of poor performances, is expected to be between the sticks.

Chelsea lost the first match this season 3-1, after two offside goals from United, and despite controlling the majority of possession and attacking chances.

----
**Team news**:

Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou remain unavailable at the ACoN.

Terry (knee), Cole (red card), Mikel (hamstring), and Ramires (knee) will all miss out. Lampard (calf) could make his return. Gary Cahill is expected to get his debut.

Why doesn't this bar have any bouncers?  Cue group of clearly passionate Scottish fans who believed it was in their right to play ""catch with a rugby ball"" all night.  One had the audacity to drop their ball blindly behind him, as he knocked the drinks of other patrons - then refused to believe that his ball caused the mishap.  Complaints to the bar-staff go unheeded and the group are left feeling victorious as they bounce the night away.  

Now admittedly, the majority of the bar-staff were polite and very courteous except for one bartender who shall be named TTSB -*The Tattoo Sleeved Bartender*.  Not content at criticising people's drink choices, TTSB felt the need to advertise every time something irritated him; through-out the night.

One event stuck out: while making two drinks for other fellow diners, the customers mistook their cocktails as completed.  Alas this was bordering on high-treason in the eyes of TTSB who exclaimed he needed the drinks back to finish the drinks:  two peelings of orange zest, banging of the mixing cups while murmuring his 'annoyance'.

Overall, it's sad to see a locally 'acclaimed' bar to be let-down by certain factors, especially as during the night it was clear that the other members of staff were very enthusiastic but the fact is: you are as weak as your weakest chain.  

**edit** - on reflection, *worst night I've ever had* is all down to personal experiences, however what amazes me is how some people treat others when they believe they aren't being observed.

On r/soccer was never going to be the same, simply because it's too tribal, but imagine if we were able to say anything without fear of being pushed down by the sheer animosity of everyone else? 

This isn't about Liverpool being picked on, btw, because everyone does it to everyone else and I'm sure we give as good as we get, but it's about attempting to raise the levels of communication in r/soccer so that we can have a proper discussion without getting into enormous fights, and I don't know about you but I'd quite like to be able to talk to other teams' fans.

The only way I can see that happening is an end to the rampant downvoting, and the only way to do that is for us to stop first... if we do our part in attempting to make r/soccer habitable, will others follow?

I'm a German student, I've got to do a paper on tag questions of the UK for Uni, but all data is over 10 years old. This survey has two goals: 1. Is it possible to get good data this way? 2. Is it possible to get good data from Reddit?

If the data turns out to be good, I can use it and/or refine the survey. If not, I must change the method within my small means.

I think he's working for Spurs today, lads and lasses.

In any case, excellent result in my opinion.  Takes some (not all) of the pressure off the trip to Anfield - this way even if we lose we drop only a point each against United and Chelsea.  Obviously we want all three points, lest Arsenal and Liverpool gain ground, but at least Chelsea won't be breathing down our necks if we lose, the way they would have been with a win against United.

Beforehand we were next door in O'neills having a couple of drinks when a few of us decided we needed to go to the cash point. As we were walking along, in the really heavy snow, a young lady wrapped up in a sleeping bag asked if I had any change, I didn't, I would have offered to go and get her a coffee and some food or similar if I wasn't already pretty drunk and had thought of it at the time! Whilst I was about 10 foot away waiting for the cash point, a young guy walks past with a bag of food he'd wrapped up from a restaurant (I guess), stops and asks if she would like some food, and then hands her two large Subway type sandwiches, she is lost for words and stumbles a thank you and I almost shed a tear! He then goes on his journey with out a second thought, and has just made this ladys night, with something as simple as some food he was probably going to throw away anyway. 



Now I think of it, he could have had a bag full of sandwiches that he was handing out to the homeless, it did look pretty full, if that's the case then I wish I'd have shaken his hand or something.

I'll get straight into it, this is a bit of text that I wanted to share. I'm quite interested to how it will be received, so by all means post a comment expressing your opinion - whatever it is.

The subject is, how we in the UK inform ourselves of the news. So, names like BBC, Sky, Newspapers, Radio, Internet etc.

I had, and believe others have, an annoyance at news stations, particularly TV news stations. Sometimes I could tell a story was being stretched, glorified, emphasised or otherwise manipulated in its broadcast. I think we all know this to a degree even casual people who might not follow the news 'oh, they're just *saying* that' or what-have-you. 

However my annoyance took quite sharp turn as I started to become sort of a researcher. I would research different topics that quite often also came into the News Stations headlines. I'm probably going to need to use an example so I'll try and stick to just one. There are so many good examples to chose from, but I think the 'Occupy' movement (mostly occupy London) will suffice as it's quite current.

Following this example, imagine reading an in depth article on the occupy movement. This article went into details on what spurred the occupy movement, it talked about why people are protesting. It went into specifics where corporations where allowed to exploit the economy at the expense of the average Joe citizen. There'd be a section of all the different areas of inequality caused by the exploits and how so many people are effected etc etc. There'd be also some word of the protesters, in particular how their efforts are being received and to what degree of success. And as all decent news reports should do, there'd be a part on how this would effect us and the UK. 

Not as a researcher, or even a news reader, but as a member of the UK this hugely interested me as it hugely effects me. So I found it quite easy to look at some of the sources, some of the friction and political actions. Sister protests like UK-Cuts and even legislation proposals like Robin-Hood Tax. 

At the time many of my peers and family didn't happen to know much about any of this. So I was quite delighted when it appeared on the popular news stations. I was very keen for people knowing the efforts by protesters and the deep issues they're attempting to address. Unfortunately I was absolutely gutted and genuinely scared to instead find a report which light heartedly mocked the protesters as senseless nuisances with no agenda. The deep issues which are very real and very easy to prove - were light heartedly dismissed by the news reporters.

Debrief: This is just an example, there may be areas to specifically discuss this example further, which you're free to do. But I would appreciate you look at the system of news reporting rather than that specific example - and comment/discuss on this area instead. Also this example is really just one in a huge amount.

At this time, I observed people look up at the TV then go about their day. Sometimes I would hear 'did you hear about that occupy movement, did you see the news, they're all wearing comic book masks, haha' .... 'yeah I heard they're hurting the church' etc. Now I am a person who wants to encourage peoples own different beliefs than my own. And I like to think I respect others opinions. But I felt a huge pain in my side that ignorance was being and is being continuously generated by the media. 

Now there's two points I want to make here. The first is that one stations articles/reports will vary from another. One station may overlook an issue of manipulate it, while others will stick more to the facts. Different medias are more biased and some can be said to have their own agenda. In addition the UK have a far better news media than other countries. BBC articles tend to be some of the better less biased articles around in comparison to others. 

The other point is, almost the opposite. A vast majority of the news stations are all owned by the same people. What's worse than a monopoly in a market? ... A monopoly of information. I pray, take a few seconds to imagine the power and influence you would have owning the majority of news stations in the UK. I will make no harsh accusations - I will not name call. I'm sure you're all aware of the recent news corp situation. I need not say anymore on that point. In the last paragraph I paid the BBC a compliment. Though here I will say that by my own standards and that of the informations sources available on the internet - the BBC have exercised outrageous conduct, especially regarding the 'war on terror'. I will say no more, and note that if I am being vague it is so that you yourself may look into the matter without taking my word for it. And lastly and very importantly, even if a good ethic news company starts out with good intentions, they're bound to a system. Without assumptions I'll just state the facts and rules of the system and let you decide how successful they'd be. The government at any time can prevent certain matters entering the UK media. The existing media has a monopoly on the news and information, as we've seen with newscorp they easily conduct themselves above the law and are integrated deeply with corrupt police. Having such ties with the government (google relationship between the murdochs and previous prime ministers) having such resources and legals teams. Taking all that on board I'm sure you'll agree it would be abundantly hard for a news organisation with good ethics to establish itself and target a decent part of the viewers.

A word on corruption, since this is very controversial I will leave any specifics as subject to your own research. But I shall just say that a vast amount of money is exchanged between media giants and corporations, politicians, celebrities, organisations, public services and many  house hold names that you know. Most of this money is agreement of how news is reported regarding a vast amount of things to **us**. 

**The up-side**, now it's very easy to feel disheartened almost to the effect that you can't do anything about it. But, and I presume the sort of demo graphs that visit this sub reddit are already adept self informers. But.. for the benefit of the worried soul - fear not. The internet is home to any/everything you could chose to view. I will not push you in any one direction as I feel you're free to go on your own sites and find your own way, but I will suggest an interest in Wikileaks. Also I will depart with a tip, be careful of disinformation. The information revolution is in full swing and record amounts of people are now self-informing. I need only to gesture toward the African revolutions like Tunisia, Libya and Egypt which was spurred by people self informing (with thanks to some wikileaks) and then acting on the information. I propose only that instead of getting annoyed at the Media, we simply replace them - until they can responsibly report the truth.


My question is what do others think on this?


**TLDR** I feel that the media and news reporting comes with a huge ethical responsibility as many people base their opinions on what is reported. I feel that the system media is in, doesn't allow for that, I feel it's being exploited and I feel we're being manipulated. I want to know what you think - whoever you are and whatever you think.

Up to now I've been happy enough to focus on sorting out the squad. We've only just got Gerrard back so I wasn't exactly expecting any of the magic he has already displayed so far; the Suarez fiasco has obviously been a major hiccup and we all know how slow Carroll has been to find some form. Not to mention the King -- I mean, the man needed a chance to settle in. So all things considered, a couple of weeks ago I would have been happy to concentrate on the cups we're very much involved with and settle for a similar league result to last season.  
  
However, tonight is the first time in a long time that we've got almost a fully fit squad. Unless I'm forgetting anybody (and please forgive me if that is so), we're only missing Lucas Leiva. The return of Suarez alone would have been enough to get Anfield absolutely rocking tonight but we've also got the massive morale boost from defeating all of the Mancs in the same week -- all of these things should contribute to a continued improvement from Andy Carroll too.  
  
I'm sorry, but I can't get over how great this situation is. Normally at this stage in the season, United are a few points ahead of us with a game in hand and even though that's usually a battle for the top, it bores to hell out of me. This on the other hand, is probably one of the most exciting seasons I've had for a *long* time.
  
These days I tend to stress out over the matches against the bottom half of the table. When it comes to anybody above us though, I couldn't be more confident. As it stands, we only trail Chelsea by 5 points. A win over Tottingham tonight would nudge us ahead of the Arsenal and after that, we have the red shite *again*; this time in their yard -- even so, that's essentially in the bag, as far as I'm concerned (as long as that bald twat isn't in charge, of course). Then Everton; Arsenal; oh my days it's just beautiful. Not to mention, our penultimate game is against Chelsea no less, and it's **at home!!!**

BTW. That cat was a Spurs fan, didn't you see the cute furry little thing went out looking for Friedel? Come on you Spurs cats! Show your colours! He certainly wasn't a 'Pool fan, did you see him sporting a red shirt?

If there ever was a game where a cat *should* appear on the field, it would be the one where two birds play each other. LOL.

**Edit (pasted from comment below):**

God, Liverpool's way of playing disgusted me. Carroll and Suarez are proper ####s.

Carroll was diving the whole game in his pursuit of a penalty. He even launched himself into our players to fall down on the ground, then sprung up and yelled at the ref. One of the worst players I've ever seen. Disgusting.

Not to mention all the karate kicks we had to take. Parker got his stomach kicked, and Bale even got a big gash wound on his leg?

I feel like it's looking pretty bare and I don't really have many skills to offer even though I do have a science degree.

 In the last 5 weeks we play  fulham, newcastle, arsenal, qpr, liverpool, blackburn. 

Last season at this point we had 44pts and we finished 2nd taking 27/44 pts. I think that somewhere around 68 pts could secure 4th this season depending on who gets beat by who. Were looking at about 25 points from 14 games. So 9 wins, or 8 wins 1 draw, or 7 wins 4 draws, or 6 wins 7 draws. 

What do you guys think? How do you see this shaping up?

**tl;dr version of tl;dr**: Don't know what I want to do. Don't have qualifications. Can run Linux servers okay. Help me find a way of figuring out what direction to take?


**The tl;dr version**: I know a bunch of random stuff, can run servers, don't have any qualifications, disintegrated when doing the only job (not IT-related) I've had so far, and can't manage to get myself into work again (Keep getting turned down by recruiters who won't look at what I have done, because I don't have a degree), **nor do I know what I actually want to do**. All I really want to do is make things, doesn't matter whether it's software, hardware, or something between the two. CV is linked at the bottom for your amusement. 

## Start here!

I'm having a little trouble finding work for various reasons (Including ""I don't really know what I want to do"", which is rather an issue.), and I was hoping I could find some guidance (Or at least constructive insulting) here.

My only paid employment has been as a warehouse operative. I moved boxes for a month, I'd come off-shift with agonising joint pain and struggle to walk; but hey, it was a job. Then I stopped getting called in for shifts, without any warning, leaving me broke and unemployed again. I'm not sure I really want to do that again, and my advisor at the JobCentre is telling me I should really be looking at more skilled roles.

I took the warehousing job for two reasons:

1. I needed a job, and apparently running your own servers for 4+ years doesn't count as being able to administrate a system. (Also ""Oh, you don't have a degree? Um, sorry, then. *click*"") I don't have the fancy pieces of paper, and can't afford to get them until I get a job that also gives me enough time to take the training + exams.

2. The hours: late night, early morning. Despite my best efforts (It's going to take me a week, at least, to get back onto days), I constantly keep finding my internal clock at approximately UTC-8. (Which makes it rather difficult to get in sync with anyone working office hours, which are on GMT/BST.)


So, my skill-set in a (very large) nutshell:

* I can run Linux servers, UNIX (BSD, Solaris, etc) at a pinch given enough time to figure out the delta between it and what I'm already familiar with; hosting Email, WWW, IRC, Gopher, Jabber, etc. Have no experience with Windows Server, and only a little with Windows on a desktop; but not in any domain-type environment. (And really don't know it as well as I think I should to be able to deal with it for a job.)

* I can bash together code in various languages (Perl, C, Bash/KSH shell), and take an interest in a range of others (Forth, Lisp); worried that I can't code well enough to do it for a living (Despite me being told that it's at least understandable, runs and only needs a little more documenting.)

* A variety of utterly irrelevant rubbish that I find interesting, and would really like to actually *do* as part of my ideal job, but I'm not really any good at (And require actual qualifications, and money, that I don't have) so probably won't. Most of these involve a burning desire to just create something:
  - General metalwork, welding (Current project is a bike, so I can get around locally.)
  - Vehicle design (Especially oddball ones, or EVs, alternate fuel vehicles, etc. Anything as long as it's a challenge.)
  - Designing processors (Again, because I like creating things (Silly little impractical stack-machines, mostly.), and because processor design is neat!)


Now, for the 'bad' part: I only have high-school qualifications (GCSEs in all the core subjects, plus Engineering, IT, German, History), and two A/S levels (Chemistry, IT) from Sixth Form. Not an RHCE, or an MCSE, don't have an A+ (And (This is a common point) can't afford one without a job), nor a degree. I've taught myself, for the most part. This means it's hard for me to back up any of the skills or experience I have, especially to recruiters. I can point to my GitHub repos, the SVN logs, offer patch-files, etc. but I keep getting turned down because I don't have a degree, or commercial experience.

(Gee, and how would I get commercial experience? Oh, right, by doing the job you won't let me do because I don't have commercial experience. There's a joke in here somewhere, I'm sure.)

I also don't have a driver's license, which is a no-go for quite a lot of positions I've tried to apply for. (Of course, driver's license is very high up the list of things I need to get when I do get a job.)

As I mentioned at the start of this ramble, I'm not entirely sure where I want to go, career-wise. It's a toss-up between system administrator (Linux/UNIX), developer (Perl/C) or something completely unrelated. (I've been trying to pick up simple-ish work (Mostly more warehousing, some data entry), but it's rather a struggle since a: There are a lot of people applying for those jobs and b: I have to strip my CV down to almost nothing for things like warehousing, or I get round-filed again for being overqualified (Since the majority of what can be said on there is IT-related.))

Anyway, I think I've wasted enough of your time. I've tried to lay out where I am at the moment, what I can and can't do, why, and where I think I might want to go. I'm just hoping that someone can help me figure out what to do, because it's rather demotivating to be turned down for job after job.

If you want to point and laugh at my CV, it's [available here](http://furryhelix.co.uk/~tamber/cv.htm)
[(Print version)](http://furryhelix.co.uk/~tamber/cv.pdf)


I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, either; perhaps some reassurance it's not just me stuck in this rut and that there's a way out, or pointers on figuring out some way of finding a direction. Anything, I suppose, helps.

*How to apply*: PM and/or email to paul.curry@bluepodmedia.com

*Starting*: Immediately or as your notice period (if required) dictates.

I have been living in the UK for the past 15 months, I love it a lot, and boy has it gone fast! I am having to start to look at ways I can extend my stay here, and still have an eligibility to live and work here. 

I've cheked out the HMRC website, and got some info regarding sponsorship extensions, but I work mostly freelance and so therefore don't have a constant employer to count on for that. 

I wondered if anyone here was in the same boat or knew of any other, perhaps less obvious, options for renewing my Visa and extending my stay in the UK.

Thanks in advance! x

The caller said ""Hi I'm __, I'm 16, You may not know this but on New Years Eve I accidentally kissed my friends Dad... Anyway now its time for Scoooottt Miilllsss""

I found it pretty distasteful even if the feature is supposed to be humorous. Whether the person in question was a boy or girl I cannot believe the BBC find it 'ok' to air it as a joke.

Anyway I received this insulting and patronising reply from the BBC

&gt;Thanks for your contact regarding Scott Mills on 30 January.

&gt;I understand you had concerns with regards to a clip that was played regarding a 16 year old who kissed their friends dad, which you found to be in poor taste and I note your reference to a sinister undertone.

&gt;It’s important to put the clip into context and further into the broadcast, the individual concerned explained to Scott what had happened on New Year’s Eve.

&gt;The young man in question spoke to Scott and relayed the incident, whereby, on New Year’s Eve at a restaurant his friend’s dad was on the dance floor and due to the music being loud when he lent in to hear what he was saying, he accidentally kissed him. He also highlighted that his friend’s dad was horrified by what had happened.

&gt;The context was clearly humorous and there was no serious or sinister undertone as suggested. Regular listeners would be aware of the light hearted nature and content of the show.

&gt;However, I can assure you we appreciate your feedback on this issue and your comments have been fully registered on our audience log. This log is made available to all members of the BBC, including the production team of ‘Scott Mills’ and senior BBC management.

&gt;This ensures your comments and others we receive are considered across the BBC.

&gt;Thanks again for taking the time to contact us.

I used to be a huge fan of the BBC but over the past 3 months have found myself more and more critical on their service. Especially with their 'comments' section which is 'moderated' and from comments seems to be possibly more politically motivated than to stop obscenities.

Its up to the politicians and people to decide if Scotland will become independent or not.

To the UK redditors, I would like to pose the question that Scotland has becomes independent, what would actually happen to Scotland? What would happen to the UK? Is it in Scotlands/Britains best interest to become independent or is it in Scotlands/Britains best interest to keep Scotland in the union?

Several issues come to mind, hopefully this will start off the discussion.

First, would an independent Scotland be able to use the Pound as its national currency? or would it have to mint its own alternative currency? or would it have to join the Euro? Perhaps joining the Euro would be in Scotlands best interests as its exports would become cheaper.

Second, the UK's entire nuclear deterrence is based in HMNB Clyde which is in Scotland. What would happen to this base? Where would the UK relocate its nuclear submarine base to? Would Scotland have to form its own military? or Would the UK continue to defend Scotland?

Third, Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch have all said that an independent Scotland would not receive the same AAA credit rating the the UK has, this would mean higher borrowing rates for the Scottish government and higher rates for the consumer in Scotland. Would this ultimately negate any economic benefit from independence?

Fourth, would an independent Scotland be able to join the EU?... the EU has brought many economic benefits to Scotland, such as free trade with other EU nations. But an independent Scotland would have to apply for membership, (and we all know how long those take). What about NATO, UN, IMF, WTO membership?

There are so many issues which would need to be solved before Scotland can become independent, I have highlighted a few, but there will be many hundreds more. What would happen to North Sea oil (I highly doubt Westminster will give it over to an independent Scotland)? Would the BBC continue to broadcast in Scotland? Would all Scottish nationals living/working in England/Wales/Northern Ireland have to apply for a work/residency visa, and those that fail are deported to Scotland?

Ultimately, would an independent Scotland even be possible given how deeply Scotlands interests, both economically, culturally and politically lie with the rest of the UK?",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,default,What would happen to an independent Scotland?

First of all, before anyone says anything, I tried searching about this in [/r/unitedkingdom](/r/unitedkingdom) but the threads are mostly about setting up an account rather than the merits of one account over the other. 

I'm moved and settled and have everything I need to open an account, (passport, proof of address, and so on) i'm more worried about the safety of the money once I transfer it over (small nest egg, less than 20k) and access to the money should the shit hit the fan back home in Ireland if the EURO goes tits up and I need to get money home to a family member in a worst case scenario.


So, can anyone recommend an account that -

* Gives reasonably easy access to the funds (within two months, can be a deposit account I guess) 

* Actually gives a decent amount of interest. 

* Internet Access to funds, I don't need everyday access to it.

* Isn't run by a bunch of gangsters or isn't liable to go under in the short to medium term. Can be a building society or credit union if its the best place to put it in your opinion.

Any help, a link, some advice, anything, would be great as I need to sort this ASAP.

Here's the gist of what I'm asking:

So many things can be said about them all, but when I look at all of my Doctors as one Time Lord, I see this.

First Doctor: When he left Susan, I felt that it was a significant moment for the Doctor demonstrating absolute selflessness for the good of others. This act, letting go of his own granddaughter, opened up the world of the Doctor as a being alone in the universe. This was back when the Time Lords were still kicking, but he was no longer *Doctor Grandpa*, he was The Doctor.

Second Doctor: In contrasting the Two to One, Troughton's Doctor added a sort of silliness to the character. The Doctor was still all about serious business, worlds were still in peril, and he was still *very* stern when he needed to be, but Two introduced a child-like spark to the character that has also defined The Doctor ever since (with Two consecutive exceptions in the Eighth and Ninth Doctors, explainable in the Eighth being sort of outside canon and the Ninth's war).

Three: The Doctor became the man of action at this point. Before Pertwee's Doctor, we had Ian, Jamie, and the like who would do the heavy lifting for the Doctor. The Doctor, as a character, was older and physically frailer than his counterparts. We now have the Doctor as the 'man,' paving the way for a string of individual female companions.

Four: Tom Baker's Doctor was the lovable friend. He was Carl Sagan, Bill Cosby, and Pee-Wee Herman (without creepiness) all rolled into one, but he still maintained so many of the beloved strong characteristics of his previous Doctors. Before Baker, the Doctor was cool and interesting, but after Baker, the Doctor was someone we wished we could go with because of the man, not just the TARDIS.

Five: This Doctor was tough to determine, but in my opinion, Davison's Doctor began the position as the Doctor as the leader. This was accomplished by pairing him with younger companions who could more easily be portrayed as obedient followers of the Doctor. Not following the Doctor's orders even became fatal. 

Six: The Doctor is kind of crazy. Kind of... *too* crazy. Colin Baker played this role a bit too well at first. That said, he's an alien, damn it. Good for him. This is another characteristic that sort of falls aside for 8 and 9, though. Well, 9 is kind of crazy, but war veteran crazy, not weird crazy.

Seven: I really can't think of a single attribute that McCoy's Doctor contributed that hadn't already been introduced by another Doctor previously. I don't mean to say he wasn't a good Doctor, but I'm sort of writing this on the fly.

Eight: This Doctor, in my opinion, just didn't have a long enough tenure on-screen to have made a significant impact to the series character, but I understand he's kind of the king of audio-books. I am not qualified enough on that subject to have an opinion. I guess he kissed a chick, though. So there's the whole, ""The Doctor as romantic lead"" thing.

Nine: Unlike the isolation of the First Doctor after leaving Susan, Nine is alone in the most absolute way possible. Companions aren't just a means of keeping company any more. He has access to the entire universe and dimensions beyond, yet he is completely alone. This is the Doctor at his most emo... and he's *brilliant*. Even with The Master's occasional return, the Doctor is alone from here on out.

Ten and Eleven: Perhaps I could have come up with something a bit lasting to mention about them, but I'd only be postulating. There aren't enough Doctors after Ten to really look at his ultimate contribution, and Eleven is an even more difficult case.

So... anyone else have opinions about this sort of thing?

**PS3:** Anyone managed to get a PS3 working online here? It worked in my first year no problem, and it worked in my second year up until April 2010 when the PSN when down for a month, since then it hasn't worked at all. Every time I try to connect is gives me the error 80710092. This is the error that basically says you need to reset your router, something not possible on these ridiculously bad university connections (ridiculous in the fact the speeds are fantastic for downloads w/ no download limits, but everything else about it sucks).

Has anyone found a workaround for this and managed to get a PS3 online?

**Update:** Called ISS, since sony changed how the PSN worked after the blackout last year, the PS3 will no longer work on the university network. They know about this issue and it is intentional.

**Steam/TF2:** We gotta have some TF2 players here. I love playing TF2 but it gets a bit boring playing pubs some time, as the lack of coordination and actual teamwork is frustrating. So, does anyone wanna play some TF2? My steam ID is lord_of_valhalla.

My second TF2 question is about tf2lobby.com. Has anyone managed to get this to work. Whenever I try to connect to a lobby it just never connects, I'm guessing this is an issue with the university network blocking things not in certain ports, but surely there must be a work around.",false,lancasteruni,t5_2swbr,null,null,self,Gamers of Lancaster Uni!,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/lancasteruni/comments/pg6y8/gamers_of_lancaster_uni/

Landlords in St Andrews tend to give students rent periods that are not completely compatible with the time that they intend to spend in their flats. As a result you may end up paying a lot more than you have to just to have an empty property.

The solution is to sublet your place whilst you are away. This can be done safely and without major difficulties and is permitted by Scottish law.

At St Andrews Let we are here to take you through the steps, find your subtenants and manage your property whilst you are away. This will give you peace of mind and save you a lot of money.

To learn more, write to us on contact@standrewslet.com and we will get things going for you.

Please go into our website standrewslet.com to find out more.

This obviously means that I will be very well-qualified for one job in particular: secondary school history teacher. However, I am unaware of what I would need to do in order to get teaching certification in the UK, which is one reason why I came here. Could any teachers help me out?

Also, I'd like to know what locales in the UK are considered the best. I am perfectly fine in all sorts of areas; rural, suburban, urban, etc. it doesn't really matter. 

I am mainly looking to move to the UK simply because I want to travel the world. I have already spent a year in Japan while in university, which has put me into a perpetual state of wanderlust. I simply want to go to new places, with different cultures, traditions, etc. and live there. I figure that the UK would be one of the easier places to do that(considering how welcoming the country is to immigrants, and the fact you speak English).

Whilst I was at Uni, my parent and their partner sold the house we'd all lived in for years, they downgraded to a much smaller cramped house in a nicer area. After graduation I did stay up near uni for months living with friends, but my job's temporary contract wasn't extended and I could no longer afford to stay there. With little option, I had to move home I am very much *not welcome* at home by my stepparent, I don't even have a bedroom here either and have to sleep on the sofa. I can't have friends over because there are young kids here. I am truly lost and feel more suppressed the longer I do live here.

*I am currently unemployed, yes, but I am actively looking and having interviews soon.        
*I would live in a youth hostel or something for a while, but wonder if there is an alternative option?

Admittedly there is not a definition of what ""parental help"" is on this chart - unfortunately I wasn't able to find this on the document from [Savills Research](http://www.savills.co.uk/research/residential-research.aspx). I'm sure it will be a significant wedge of a deposit as opposed to help driving the removal van.

It clearly shows that the ratio which was already very high in 2006 has now shot up as mortgage lending has (rightly) tightened yet prices have not fallen due to ZIRP.

It spells out quite clearly: if you do not have wealthy parents you will not own a home in the UK.

**As a Team**

As a team, I think we've played quite well in the big matches. Except for the 4-0 loss to Spurs and the 3-0 loss to Man City (which seemed to have been a really unlucky result), we've matched teams in the top four if not out-played them. The problem we seem to have is that we overlook the middle table and lower table clubs. When we play these teams, we seem to always have a bigger match just around the corner that we seem to look forward to and instead of taking it each game at a time, we assume that we can play poorly and still win(see L 3-1 Bolton). As much as I hate to say it, the blame for this has to fall with King Kenny and Stevie. As manager and captain respectively, they need to fire up the lads for each match. It is their job to make sure that everyone on the pitch does their job. While I love both of these men, they need to do a better job at getting in the faces of the younger guys to make sure they follow the game plan. It was refreshing to see how Kenny tore into the team after the defeat to Bolton. We need to see more of this. If we want to make top four, we can't keep drawing against mediocre teams.

When we play the big teams(Spurs, United, City, Chelsea, Arsenal), we really seem to pick up our game to a whole new level. We've really dominated the past couple games we've had against these top teams, even if we only came out with a draw. The problem seems to be that our level drops against the lower teams for some reason. The draw against Spurs on monday was a mix of bad luck and bad touches in the final third. We easily outplayed that team at home, but couldn't get it into the back of the net. If we can get Suarez, Carroll, and Kuyt some confidence going into the final part of the season, we should be golden for fourth place.


**Pepe Reina**

Reina has been solid in the net. Besides for the first goal in the Premier League match against City, not many of the goals against us have been his fault. While it may not be his best season in the net, his distribution throughout the season has been marvelous. He captained the side for a good amount of games due to Gerrard's injuries as well as Carragher's poor form.


**Jose Enrique**

Obviously, Jose Enrique has been huge for us. Whether it comes to defending or going forward to attack, we can almost always count on him to be solid. I really hope the calf injury he sustained is not serious. While we do have other decent options at left back, Enrique is far better than any of them and should be a lock in for the future at that position. That said, his performance as of late has fallen a bit from his performance earlier in the season. Whether it is fatigue or lack of confidence, he has been the cause of quite a bit of the opponents goals(Park's goal in the FA Cup). I really doubt this has to do with confidence and is just a fatigue factor, considering he's played in a majority of the games this season. Hopefully, he comes back soon and continues to be solid for us.


**Daniel Agger**

Agger is a fucking stud. There really is nothing else to say about him. This has been one of his best seasons for us, if not the best. Defensively, no one gets the best of him. He's tall, strong, and intimidating. Offensively, he's probably one of the best center backs in the EPL. He makes runs forward with the ball and has great control while dribbling. While these runs open up the opposing defense, they do not put us in too much danger in the back. More often than not he draws fouls during  his run, earning us a free kick in an offensive position. Agger is a huge part of why we are going to Wembley and why we are in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Against City in the Carling Cup semis, he was the one to draw the two penalties which Stevie put away. Against United in the FA Cup, he scored on a header off a free kick. Agger is one of our most important players and I hope he stays at Anfield until the end of his career.


**Martin Skrtel**

Skrtel has been nearly as strong as Agger this season. While he does not have the offensive capabilities of Agger, his defensive skills are unmatched by anyone in the side. He probably has the best tackling form of anyone on the team, and makes the important tackles in every game. We really can call him the terminator after his incredible goal line clearance against Newcastle. Being the same age as Agger, I believe we are set for centre backs for quite a while. Hopefully, they both stay here for the remainder of their careers and I don't see any reason for them to leave.


**Glen Johnson**

In my opinion, Johnson is the weak link in the team. While his main position is right back, he hardly plays like one. Instead, he has the mindset of a right midfielder or even right winger. If he cannot make the transition to right midfielder to make space for Kelly, who I think has much greater potential than him, then he needs to be sold. We paid quite a bit of money for him, and I think we can still get a good sum for him. He has been in good form recently, but the problem with him is that he is not needed in the team for as much as we are paying him. He had a good game against Spurs on monday going forward. Luckily, he did not have much defending to do considering how defensive Spurs' game plan was. Still, though, he had quite a few bad crosses that basically killed attacking moves by the team.


**Martin Kelly**

Martin Kelly needs to be getting the regular start at right back. Already, I think he has more defensive skill than Glen Johnson, and he is only 21. Early play time for him will get him confidence going forward, which he can already do decently well. Being a Liverpool youth product, the fans already have a liking towards him, and for good reason. He is quite good at getting himself in the way of the pass or shot rather than relying on speed to out-maneuver his opponent as Johnson seems to do. He had some of the better crosses into the box on monday against Spurs, so that isn't a problem. He even made a couple creative passes to start the attacking play. He will be a great Liverpool defender for lots of time to come.


**Jamie Carragher**

Carragher has been great for us in the past. Unfortunately, though, his form is quite poor. The way that Agger and Skrtel are playing, it does not seem like Carragher has much to look forward to. Maybe it is time for him to retire and get the Anfield farewell that Hyypia got.


**Jay Spearing**

Spearing, for me, has actually played surprisingly well this season. He is still quite young and has much learning to do. While Lucas is out, Spearing should get quite a bit of play time. He has a great defensive mind. In fact, his play style seems to be that of a centre back rather than a defensive midfielder. Unfortunately for him, his lack of height will not allow for him to ever play at centre back, so he is stuck in the Sergio Busquets type role for Liverpool. While his defensive play may be spot on, his offensive play is some cause for concern. Though his pass completion percentage may be high, he gets the ball more than anyone of the pitch. His passes up the field this season have not been strong. He has caused attacking plays to die. On a team that does not score that many goals, we need to create as many chances as possible. Errant passes are not a good way to create passes. As I said before, though, he is still young and will get a good amount of playing time while Lucas is out. Hopefully he improves by the end of the season.


**Charlie Adam**

Oh boy. I actually feel kind of sorry for Charlie Adam. Besides for Carroll, he has been the most maligned of the Liverpool players due to performance, but this is not always his fault. The fact is that he's playing out of position. With Lucas out, we needed someone to fill the CDM role. Adam is not a natural defensive midfielder but rather an attacking midfielder. Unfortunately for him, we have many attacking midfielders on the roster that would get the nod before him. His lack of defensive knowledge shows when he gives up dangerous free kicks in the defensive half. In fact, he probably gives up one of two of these in every game. He is, however, a solid crosser of the ball. He does not get to do it very often due to his positioning on the pitch. Also, his passing is not bad, Going forward, his only problem seems to be picking out the correct pass. He is not able to think creatively and instead gives up the ball rather than pick out any of the passes. He is a pretty good long distance shooter as well with his rocket right foot. In my opinion, though, Spearing should start ahead of Adam.


**Lucas Leiva**

Oh we miss Lucas so much this year. I think the lack of goal scoring this year comes down to the lack of a solid defensive midfielder. Before he got injured, Lucas showed us how great of a defender he is and how well he can get forward on attacking plays. While our current defensive midfielders are good in their own right, Lucas is the hybrid mix of everything good with Spearing along with everything good with Adam. He was the last person in the team we needed to get injured this season. It seems to just be bad luck.


**Stewart Downing**

Now most of this subreddit seems to be annoyed with Downing’s lack of production for us. Though he’s had 23 appearances for us, I feel like he still hasn’t gotten used to the system at Liverpool. In my opinion, he should be starting on the left side of midfield in every game. Instead of using him as an outright winger, where goals are necessary and failure to score them leads to annoyed fans, play him as a left midfielder and give him creative freedom on the left hand side with Jose Enrique. If this does not work, thenmove him back to winger. While he may not score for us, he is one of the better creative minds we have, and we should take advantage of that.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Thoughts on the season so far....,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/phgin/thoughts_on_the_season_so_far/

It's like having an ice cream made of your favourite flavours and discovering that, when forced together, those flavours taste kinda nasty together.

Charlie Brooker's strongpoint is definitely not straight political commentary and David Mitchell is really not very good at interviewing guests, he approaches them with a preconceptions and bias and tries to railroad them into conforming to his preconceptions.  Like his Football interview on the most recent episode that made him look like he's just trying to set up opportunities to rant and getting slightly frustrated that the people he's interviewing aren't as stupid as he'd hoped.

I'm slightly disillusioned with the agencies, and besides, I prefer to do my future company a favour and not cost them more than I need to. 

I'm currently working for a technical consultancy in Old Street, London as a consultant project manager in the financial sector. We focus on implementations and bespoke development of Murex products using Agile / Scrum methodology. I'm on the project management side, my role includes training some of the internal teams on scrum (and to a certain extent Murex itself) and its purpose, as well as implementation of agile tools to be able to provide metrics for reporting upwards in a consistent fashion and to allow for continuous improvement to the teams involved.

I also speak Portuguese and Spanish fluently, as well as French and Italian to a conversational level. 

What am I looking for? A Scrum / Agile project whether contract or perm. 

And, just to prove I'm reddit worthy, yes, the narwhal does bacon at midnight. As well as it never being lupus.

I'm only keeping this up for a few more days in case my job falls though. Thanks for your interest.


**I'm looking for**: Programming jobs were I can get interested in the end product, and develop myself as a person and programmer. I have a wide range of interests, so some things might be interesting to me that might be boring to others. Some jobs I might be interested so I can develop my skills further. 

**My experience**: I did a BSc in Computer games programmimg, and started up a company, for which I did all the in house engines, tools and music. I also made [this music tool.](http://outlash.co.uk/grid.html)

**My skills**: Programming languages for various contexts (C++/AS3/HTML/Java), various programming interfaces and tools (Source Control, IDEs, Text editors), Prototyping, tools development, data management, event programming, object orientation, finite state machines, weak AI.

What sets me apart is my burning desire to keep software as simple as it can be, not to reinvent the wheel, write code that naturally comments itself, highly maintainable and various other tricks I've picked up from [The pragmatic programmer.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer)

**About me**: I'm a jack of all trades and interested in many fields like games, music and storytelling. I like teaching myself new things and generally improving as a human being. I have a lot of curiosity and I enjoy expressing myself and trying to make my ideas into reality. 

**How to contact me**: PM me first, then when I know I can trust you, I'll get in touch through your workplace email.

Heya reddit, it is time to ask ye some questions.

Terrible language aside, I’m just a teenager living in a really boring suburb of 50,000 in California. It’s quite wealthy, extraordinarily boring, yeah. Basically, you guessed it, I’m looking to get out. I don’t know exactly to where, but looking way ahead, in terms of job prospects (in 5 years) the UK is quite a good option for CS majors. Maybe not as good as the USA, but mehhhh. Although I’m not absolutely sure about this I will be entering university in the USA as a Computer Science major this coming fall. This summer I took a trip to the UK, and quite honestly it was an eye opener. I have already been to 35 US States and most of Western Canada, but I have to say that the UK was the best of the above. Still, there are obviously things that I am missing: I was only on holiday for 3 weeks, and I took a significant portion of that time to go up to Scotland. We never made it to wales, or much of NW England….
The trip was great, we saw some really touristy stuff, but also managed to get  into the suburbs meeting with old acquaintances and such. While in London we actually stayed in Norbury. Norbury was sorta nice. What is the general thought about Norbury? London was amazing, history, culture, density as such I’d never seen. The tube, it all. The rest of the country seemed just… better. A lot of it was probably novelty. What sucks about standard British “suburban” life, if you can call it that. In any case late in the trip we did a quick jaunt over to Paris, and when we took the ferry back over the pond to Heathrow, it was the third day of the London riots. Scary watching all those trucks go into the city.

Here is what I really enjoy about the United Kingdom: 

1. I have rather serious medical issues. Healthcare is good.
2. Even in smaller cities, density made it so that there were things to do. (super high density, small housing good thing in my book)
3. Dry sense of humo(u)r. 
4. Proximity to Mainland Europe/ability to access cultural diversity
5. Significantly easier for an English Speaker to acclimate.
6. Not where I live now.
7. Ability to get job with potential for advancement

These things might certainly change over time. After all, I am only seventeen, and although for the average American scrub I am culturally aware, College may put a whole new face on this.
In the UK there wasn’t a whole lot I didn’t like. Some rowdy people outside pubs, but that’s sort of to be expected, especially from what was frequently heard. Knife laws are fairly ridiculous, the price of gas and difficulty of driving is insane. VAT sucks as a tourist. At times I missed the British sense of humor, again, something that would come with time. Weather is a bit of a downer. I have a feeling it was abnormally good when I traveled.
I have a friend that lives in Scotland. Parents work for Chevron, so moved to my home city where the US headquarters of Chevron are. They moved back, and I’ve been in touch since. His parents actually offered to sponsor me, should I decide to go for whatever reason, but I’m not even sure how that works. I have study abroad, which is always a possibility…
What is boils down to:

*What exactly are job opportunities for Computer Science Majors? *What kind of experience is required to get a visa?
*Where are these jobs? London area, or in Manchester/Birmingham? *It’s possible they are elsewhere, but these are the three places that came up in discussion.
*Prospects of higher education?
*What is it like living as an expat in the UK?
*I know emigrating is not to be taken lightly, and there arem any serious obstacles and issues, but I would just like a general overview of whether it’s even something to think about.
*How is the work environment in comparison to the USA?
*Why should I do/not consider this?

Essentially, I’m trying to distinguish novelty and rose colored glasses from the reality. The UK is a wonderful country, but it is suffering and has suffered from many of the same issues as the rest.

Can anyone explain why this is said (statistics would be useful)?

It's an honest question, although I am heavily biased, I am open to the idea that he may be tactically poor and I have not realised, I just don't see why people say so.

The way I see it, Arsene Wenger is a good example of someone who is tactically poor. Despite his other incredible strengths, tactics isn't one of them. His entire approach is to teach a team to play a certain way then put them on the pitch and expect them to win, regardless of the opposition. 

By contrast, each game Kenny adapts the team to what he and Clarke see as the best tactical approach to the team that we are playing - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The success/failiure is due to a number of factors not simply that the tactics are poor (this season failiure seems alot to do with bad luck, poor finishing, a team in transition with players that are still adapting etc.) and I would argue that it is likely to increase over time as the squad, coaching staff, and managerial staff get more experience together. 

Indeed, in the big games this season, where tactics are arguably more important, we have generally been the better team. It is the games against ‘lesser teams’ where we have dominated possession but have not been able to finish them off that we have done poorly. To me this indicates a lack of clinical finishers and creative players – not necessarily tactics. Similar to the situation with Benitez, who everyone particularly pointed out to be a master tactician.

However, I have no stats to back this up and I welcome your views - particularly those who think he is tactically poor.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,"Why do people criticise Kenny as being poor

However, I've figured out a way to get a server running using hamachi and a hacked client and have been playing with my house since the beginning of term. I just thought it would be cool if we could get some other people from the uni on as well and get a lil Lancaster uni community going. Lemme know if you're interested and what you'd want from the server, (PVP on/off, difficulty, mods, aims, minecraft version etc) It would be awesome if we could get this project alive and kicking :)

Looking for a Developer in Test - or a Senior Developer in Test - to work in the News Architecture &amp; Systems team in BBC Future Media. We develop the systems and services underpinning BBC News online.

Full details on the BBC recruitment site, linked below.

Developer in test seems to be a bit of a rare role at the moment, though quite an interesting one.  It needs a good mix of skills covering coding, testing and agile practice.  It's been described as 'a second generation extreme programmer who focuses on testing and testability'.  There's a description in the job spec attached to the job ad on our recruitment site.

We have an active community of DiTs (DsiT I guess), and it is a role that looks to be growing.  See the links below for background.

I'm sure I'm not alone with this view, but minecraft is a fucking awesome game :) When you're shattered from working or just generally feeling unproductive there's nothing cooler then just collapsing in front of a game of minecraft. Unfortunately as you probably know, the ResNet thingy means it is a bit of a bitch to connect to external servers or even servers on campus. However, I've figured out a way to get a server running using hamachi and a hacked client and have been playing with my house since the beginning of term. I just thought it would be cool if we could get some other people from the uni on as well and get a lil Lancaster uni community going. Lemme know if you're interested and what you'd want from the server, (PVP on/off, difficulty, mods, aims, minecraft version etc) It would be awesome if we could get this project alive and kicking :)

Then, while taking the letter to the bin, I noticed in *miniscule* text at the bottom reverse of the letter, a line which informed me that I was **entitled to cancel my contract if unhappy with the price increase, without penalty.** The increase is in April, and you need to give 30 days notice.

So, I was actually gloating when I rang them to cancel. Not just because I had been wanting to leave them anyway, but the I abhor the misleading way in which they try to make their customers believe that they can increase their prices without penalty. I'm sure this is the case with most contract services, but I'd have much more respect for a company if they treated me with enough respect as to inform me of my rights in a given situation, rather than me accidentally discovering them.

I live in another country but I am European. I'm planning on moving to the UK with my partner and my two dogs and have been looking for a house since the beginning of January. I don't need much, but as I do not have a bank history and I do not know anyone living in the UK (and want to rent through a estate agent), I'm willing to pay 6 months in advanced. It has been really difficult finding a house that accepts two dogs and that trust me without a bank history and all that, within my budget.

I have decided on Southend-On-Sea, and I've only found one house in all of the surrounding areas that meet my needs. The problem is that it's being let through Vink Estate Agents, a really small company that only has one website, cannot find in a map, but seems trustworthy nonetheless. But, as I do not find any reviews, and as I need to send money directly to a bank account (not the 6 months rent just £400) to get the house secured until the first days of April (when I'm moving in), I'm not sure what to do.

Can you help me decide if I should trust them? I would welcome any info on Vink Estate Agents or even a general idea if you think this is right or if I should go any other way.

He's talking about us, being the only nuclear power in all of latin America. He's talking about us upgrading our air power. He's talking about us being a collapsing colonising nation that should be confronted via the UN? LOL, the only military in the UN that could talk to us would be America. We join them and actually spearhead their military with our special forces.

He keeps answering English asked questions in Spanish. That's a show of ignorance and stupidity. He's saying that we called Argentina 'colonialist', then talking about history. America, Canada, Australia.. sure. But why shouldn't we apologise for slavery if we're going to be apologetic for colonialism? Give some wealth to African nations that we took those slaves from in the past? Argentina prime minister is short sighted when he speaks about that.

Now sky news is asking correspondents questions instead of keeping us watching the interview with the argentinian prime minister/president/whoever the fuck this nomark is. 

Now that it's finished. What are your opinions? 

Bare in mind, when we found the island, literally.. we found it. Finders keepers etc. When we found it, NOBODY lived there. Recently we discovered there's oil under the waters around it. Argentina wants to drill there, why shouldn't BP or another British oil company drill there though? It's our island, because we found it first.

Whatever bullshit he spouts, I believe we should actually talk to him. Tell him to be quiet or he'll be killed. We join America in so many of their wars, even though Libyan oil still ends up in our engines of the cars we drive, we should remember we're still a force to be reckoned with. There will be nukes that can be transported via lorries labelled 'tesco', with missiles that could devastate other international countries. This won't be known to us because 'secrecy is key to victiory', as my grandads booklet said when he fought in Africa in WW2 which I still have in my house.

I would love a 'sir', infront of my name and to be able to speak for the UK to the UN. Mark Grants job is to relay all of this information shortly, to the UN (or Americans - no other military could threaten us to the point of total annihilation) 

So, is there any way I can sign up a military novice but to serve 2 or 3 years in the Flaklands? I'd gladly fight to keep an island that says it's British as British. I'm beyond politics and would honestly die to keep the Falklands as our territory, anybody else feel this way?

Some links on volunteering to keep our territory British (such as the falklands - which would exclude service in the middle east) would be appreciated.

As you can see, this place is pretty new and empty, so I'd like to use this post as a place to discuss discuss what everyone would like to see on /r/Plymouth.

 
**Content** - Firstly, [we just need stories](http://www.reddit.com/r/plymouth/submit) to fill the page. Anything to do with Plymouth and the surrounding area (including Torpoint and Saltash). Your own personal experiences or questions about Plymouth. The more articles there are to read, the livelier this subreddit will be. 

I will allow NSFW links on here so long as they're related to Plymouth, but make sure you label them as such.

 
**Become a Mod** - Do you have an interest in Plymouth? Think you could do a good job promoting this subreddit and bringing together the community? If so, [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=doddyuk) and I'll add you as a Mod.

 
**Flares** - What do you think? Are they needed for a subreddit like this? Any suggestions are welcome.

If you have any other suggestions then by all means please leave a comment here. Thanks for reading!",false,plymouth,t5_2sh6u,null,null,self,Moving forwards with /r/Plymouth [Announcement],6,http://www.reddit.com/r/plymouth/comments/pk0iu/moving_forwards_with_rplymouth_announcement/

The obvious answer is The Eleventh Doctor, suggesting that when the question is asked and Silence must fall, it will mean the end of Eleven and another regeneration.

But this is Moffat we're talking about. Nothing is ever so obvious or simple. Being put right in front of us like this, it seems like it has to be a red herring. The REAL Moffuck would be it being such an obvious red herring that it's actual not, and he really is just telling us when the regeneration will happen. 

For the sake of discussion, let's say it's not the regeneration. What else might it be? I don't necessarily have any ideas myself, but I'd be interested to see what you guys can come up with.

Kick-off is at 15:00 PM GMT / 10:00 EST / 09:00 PST.

Everton are the less glamourous team based in Liverpool. Coached by the well-respect David Moyes, they've managed to do quite well for themselves despite a massively limited budget. Players to watch our for include Baines in defense, Fellaini in midfield, Donovan and Drenthe on the wings, and Cahill in attack. Phil Jagielka and Seamus Coleman, first-choice centre-back and right back respectively, Jack Rodwell, one of their best midfielders, and Leon Osman, midfielder, all miss out through injury.

Chelsea won the first match this season 3-1 at Stamford Bridge, with goals from Sturridge, Terry and Ramires. We also defeated Everton 2-1 in the Carling Cup at Goodison, with goals from Kalou and Sturridge.

----
**Team news**:

Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou remain unavailable at the ACoN. This should be the last game they miss as the tournament concludes on Sunday. Cote D'Ivoire advanced to the finals of the tournament where they will play Zambia.

Terry (knee) and Ramires (knee) will miss out. Ashley Cole is back from suspension, and Lampard (calf) and Mikel (hamstring) are expected to return.

Its obvious Suarez feels that he was wronged and I don't blame him.

As the media raises hell over this I can only hope they notice the classless taunting at the end of the game by Manchester United players.

The only time I was impressed with him was when Evra celebrated right in front of him.  He showed some self control that he hasn't shown in his time at LFC or, I would argue, in his career.

This is a player who **bit** another player while in Holland.  He's a loose cannon.  He's a great player and I would love to keep him in the team but his actions today are inexcusable after everything Kenny and the owners have done to defend him.

not suggest that the conflict is primeval or beyond reason. That
Catholics in Ulster feel Irish, and Protestants feel British, and that both
countenance violence to vindicate their identities, is not peculiar. The
twentieth century attests to the willingness of many peoples to fight, kill, and die to preserve their national way of life. This nationalism does not
have a very long history. In the pre-modern age ‘nation’ meant little
more, often less, than religion, clan, or region. But nor is it yet a thing of
the past. Almost every state in the world bases itself upon a shared sense
of belonging and mutual obligation that is patriotic or nationalistic. It is
hard to imagine democracy operating otherwise. Almost every
government strives to defend its national culture against erosion, and
puts the welfare of its people before all.

Northern Ireland’s tragedy is that its people have not been able to agree upon a common identity. Rather than stand by each other, they
compete. Being so alike – in language, appearance, and broad culture –
they cling tenaciously to that which marks them out. The successful
consolidation of either British unionism or Irish nationalism, it is
feared, will submerge the other. Other people’s identity is secure
because it is buttressed by a state. Their shared nationalism is often
mere background to the more important pursuit of personal
development. In Northern Ireland, that luxury has been lacking.
Neither nationalists nor unionists feel they may rest easy. Everyone who
feels part of a community, and would defend the privilege of that
belonging, can identify with Ulster’s plight.""

It is also, often, full of strange people dressed as star  was characters, and bald guys who lick your cheek whilst you try and smoke .

Now, I have a house . Not a particularly nice house, but a house nonetheless. A house easily accessed from the city centre, and with a convenient pub where non locals can congregate until they are collected. And an idea has begun to grow in my mind .

What if, instead of going out, we had a night in at mine . Twice as much beer for half the money from the local off license (five steps away from my door, don't bother lugging heavy booze across town) , snacks and nibbles, comfy seating well away from face licking weirdos (barring the cats), and space to kip  over if you bring your own pillow .

Now such an event would have to be held on a sunday - since that's the day my daughter goes to her dads overnight, and frankly I don't want you unsavoury lot corrupting her. I would of course book the following Monday off, so there would be no need for anyone to have to leave early in the morning, and bacon sandwiches may even be available.

I'm not a football fan. So I've no idea who these guys are.

So it appears the Spanish guy said something ""racist"" to the black guy. And the Spanish guy didn't shake the hands of the black guy.

But the black guy aggressively physically grabbed the arm of the Spanish guy. Last time a black guy aggressively grabbed my arm it was followed by a punch from another, much bigger, black guy. How was that acceptable?

Isn't it possible the Spanish guy used the ""racist"" insult because he was so angry with the black guy?

Now, I just finished watching the two part special where Tennant regenerates. Near the end, when the Doctor, the Master and the Time Lords are all together, the Master has a small monologue where he talks about how he changed everyone on Earth, and that he can do the same to the Time Lords. He mentions his ""Master Race"". We can all agree that the Master is a genius, but a madman. And I know what I'd do with 9 billion copies of me with a mind like that....EXTERMINATE! I know one of the Time Lords changed everyone back, but what's stopping the Master from doing that again? I heard a rumor, maybe it was here, that the Master is making an appearance in the upcoming season.

Let me explain: American yid here... About 3 years ago, at the urging of a friend, I decided to get into club football. He wanted me to follow Arsenal, as he had been a big fan for a long time, but I decided to study up first. After reading [Bill Simmons Article on picking an EPL team](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060719), I narrowed potential clubs to Arsenal and Spurs. After a little more research into the two clubs' histories... I absolutely fell in love with Spurs and haven't looked back.

I'm from a city and went to a school where college ([American] football and basketball) rivalries are particularly venomous. I've been immersed in hatred for these rival teams for so long that it comes naturally and is a big part of supporting my teams. So, I understand this is likely how you yids from across the pond feel about Spurs-Arsenal. But, I haven't had exposure to the nastiness of this North London rivalry. In fact, several good friends are Arsenal supporters and they haven't really given me any hard times. So, I feel like I'm missing out on an important part of this great rivalry. **To fix this, I'd like to hear all of your stories about Arsenal that will make me hate them!!**

**TL;DR:** I don't really hate Arsenal... I don't really have any reason to except that I'm ""supposed to"". I'm hoping you all can help me out by telling stories about why I totally should!

He seems to always have a human by his side to travel time and space with him.

Much like many of the traveling hippies I've known have had dogs with them.

The Doctor stole a car and hit the road with his granddaughter.

Along the way, she brought home two stray humans and said to daddy ""Can I keep them, pleeeeese?""

The Doctor said ""sure"" and along they went on their adventures.

The Doctor grew fond of having humans about the TARDIS, so from then on he was sure to always keep one around.

Now, to us, the human viewers and the human companions, traveling in the TARDIS must be akin to taking your dog in your car on the highway.

""HOW DOES THIS THING GO!!???!!!??  WHO CARES!??!!?  WE'RE SOMEWHERE MAGICAL AND NEW!!!!""

Just like that dog, the human companions are just along for the ride, hanging their heads out the window and wondering at the mystical spectacle of it all.

tl;dr

The Doctor = Wandering Hippie

A Companion = The Doctor's Stray Dog

There's that CIA dude whose name I forget from The Impossible Astronaut/ Day of the Moon, the thin fat gay married Anglican marines, and that rather attractive silurian from A Good Man Goes to War. 

What I also noticed was that their sexual orientation was pretty much just used for a couple of funny one-liners. I, personally, would really like to see a more meaningful LGBT character on the show, maybe a LGBT companion? Don't get me wrong, any LGBT awareness on the show is good, but it always seems to be used as a comedic device. Captain Jack is the only character I can think of who was written to have his sexual orientation be very much a part of him, and almost all of that took place on Torchwood. So yeah, as a queer girl, I'd very much like to see sexual orientation not be used only as a joke.

Also, I do realize that it's a kid's show, but why not have a homosexual lovey-dovey relationship similar to that of Amy and Rory?

Thoughts?

**TL;DR Lots of gay supporting characters on the show, but not a lot who don't have their sexual orientation used for some sort of gag.**
