It seems like a lot of us, myself included, are interested in going to this game. Our sub isn't going to sell the thing out on its own, so let's share information!

Here's what we know and what we need to know:

* **""Fan pack"" tickets are already on sale.** You can buy them [here](https://tickets.releventsports.com/Online/default.asp). However, one ticket costs $99 and [comes with](http://internationalchampionscup.com/fpland/) a Liverpool scarf, commemorative ticket to lower-level fan section, and a Liverpool lanyard. It's also worth noting you probably don't need to buy these right away; according to the sale site, fan pick tickets are still available for *all* games.

* **Regular ticket presale**: IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THE CODE IS **CORNER**. All caps. However, it looks like they may be sold out of all the cheaper tix in the Liverpool fan section, but you can still get those via the fan pack above. I was going to buy through ticketmaster, but that was going to cost $100 apiece anyway, so shit...might as well get some scarves for my money, too. 

* **Liverpool fan sections**: which sections are going to be all or mostly Liverpool fans, does anyone know?

EDIT: /u/eisla adds: ""According to the fan pack tickets' seating chart, the Liverpool supporters section are in 134-136 and the three 2xx sections directly behind them. This may or may not correspond to what goes on pre-sale tomorrow, as I think the fan packs are sold through a different system than TicketMaster.""

EDIT 2: [Here's an image of the seating at Yankee stadium](http://i.imgur.com/qDob5Vn.jpg) with the sections /u/eisla mentions highlighted, as well as a list of some nearby sections. But please note this is just based on his comment, not any official announcement that I have seen.

* **Who will be there?** Am I right in speculating that in a world cup year, both the Liverpool and Man City teams are likely to not feature many/any of their international players? On the one hand, that would be totally understandable. On the other hand, I don't really want to pay $100/ticket and drive seven hours one way to watch the U-21 team play...(though, who am I kidding, I will still do it)

* **Where will the team be training?** and when/where might there be other opportunities for meeting players/getting autographs?

Thanks to /u/eisla for [this informative thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/202shc/liverpool_vs_man_city_friendly_yankee_stadium_730/). As more information comes in I will try to keep this updated; if you have info on this game please share it in the comments! YNWA

For example, Suarez was a top player at Ajax but not many would even have him in the top 10 of strikers when we signed him. Dalglish was a top player in the Scottish Football League but not necessarily a coveted player internationally when we signed him (apparently LFC were the only club to contact Celtic about his availability). 

A lot of our top players either came through the academy (Gerrard, Carra, Fowler, Owen), signed incredibly young (Rush, Keegan, Aldridge)  or became significantly better after being signed (Suarez, Hyypia, Barnes, Souness)

So who is the best player at the time of signing for Liverpool? I'm inclined to say it's Torres, but what do you guys think? Dalglish is certainly in the debate.

Next year I am amazingly spending 6months on a student exchange to either Berlin or Brussels.

I will be spending my ""travel"" money on weekends to go to as many soccer games as I can around Europe, however my priority is Liverpool. This will be my best opportunity to finally see my favourite team. Words cannot explain how excited I am to finally go to Anfield.

I was wondering what is the best way to prepare myself for next years tickets, how do I become a member to get priority tickets etc.

Do you know another human being that finds the Emperor Dalek ""SO CUTE!""?

And we had to make up lies to make sure that he didn't lose all faith in reality when Rose eliminated the Daleks from existence.

So, here comes my question:

Do any Daleks die? 

He wants to see some, but if they die, he'll start crying, and ruin the experience for everyone. I don't want that, so please respond. Thanks!

Especially if we want to be in the top 4. So who do you guys think we should go after in the summer? While I would love to say that we could just go out and get Alaba or Alba and be magical like that I know it won't happen.

However I do think that there are some great LB's that are within our budget and might be willing to come play here...

Interestingly enough they are both named Marcel(l).... This one being Marcel Schmelzer currently playing for Dortmund. Now I know it can be very hard to lure German players away from the bundesliga, especially if they are in the starting XI at a club like Dortmund. However I think that Schmelzer and his very consistent and defensive style of play are exactly what we need on the left. He is very good on the ball and insanely good at winning the ball back. His one downside is that he is not the best in the final 3rd. 

Secondly I would say Marcell Jansen from Hamburger SV. Another solid German left back who is better going forward than Schmelzer but not as good in defense. However he is solid on the ball, and can pick out a better pass than Walker can from the right. His pace is not blistering but i'd be willing to say he's faster than Benny was. There is one glaring problem with Jansen though. He is already 29 compared to Schmelzers 26, and I think for now we have to focus on a defense for the future and not just the next 2 years. 

With age in mind I would undoubtedly go for Schmelzer if we can get him. Maybe when Holtby goes off for the WC (which if ze Germans are smart they will take him along) he can put in a good word about us.

The media has blown what he has said out of proportion and we're just taking out our frustrations of the recent 4-0 lost on him.

All he mentioned was that he preferred playing a more central position rather than at left-back and that he would like Spurs to compete in the CL next year. And just because of that, we're claiming he's thinking he's above the club and ""pouting"" which is absolute shit. The press just exaggerated every word he said and made him seem like the villain forcing his way out, which I highly doubt.

Who doesn't have a string of mediocre performances? Paulinho, Chadli, Townsend, Sigurdsson are all as guilty as he is, some even more so. Heck, even our beloved Chirches and Lamela make really dumb mistakes. This doesn't mean that they're bad players. Same goes for Verts. He's an **outstanding** center-back. Only a few weeks ago, we were calling him one of the best in Europe and that Barcelona were after him, which is a testament to how good he is.

The Current plan is, I front the deposit (around 60%) and my SO gets a mortgage. 
I haven't worked since my dad died as depression and anxiety hit me like a truck, and he can probably get a 90-100k mortgage. I'm doing better and plan on doing a course in the summer/autumn which will get me the piece of paper that 'proves' that I can do what I say I can. So I fully intend to be employed by the end of the year. (Previously I worked in back office banking and PPI claims, so my usual wage was 15-17k)
 
Now, the question is, is it even mildly possible for me to get a mortgage, while unemployed? I'd only be looking for an extra 15-20k. Would it be feasible under a joint mortgage? will banks be more forgiving when the deposit is larger? My history isn't great but that was often out of my control.

  So, how about we say [The Devonshire Arms](https://www.individualpubs.co.uk/devonshire/) this time. 7pm on the 22nd March? If folks are free this weekend (15th) I'd be cool with that too, but it feels like it'd be better to give everyone more of a chance to see this! On the night we could maybe decide on our next target.


I have my Cards Against Humanity deck back now, as well as a couple of other neat little party card games, so they might be fun if we can find an appropriate table.


Give us a shout below if you're in!

Hi scouse friends.

I hope you're enjoying your season in the top four. We plan to knock you off the perch again next season so have fun while it lasts. Wink

Anyway, I'm here from http://www.Unitedreds.net a brand spanking new United forum and we are trying to put together a blog and thread on ask the oppo. 

I'll keep it short, and thanks in advance for any replies guys.

Question 1
Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

Question 2
What are your realistic expectations for this season?

Question 3
Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

Question 4
Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

Question 5
Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

Question 6
We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

Question 7
What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

Question 8
Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season. 


Finally feel free to join in the debate over at United Reds providing you can give and take banter, opposition fans are welcome.

Don't get me wrong, I really loved all of the companions, but to me Donna was the best for the Doctor because of the unromantic feelings between them which could allow both the Doctor and the audience to focus purely on the adventures between them without complicating things. 

Rose's run hurt because she was there for so long with an underlying attraction between her and the Doctor. Then Doomsday happened (sob) and was tough on both of them and it showed with the Doctor throughout Martha's run. I'm positive the Doctor knew Martha liked him but I feel as though he didn't want to feel back because of what happened with Rose and the pain that came with losing her. Many times the Doctor would refer to Rose and to me Martha just seemed like the rebound companion who fell for the Doctor knowing that she'd be second fiddle. Then enter Donna with her sass and 'charm' who's condition upon entering the tardis was the whole ""no feelings, just be a right proper companion"" deal.  She was just a friend to the Doctor which is just what he needed and that is why I love her so much and why I think she was the best companion FOR the Doctor. I don't know if this a shared opinion amongst the whoniverse because I'm still relatively new to it but I think she played a more important role than people (or just my friends) gave her credit for. Obviously this is just my opinion though so people may disagree but without trying to sound cheesy, she was just what the Doctor ordered.

I am taking a coach load of children from South Devon to Birmingham NEC and want to put together a couple of 'spotter sheets' to keep them busy on the journey. The 'easy' version is done - it consists of logos that are practically guaranteed to be seen en route (mostly on the sides of lorries etc) so that's fine. It's the 'trickier' version I'm after help with.

For this version, I want to include things that are specific to the journey - so the kids have to be really paying attention to spot them. Things I have so far include:
The Exeter M5 Footbridge
A 'Welcome to Somerset' sign
The Wellington Monument
The two [model] camels in the field near Bridgwater
The wicker sculpture near the Glastonbury junction
The Morrisons depot near the Glastonbury junction
The tower of lights near Weston-super-Mare
The RAC control tower at Bristol
The ASDA supercentre at Cribbs Causeway
The Severn Bridge
A 'Cadbury World' tourist sign

~~Will try to add CityTV links as they're posted.~~

Pre-match press conferences with Kompany and Pellegrini are on the [official site](http://www.mcfc.com/).

Team News:

Dzeko came on against Wigan and should be available for the full 90 minutes, but Pellegrini is likely to go with Aguero and Negredo.

Jovetic and Nastasic are still injured.

With Demichellis' red card last game, he'll be ineligible this game, meaning it'll likely be Lescott with Kompany.

I am taking a coach load of children from South Devon to Birmingham NEC and want to put together a couple of 'spotter sheets' to keep them busy on the journey. The 'easy' version is done - it consists of logos that are practically guaranteed to be seen en route (mostly on the sides of lorries etc) so that's fine. It's the 'trickier' version I'm after help with.

For this version, I want to include things that are specific to the journey - so the kids have to be really paying attention to spot them. Things I have so far include:
The Exeter M5 Footbridge
A 'Welcome to Somerset' sign
The Wellington Monument
The two [model] camels in the field near Bridgwater
The wicker sculpture near the Glastonbury junction
The Morrisons depot near the Glastonbury junction
The tower of lights near Weston-super-Mare
The RAC control tower at Bristol
The ASDA supercentre at Cribbs Causeway
The Severn Bridge
A 'Cadbury World' tourist sign

...and then I'm stuck! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, particularly of anything further north than Bristol, which is why I'm calling on you lovely folks at /r/brum!

Seriously, I think Jackson Lake and his son would be the best companions ever, it's because he knows a lot about the doctor, he already knows what the TARDIS is, knows the doctors history, he knows a lot about the doctor. Lake's son would be cool because of the same reason people like Carl from the Walking Dead.

buying the album and emailing me the MP3s. I would send an amazon gift card or paypal for the cost. 

creating an amazon.co.uk account, buying the album, then giving me the username/pass and I'd credit your main account.

Arsenal vs Bayern

Can't see Arsenal getting past Bayern- the latter got complacent the last time around, but I don't see them doing the same thing twice, specially with Guardiola at the helm. 

Atletico Madrid vs AC Milan

Wont be watching with this one, but it'll be interesting to see how Atletico cope with added pressure throughout the season. Also if Adel Taarabt plays today (who has already made some interesting implications about Lamela with his performances)

I am using the recent Vertonghen incident as it has caused much, what I feel is repeated discussion around players who seemingly want to further their development at the cost of the club.

I work in IT, i'm sitting in a fairly cushty job, it's easy, and it pays pretty well. My friend is extremely jelous of this, and wants what I have. He is currently a low earning apprentice in a shithole.

My point is, we are fans of Spurs. I must say ten times a year that I'd sell my soul to play for Spurs, I get posed the question of whether I'd play for free, or whether I would rather play for Spurs for free or Real Madrid for 100k p/w, and I say Spurs, all day long. This is all because I am fan, and though my love for football is so large, it would diminish substantially if Spurs were to disband. 

Making sense of my earlier anecdote, players are not fans. They might be, or have been, when they were younger, but they must do what's best for their career and personal development, it's only human to have that need for progression. I love Microsoft, I really do, I'm a huge fan and always have been, but i wouldn't think twice about working for anyone else over them if I got a better offer. If they see what they see as their equal, in the case of my friend and I, they want to progress themselves and get there, just as my friend wants my job.

Now do we as a fanbase (football, not Spurs particularly) expect the loyalty of these people over their personal development? My current job is also my first job, and I wouldn't bat an eye to leave if a better deal came along, as would most people, is it any different? Do circumstances matter, whether we gave them their 'big chance'?

I do not want to create another Vertonghen discussion, I was merely using it as an example of bigger incidents such as Bale, Modric and Berbatov. it's also debatable whether it is a similar situation, again I do not think there is much point in discussing that just yet.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,A different view on the larger picture of the Vertonghen debacle,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2066ug/a_different_view_on_the_larger_picture_of_the/

Please let me know what you think. Am i right, or have i gotten everything absolutely wrong?

What is troubling our defense? 

This season we’ve already scored a total of 73 goals, and at the time the most scoring team in the premier league (although City have a few games in hand). Simple logic states the more goals you score, the more likely you are at winning matches. Now by that logic we should be at the top of the table, however we are not. So where have we gone wrong? Individual mistakes seems like the Achilles heel of this Liverpool team, we’ve seen several own goals and back passes that lead to goals in the wrong end. I have questioned since the hiring of Brendan Rodgers whether his defensive tactics are the reasoning behind all the goals against, or are the defensive players just not fit or not good enough for this type of system. 

Skrtel has been a somewhat “consistent” defensive player for Liverpool this season, being the one who’s started the most matches. He has played 26 out of 28 matches so far this season, and has scored 4 goals in the league so far. Half of those goals were scored in the stunning performance against Arsenal. I personally like Skrtel think he’s a very good, traditional center back. However he is not a player molded for the Brendan Rodgers type of style, this is very apparent in his passing game. This season we’ve seen several individual mistakes from this player leading to goals in the opposite direction, and when played with Kolo beside him gives me trouble sleeping at night. He has a bad habbit of pulling players in the box and I’m surprised he hasn’t been booked for it more than he has. 

Kolo Toure the summer signing that surprised me the most, but he was a welcome addition to our thin line of defense after Carra, and seemingly the lack of trust Brendan has in Coates. Kolo in his prime would have been the perfect center back for Liverpool, a pacey defender with ball control and a good pass. As age often does, it hasn’t treated Kolo too well, he lacks pace and often it seems concentration. After his horrible attempt of a pass against West Brom leading to the 1-1 goal, I buried my head deep into my hands pondering what the intention of that pass was. I’m not going to be too critical because he seemed very fresh in the start of the season, maybe we’ll be lucky enough to see that side soon again. 

Although we’ve only seen this friendly giant feature for us a total of 12 times, he seems to be the sharpest of the bunch. I was always happy to see him on the team sheet, I felt confident with him in our back four. We haven’t seen too much of him yet, making it hard to really rate him properly. He’s got a decent amount of pace for such a big beast of a man, and lacking in physicality would be the joke of the year. Being a reasonably young 24 year old, I’m very excited to see what he will do for us in the coming years.
Now to talk about everyone’s favorite, the Danish Viking, Daniel Agger. No one can argue his passion and love for the club, which is why he’s become such a fan favorite, along with being a brilliant player. Daniel and Martin were once the best defensive partnerships in the league under Kenny Dalglish. One would argue that Agger is much better suited for the Rodgers “tiki-taka” system than Skrtel, but like Martin hasn’t really seemed to adapt very well to the system. I would like to see Agger and Sakho together once they’re both fit, although it’s taboo to play two left footed central defenders together. He’s unfortunately been out with injuries this season, only allowing him 14 appearances, 3 where he was subbed on. I’m hoping to see him more involved in the remaining 10 games of the season, we’ll need him. 

It seems that Rodgers hasn’t quite found his favorite defensive pair this season so far, unfortunately injuries has seen him unable to test which pair works the best, and has even been forced to use Skrtel and Toure together in a great deal of games. To answer what I questioned earlier, I honestly believe Rodgers has gotten the defensive tactics down, and we do have the defensive quality in our team to achieve more clean sheets but the individual errors need to stop; and that’s a hard nut to crack!

Ok. Now last week I took an overdose with the intention of killing myself! After I took them I went to sleep (hoping I would pass) but woke up 14ish hours later and went to hospital because I obviously didn't take enough to the job I wanted (which was surprising because the pills I took is one of the easier pills to supposedly kill yourself with) The nurses at the hospital were fantastic and one girl in particular really got me.  She was called Libby, had beautiful red hair, was very happy, very nice, very chatty and treated everyone the same.  

I've always been a nice guy despite being treated lie crap most of life but that incident and meeting that girl opened my eyes to what I really want to do in life. I want to get into social care and truly help genuine people who need help but I need advice on what to do and how to go about it. As I said at the start I have a history of depression+anxiety plus memory issues which is the stumbling block. I just want some advice/your thoughts on my situation, what I can do to become what I want to be, how hard will it be and how to go about it.


EDIT: Thanks guys! You've all been great and very helpful :)

1. Does Oxford accept transfer students? (I couldn't find any info in this vein on their website).

2. In American terms, what sort of grades will I need in order to be considered/accepted?

3. Are there any prerequisite courses for physics? (American universities tend to require their transfer students to have completed a long list of courses at their community college before they are considered).

I have a pretty limited choice on the funds, and what’s there doesn’t have much information, so really it comes down to asset allocation. I’m 30 and hoping to retire as early as possible, but it’s still decades before I can access this cash, so I’m pretty relaxed about risk for the time being.

The plan as it stands: Ride down through France, drink wine, eat croissants, fresh bread, hop over the Alps into Italy, red wine, fresh bread, meats, cheese, pizza, fly home.

As you can probably tell, this is very much intended to be a gastronomic trip as much as a cycling trip. I plan to not really work to an itinerary and just ride as and where depending on how I feel.

Unfortunately this lackadaisical approach means most of my friends cant really commit as they have real jobs and cant take the time off work (or they dont like me....Hmmm.)

I'll be happy enough to do the trip on my own but some company would be nice. So, does anyone fancy it? I'm a 29 year old guy with an African Sunset toned beard who enjoys good food :o)

Also if anyone has any hint or tips then it would be appreciated. I've never done a ride this long before.

does anyone else think this list is viable? I honestly think drogba comes back to end his career here. Lukaku leads the front after a successful world cup.  We use our buyout with partially owned larkovic.  We offload torres and demba. We offload bertrand and kalas.  Maybe we can add piazon or thorgan into this list.

I've an interesting developer role, so I thought I'd share it with you. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to drop me an email. 

Job title: Front-end Developer

Description: I can go into depth about the in's and out's of the role, and the client via a phone call, but they're a creative design and build agency established in 2012. They are looking for a FED comfortable with working from home to work on numerous ongoing projects. 

Location: 100% Remote. Work from home in your pants if you must, but once a month there's a scrum meeting in Winchester.

Salary: Looking to hire a range of devs, reflective in the £30-£40k salary banding.

Requirements: Classic FED, with an interest in design. 

It'd be nice if: You have a portfolio of responsive work.

Added Bonus: Obviously total remote working is great, but they also offer a company laptop and phone.
How to contact: PM or drop me an email to Kieren@wearefutureheads.co.uk

So we all know that Lucas was a valuable part of the starting 11 before the injury, but the squad has gelled pretty well without him. Gerrard has overcome a shaky start and has settled in nicely into the holding position. Allen recently displaced Sterling in the starting 11, but Sterling completely changed the game after coming on for a disappointing Coutinho. 
My choice would be Coutinho and Allen off, Sterling and Lucas in. Coutinho has shown flashes of brilliance recently, but has been wildly inconsistent all season. Put Lucas in front of the CBs, move Gerrard up with Henderson and Sterling. And obviously SAS. Then rotate Coutinho in as needed with Henderson/Sterling/Allen/Gerrard. 
If you disagree with Coutinho, provide a specific person to remove from the Starting 11 or keep Lucas on the bench.

Earlier this season he was the best player in turning the game to win 3-2 away to Bayern Münich.


He was a top player for us and though we were all gutted that he left, he did it the right way. In his last game vs West Ham when everyone knew he was leaving he was man of the match and scored a goal. He seems an honest, humble, hard working bloke who wants to go as far as he can in the game and I respect that. Since leaving us he's won another 30-35 caps for England and won 4 trophies. It was a big loss for us but you can't say he made the wrong decision or that he just did it for the money. I'd love to see him back at Villa Park one day but there's no chance of it happening in the near future.

  So, here's the conundrum:  
  
  I have an integrated bathroom unit, which the problem area of which looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/Ra0KPNp.jpg  
  
  The toilet backs onto an integrated unit which means I cannot access the back of the toilet. http://imgur.com/S2zVPmZ  
  
  One of the screws on the bottom of the toilet seat has come off, which means it sometimes comes away from the fittings. I can take the top panel off, but I cannot reach underneath the toilet where the waste pipe goes as this is over a meter drop, and would require extra joints in my arms to appear in order to get to the problem area. Top down view of fittings: imgur.com/a5kocSh  
  
  I cannot get through the bath panel panel either - it's a P shaped bath / shower combo (fancy fancy) http://imgur.com/eyNVR8j - it obviously doesn't cave in towards the bathtub so I can't remove it that way, and I cannot pull it up and out (not even with a couple of hooks underneath, it's fastened on somehow).  
  
  So, I can't get through the bath panel, I can't get behind it - how do I fit a toilet seat?!  
  
  We bought this house back in 2011, the bathroom is extremely high-spec and looks like it cost more thousands than I am willing to sacrifice for a new throne, and I had to dump out around 700 quid for a new Aqualisa shower pump less than 2 months ago.   
  
  I don't want to accidentally wreck the tiling and the I really don't want to have to take everything apart as it's all tight as  fuck down there and I'd never get it all back together again to the same finish.  
  
  So, is there some sort of fitting like a rawl plug type end of screw that I can order in order to just jam a new toilet seat in? That'll mean breaking the other bolt, but I'm sure I can muscle that if I need to.

**Background:** 
  
West Ham were in trouble. It was midway through March, with only 9 games to go and the Hammers found themselves 20th on the table and 10 points from safety. The club had not won a league game since Curbishley’s [first match in charge against Manchester United](http://www.reddit.com/r/Hammers/comments/1sxuic/hammers_history_17th_december_2006_reocoker_goal/). They’d only managed to pick up three points since then (all draws) and, in their last game, had suffered a heart-rending loss to Tottenham after being ahead in the 88th minute.  
  
The situation looked hopeless and only looked like getting worse as they travelled up to Ewood Park. West Ham were facing a Blackburn side safely in the top half of the table and the Hammers had not managed a single away win all season  
  
**Match:**  
  
The first half was a fairly dull affair. Blackburn managed to put the ball in the net through Derbyshire, however it was cancelled out when Bentley was adjudged to have fouled Robert Green. Harewood came close to putting the Hammers ahead with a shot that went just wide of Brad Friedal’s post.   
  
The second half was a different affair. Two minutes after the restart, Christopher Samba rose highest to head Blackburn into the lead.   
  
Zamora replaced Harewood in the 58th minute and the game seemed to shift slightly in West Ham’s favour. None the less, the Hammers were to rely on two huge calls for the game to change around.  
  
The first was a Tevez penalty. After being set free in Blackburn’s final third, the little Argentine darted into the penalty box. But as he tried to cut back inside his foot was caught by Brett Emerton and referee Howard Webb pointed to the spot. Tevez picked himself up to slide the ball past Friedal and equalise for the Irons.  
  
Four minutes later and West Ham were to get a huge stroke of luck. A West Ham corner was headed toward Lee Bowyer, who was standing in front of the ‘Keeper. He flicked the ball toward the corner of the goal where it was blocked on the line. A scramble then started with Tevez missing the ball and the ball flicking up onto Bowyer’s hand and into the path of Bobby Zamora. He struck the ball first time and his shot was blocked on the line by Tevez and bounced away before being cleared by the Blackburn defense. Linesman Jim Devine signalled that it was a goal and West Ham suddenly found themselves 2-1 up, while the officials found themselves subjected to the abuse of Blackburn players and fans alike.  
  
It was a goal that never should have been given:  a hand ball, a player who was offside (Tevez on the goal line) and a ball that didn’t cross the line. For once, it seemed that fortune wasn’t hiding.  
  
Blackburn threw men forward to try to find an equaliser, but they found a surprisingly resolute West Ham defense. When Bentley was sent off for a second bookable offense, the game was all but over. The Hammers fans in attendance screamed in delight as Webb blew for full time and West Ham finally had their first away win of the season.  
  
**Aftermath:**  
  
Blackburn weren’t ultimately affected by the loss and ended up finishing 10th anyway, picking up 4 more wins in their remaining 8 games.
For the second time this season, West Ham followed up a win over Blackburn by immediately winning their next game. The result moved the Hammers up to 19th and gave them a small glimmer of hope that they could still escape the drop, but good results would have to continue if there was to be any hope of that.

Townsend has 4 MOTM awards this season (From this sub) - only Walker and Lloris have more. Lloris and Walker have made 28 and 26 starts respectively while Townsend has only made 11 - making that fact even more impressive.

He also had a strong recent performance vs Cardiff. He did very well in the build up to our goal - he controlled the ball, drove forward and then layed it off perfectly to Ade. When lennon received the ball in a similar position at the end of the same game he drove forward and passed it straight to their CB.

My car was involved in an accident (other driver's fault) and insurers had a local garage collect the car. They said damage was too great and it was a write off. I requested they return the car anyway so I could scrap it for £150 or so. They said they could do that for me with a scrappy they contract with. They quoted a fair price so I said okay. They said I'd need to come and get my things from the car and bring my logbook.

I arrived and collected my stuff. After a while the man from the scrap arrived and asked for my MOT and logbook and gave me a cheque in exchange. I was a bit rushed and just thought that was that. Now I realize I didn't receive any certificate of destruction or anything. Nor did I fill in any part of the logbook or keep a part for myself.

My MOT is up in a weeks' time (one of the reasons scrapping appealed to me).

Can I get in any trouble here if they don't immediately go through and scrap it etc? Am I okay because the garage and insurers suggested these people and I have a cheque from them as some kind of proof I sold it?

I know it seems to be a popular idea at the moment (and perhaps thats just media talk and following the wrong people on twitter) but I really think its wrong.  

1 Last season City won nothing.   This season at a minimum we have the Capital One Cup. 

2 Champions League:  last season City were the worst team in their group.   This year they could have won the group with another goal and I feel did really well against a superior team in Barcelona.  

3 The league:  by this point in the season last year, it was over.  Heck by the time I was drenched and freezing at Loftus Road during that 0-0 draw at the end of January, it was over.   Right now, if we win games in hand, we are in first place in the league (on goal difference... Which, as we know, is all you need!) 

4 Individual performances:  from Nasri to Džeko to Kolarov to Milner.   From Yaya to Aguero:  all of these players have improved their performances from last season.  

5 The big Signings:  I would say all 4 big signings have been or look to be (in the case of Jovetic) very good signings.   The only downside is the little signing of Demichelis. 

6 Harmony:   The players look happy.  They work harder.   They are a team rather than a bunch of rag tag mercenaries.   

7 Man management:  Joe Hart was just simply outstanding against Barcelona.   Yet we all thought he was done.  Pelle handled him magnificently.   He's come back a more serious and professional player.   

8 Youth:  While the impact on the 1st team has been muted, there is no denying that some players have really pushed on.  Lopes, Huws and Rekik should all be squad players within a year or two.   

In summation the problems we have had this season come down more to individual errors, mental breakdowns and injuries.   But these signs have been there for several seasons in the squad - from conceding the lead in the league in 2012 to now.  But these players have either been fixed (Joe Hart) or they are not strong enough for the next stage of growth and will be leaving this summer.  

The goal scoring drought started when all four of our strikers were injured at the same time (as well as Nasri and Fernandinho) and they haven't got their mojo back yet.  I for one think it will return and City will be fighting for the league title right to the last day.

Work: I have a B.A. in anthropology and a Master's in Roman Archeology. I've worked in Retail, food service, and banking, and would be open to long-term stable job in Oxford.

Do you think in hindsight that he should've stayed? I just really don't get it. First of all, he had immense workrate. But I get the impression that everyone on here thinks thats the only thing he has. You can see from a couple of games he played before the loan that he can shoot from outside the box and score. Dembele,, Paulinho, and Bentaleb either don't try this or just aren't good enough at shooting and this makes us very one dimensional. Teams know that we are just going to get it to our wings and try to play into Adebayor because none of our midfielders are going to attempt to shoot. Also he had some creativity, at least more than Paulinho, Dembele, or Bentaleb has now. I think Bentaleb to be honest has the most creativity out of those three, but he is not even close to the ability of Holtby. Holtby would try to split the defense with a pass but now only Eriksen can do that. And when Eriksen isn't playing we lack out bite in the offensive third. Dembele will try to dribble and just pass it to the wing or into Adebayor who has 3 defenders on him.

Is this the way University should be or am I just nit picking? Is this what paying £9000 is meant to be worth? Really interested to hear other peoples opinions about this and if they have had similar experiences!

EDIT:

I don't know if this is relevant but the course is primarily a programming and software type course, so all learning material provided is copied from free tutorial sites etc.

Many of you have mentioned how many of your staff are extremely well skilled in the areas being taught, experts even! With my course here that just doesn't appear to be the case, for one of my subjects the lecturer (having no prior knowledge of the subject) read a book over the summer about the topic, copied majority of the books into lab notes and then attempted to teach us it. It's just so bad. (and of course made no reference to the book)

I think I am definitely going to reach out to someone at the university, preferably not someone on the teaching staff. Eager to completely quit the course and attempt to get a refund on my fees, don't know how likely that is though! 

Thank you all for your comments so far, they are extremely helpful.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Should I expect my university to base their teaching 100% from copy and pasted content from the internet?

Hence why I will probably choose 2 or 3 funds to leave my money in for the medium term while reviewing every few months. 

Based this which is the best S&amp;S ISA for me? key points are;

* £4k initial deposit with regular monthly deposits thereafter  
* Investing in funds only
* Potential to change funds a few times in a year although no regular movement of investment (no day trading).

Should Chelsea try and sign him? I know we've had too many Hulk rumours before but it does seem more likely for this rumour to happen this summer compared to the ones before. I have never seen him play before, except for one game a couple of years ago when he played for Brazil, in which he didn't do very well.  
  
He's 27 years old which means he's approaching his 'prime' age. He's a forward who can also play on the right wing. Probably he could play upfront or behind a main striker. However, I don't know how he'll suit in Mourinho's tactics. It would be great if someone could shine some light on this. Having Lukaku, Hulk and another main striker (hopefully Cavani) should put an end to our problems upfront.  
  
On the flip side, I'm aware he possesses a slightly disruptive behaviour with his occasional outbursts and also he's quite costly being at 40 million. I wouldn't consider him as our main striker buy, but only to replace Torres (if we can dispense him) as a more reliable player.

So I've been out of the casting scene for many a year now, but as my obsession with Dota 2 has increased over the years I've been watching much more e-sports content.

I do see a UK presence lacking in e-sports content however, and this disappoints me. I am also underwhelmed by the professionalism of casts and content on the game. They don't have to be serious all the time, but I feel a little bit more professionalism would go a long way in getting e-sports recognized in the UK, and a lot of us gamers are getting older, and aren't so fond of listening to 16 year old's laugh about female's genitalia (bas example). 

Anyway so I have been talking with a few people, looking to start a British tailored e-sports content delivery channel, with maybe in the future looking at getting high profile events like TI4, broadcasted on live television. We have a number of promising ideas for content, like a weekly review program (much like match of the day for football) showing highlights of the week's high profile games for those who do not have time to watch games all the time. This would be professional grade content, we are talking way above the means of anything I have seen out there. For example more mlg.tv but for england.

What I need to know is, if this is something anybody else would be interested in? And what they would like to see in a new service. Please tell me, I would be much appreciative.

For those interested I have also created a Google form to gauge interest in the idea, as I have to prove to potential backers that there is a market out there for this kind of thing, so if you could take a couple minutes out of your day to fill it out, I would be much appreciated.

Guess I will start with the top of the table game. Luton nicking a point with [Mark Cullens late goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcB371AbMK8). Cambridge had taken the lead earlier through a [poweful Tom Elliot header](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOYimf_1Kkc). 

The worst I have seen Luton play in a long time but despite the U's dominating the possession and territory they really only had the 1 clear cut chance. As you can imagine [John Still was delighted after the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qhikAV8rjg) as was [Mark Cullen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ioOXE0C40). Richard Money [was also pretty reasonable in his post game interview, despite the sycophantic interviewer!!](https://audioboo.fm/boos/1984416-richard-money-after-cambridge-united-v-luton-town-11-03-14) 

The Town inch closer to promotion but will have to wait until Monday night to try to get back to winning ways on BT Sport Vs Woking. 

[Game 2: Alfreton Vs Hyde](http://www.hydefc.co.uk/videos/alfreton-away-11th-march-2014-52421.html)

Hyde finally bit the dust and are relegated to the Conference north, beaten 3-0 by Alfreton. It has been coming for a long while for poor Hyde, who have had a terrible season, often grabbing defeat from the jaws of victory in the final minutes of games. Alfreton further help their play off charge and now rest 3rd, a terrific achievement for a club of their stature.  

[Game 3: Forest Green Vs Salisbury](http://severntv.com/video/00513/131421/index.html) 

Forest Green put 4 past Salisbury, some great strikes combined with some pretty abysmal defending helping them along. Forest Green have a big game against Braintree tonight who both could still make late charges into the play off places, both having games in hand on those above them. 

[Game 4: Kidderminster Harriers Vs Macclesfield Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-hPf2c1n2I)

Just the one highlight from this game but its a good one, a great strike from Callum Gittings. With the Kidderminster managers position finally resolved they are yet another team who could make the play offs. Would have thought that Macc are well out of it now. 

[Game 5: Nuneaton Vs Tamworth](http://www.nuneatontownfc.com/videos/nuneaton-vs-tamworth-highlights-11-03-14-52453.html) 

Nuneaton earn all the points to maintain their play off position with a great strike from Emmitt Delfouneso, another smaller team who are amazingly in the play off places. Tamworth in serious trouble at the bottom still and look a good bet to be relegated. 

Thats all I have for the mid week games I am afraid, the rest of the games I couldnt find any highlights for. 

Braintree will put up highlights eventually [here are the highlights for the weekends match with Hereford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1kgT8baIp80).

So we've got Chelsea at home on Saturday (17:30 GMT). They are obviously looking very strong. We don't have a great record against them in recent times but we did put in a great performance at Stamford Bridge. And Mourinho has never won at Villa Park.


Chelsea played Spurs in their last match. They play Galatasaray on the Tuesday after our game in a tie that is by no means over, before Arsenal on the Saturday after. You would think that if they are going to rest some players it would be against us.


4-1 against Norwich was obviously great for us in the last match, unfortunately the very long break might have prevented us building on that momentum.


Villa have long term absentees - Okore Kozak N'Zogbia Herd - plus Bertrand is ineligible to play against his parent club. I think Gardner is still technically ineligible as well just finishing his loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday but he'll be available after that.


For Chelsea, Torres and Van Ginkel are out while David Luiz and Ashley Cole are doubtful. You could argue that none of those players would feature in their strongest XI right now anyway.


We currently sit 11th in the table. The highest position we could achieve after this round of fixtures is 10th. Worst case scenario, we could be 15th. But Hull would have to beat Man City and Norwich would have to win at Southampton, so I doubt we'll be lower than 13th.


Personally I don't think we'll trouble them. At home to top half teams this season we have Won 1 Drawn 0 and Lost 7. We've failed to score in 5 of those 8 games. The top teams have got wise to our strategy. They don't give us space to counter, don't overcommit and they know that if they can draw us out of our shell that holes will appear and they will score goals. Losing Bertrand is a big blow for this one as it means Clark Bennett or Luna will be facing up to Hazard or another of their fantastic attacking midfielders. Not ideal.


That said, our only real hope of a result is to play a tight game, prevent them from scoring for the first hour or so, hope they get anxious and exploit the counter if they throw too many forward. If we try and attack them Hazard Eto'o and co will just pick us off with ease.


I don't think we should change much in the starting XI. I'd prefer Clark in for Bertrand. I'd stick with Weimann as he is versatile and works hard in defence - maybe Albrighton on after 60 minutes.


My prediction Villa 0-3 Chelsea. Lampard will score.


Hopefully I'm wrong. How do you think this one will plan out? What are your predictions and what would be your preferred line up?

Hello all, I am a longtime NewWho fan. I realize that there are many excellent Doctor Who podcasts out there, however there's always room for one more! 

Would anyone be interested in co-hosting a weekly/semi-weekly (every two weeks) podcast? The length would be about an hour per episode?

The format would be something as follows:

Introduction (ca. 5  min)
    Episode title and date
    Introduction of hosts
     Introduction of guest host
          Ideally every episode we will have a guest host from the fan  
          community to provide a new outlook on the matter and issues

     Episode of the Week Discussion (15-20min)
          Each podcast episode will have an episode from Old Who or 
          NewWho that is watched by the hosts (and listeners 
          hopefully) beforehand and then discussed. Discussion will take 
          place about the episode as a unit, its relation to other 
          episodes like it as well as interesting items and tidbits and the 
          like.
Question of the Week (15-20min)

     Each week we will ask a question to fans and listeners about something Doctor Who related. It could be such items as ‘What kind of Doctor will Capaldi play?’, ‘Favorite/Least favorite companion?’, or going a bit deeper ‘Can we judge the Doctor by our morality?’. ‘Why are the companions usually young, attractive females? Could he have urges and desires long repressed?’

     The hosts will talk about the question and their answer as well as  
     responses from the community. 

Fandom/Outside News (10 min)
     Talk about news from the fandom and show in the intervening 
     week

Next Week’s Episode (ca. 5 min)
     Episode to watch
     Question of the Week
     How to be a guest host
Conclusion (1-2 min)

Two postgrad students, one Psychology PhD (Drew) and one Msc in Middle East Studies and Arabic (Rachael), looking for two (preferably) postgrad students (male or female) to fill two rooms in a beautiful Thirlestane road flat. Located by the Meadows, this flat is about a 15 walk to George Square and there are plenty of shops nearby; groceries, coffee, wine and beer, and pharmacies. 

This third floor flat has a huge common room, a nice bright kitchen, and lots of storage. One bedroom is a single (plus dedicated boxroom) and the other is a double. The single bedroom is still quite a good size, and the boxroom would be available for extra storage for that room. The double is large and both are quiet with nice, sunny views. Rent will average around £420 per month, with utilities being extra. The single room will be let for a bit cheaper. 

The entire flat is furnished and well-kept, no mold or pests. The landlords are very good at responding to any concerns or complaints. 

It will be a twelve month lease (July to July) with the option of staying longer, as Drew will be staying in the flat the following year. 

We both like cooking and going out for the occasional drink or card/boardgame. Rachael loves coffee, white wine, and binge watching Netflix when she isn't busy studying Arabic. Drew studies monkeys and enjoys rock climbing and a good read. We also like to keep things relatively neat and tidy. We'd like to find like-minded students who enjoy the company of others. We don't plan on having wild parties every weekend, but look forward to an occasional get-together. 


We are currently working on the application process for this flat and would like to find to people As Soon As Possible (by the end of this weekend would be awesome) in order to secure it for next year. We would like to meet you before making any final decisions, which is good on all fronts (you can decide if you like us just as much as we can decide if we like you) and talk to you a bit more about the flat and answer any questions you have. PM me  and I will get back to you as quickly as I possibly can.

**Tottenham Starting XI:** Lloris; Walker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Naughton; Lennon, Paulinho, Sandro, Eriksen; Adebayor, Kane. 

**Subs:**Friedel, Fryers, Rose, Bentaleb, Chadli, Townsend, Soldado.

---

**Benfica Starting XI:**  Oblak; Silvio, Luisao, Garay, Siqueira; Amorim, Fejsa, Sulejmani; Markovic, Cardozo, Rodrigo

**Subs:**  Artur, Lima, Almeida, Jardel, Perez, Djuricic, Gaitan

---

**First Half:**

1' Let's get on it

9' Sandro earns a yellow to stop a counter.  

15' Our first good spell of possession ends in a shot from Sandro.  A decent bit of interplay between Elnnon and Eriksen in the right channel leaves Sandro in some space.  Shot from Eriksen's layoff goes high.

18' Little bit of good, old fashioned long ball.  Naughton sends it up to Kane, who nods it down searching for Ade.  Cleared behind for a corner.

30' [**Goal Rodrigo**](http://gfycat.com/EmbarrassedPepperyIvorybilledwoodpecker). Beats Naughton down the right flank to get on the end of a great through ball, opens up and finishes well on Hugo's far post.  

45' **Halftime**

---

**Second Half:**

46' Back at it.

49' Ade should have done better with that.  Surging run from Eriksen, he found Ade just inside the right side of the 18.  Ade had time to set up, but scuffed the shot really, and it went wide.

58' [**Goal Luisao**](http://gfycat.com/UnkemptFearlessAnkole).  Corner sent in, and Kaboul gets picked off, leaving him with a free header.

62' Where the hell has that been all night?  Very good run of play starting with Naughton's turn.  Feeds Kane, who plays a 1-2 with Eriksen.  Gets hacked down outside the box for a dangerous free kick.

63' [**Christian fucking Eriksen!!!!**](http://gfycat.com/SoupyNauticalDegus)  Absolutely inch perfect free kick!  I know you won't believe me, but I already had started typing it out.  You've got to believe!

66' Double sub.  Perez and Gaitan on, Sulejmani and () off.  I missed the second one.

73' Danny Rose and Bobby getting ready on the sideline.  Honestly, don't think either should be coming on right now.

74' Alright, well Hugo just gave me a heart attack. Misjudged that ball over the top but manages to scramble back and paw it away from the charging Benfica player.

75' Soldado replacing Harry Kane.

76' Rose replaces Walker, Naughton to the right.  I like this change a lot.

80' Well, this is fun.  Vert limps off for a moment, and now Naughton goes down under a yellow card challenge from Amorim.

81' Vertonghen gets a yellow for a challenge on Gaitan.  Will miss the second leg.

82' Bentaleb replaces the Beast, who was on a yellow.  

84' **Goal Luisao**.  Gets a bit lucky with Hugo initial save falling right to him, and then his shot cannons off the underside of the bar and in.

**Final Whistle** Benfica take a 3-1 aggregate lead back home.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Match Thread: Tottenham vs. Benfica,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/20c43z/match_thread_tottenham_vs_benfica/

Located by the Meadows, this flat is about a 15 walk to George Square and there are plenty of shops nearby; groceries, coffee, wine and beer, and pharmacies.

This third floor flat has a huge common room, a nice bright kitchen, and lots of storage. One bedroom is a single (plus dedicated boxroom) and the other is a double. The single bedroom is still quite a good size, and the boxroom would be available for extra storage for that room. The double is large and both are quiet with nice, sunny views. Rent will average around £420 per month, with utilities being extra. The single room will be let for a bit cheaper.

The entire flat is furnished and well-kept, no mold or pests. The landlords are very good at responding to any concerns or complaints.

It will be a twelve month lease (July to July) with the option of staying longer, as Drew will be staying in the flat the following year.

We both like cooking and going out for the occasional drink or card/boardgame. Rachael loves coffee, white wine, and binge watching Netflix when she isn't busy studying Arabic. Drew studies monkeys and enjoys rock climbing and a good read. We also like to keep things relatively neat and tidy. We'd like to find like-minded students who enjoy the company of others. We don't plan on having wild parties every weekend, but look forward to an occasional get-together.


We are currently working on the application process for this flat and would like to find to people As Soon As Possible (by the end of this weekend would be awesome) in order to secure it for next year. We would like to meet you before making any final decisions, which is good on all fronts (you can decide if you like us just as much as we can decide if we like you) and talk to you a bit more about the flat and answer any questions you have. We will get back to you as quickly as we possibly can.

It's a nice bike, but I get so many punctures, it's driving me nuts. I've already upgraded to Gatorskin tires, but it didn't help much. Usually when I fix a puncture, I find a little stone splinter or a glass shard that caused it, so it does not seem like I'm suffering from snakebite punctures due to wrong tire pressure. I think these narrow tires are just too flimsy for daily miles on the tow path.

So, I'm looking to replace the bike with something more robust. Here's what I'm looking for:

* The most bullet-proof tires I can find
* Mudgards
* Rack for panniers
* Suitable for attaching a baby seat
* Flat handle bars
* Gears: Derailleur or internal hub (requires less maintenance?). I don't need a lot of gears.

I would be very grateful if /r/londoncycling could recommend such a bike and/or a LBS that sells such robust and practical bikes!

**Update:** I ended up buying a [Cooper Casablanca](http://www.cooperbikes.com/bikes/2/Casablanca). It came with disk brakes, internal gear hub with eight gears and mudguards. I added a rear rack and a kick stand and upgraded the tires to 700x32c Schwalbe Marathon Plus. I addd a Hamax child seat, but haven't tried it out yet.

Kane starting over Soldado after he just regained some confidence?  Naughton on the left (although it seems our options were limited)?

MMR isnt too important but we are all around the 4.5k MMR mark in terms of skill ( lower is fine as one of us has like...3.5k MMR). Knowing what you are doing is of course required as we do not want to have to tell you what to do.

AS i did mention before EURASIAN (malaysian/british) are prefered as we are the Eurasian Potato Invasion. again joking aside, add me up and we will see how things go.

We do play every night and will be looking to set some times to practice properly. 

so add me up and lets get playing :D

I am looking for a gift for a fidgety friend about to start an office job in London.  I have found some great items but all from US based stores and I don't want to send a gift that comes with a import tax bill!  This was my favorite:    http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/playable-metal-car-kit  so I'd love some suggestions of where I could look for something similar from a UK or EU webstore.   
    
   
I wanted to find something classy like in stainless steel or wood, it would be nice if it can be built and taken apart or movable in some way.  Suggestions for other types of new job gifts would be great too though!  Or anything that will be useful in London! 

Thank you!!

Is this the reality of the situation nowadays where Universal Jobmatch seems to be the clearest message of what's available on the UK job market? Recently they've clamped down on scam entries and spam, however that hasn't really solved the problem that there is absolutely nothing there. Just stuff that you apply for to shut the job center up. Who seriously wants any of those jobs listed on the title? Nobody, maybe working in a care home will interest some people, and administrator jobs may be tolerable if you're good at on the phone and have a good memory. But that doesn't matter because most people will only be on the website for years and maybe be asked for less than five interviews a year. I don't think I've even made it to the big five, and I've been on it longer than a year now. 

I'm not just ranting though, I seriously need to know something. Is it even possible to get a job these days without three previous areas of employment in the same thing, or a highly specific qualification in science?

It was a clear cut case of me being at fault and my insurance covered everything without too much drama.

Naturally, having an at fault accident on my record pushes up insurance costs. This isn't such a huge deal in Australia as insurance is pretty cheap. The UK on the other hand is a whole n'other story.

Side-lining the morality of the decision for a second, I was wondering if, instead of ticking the little box to say I've been at fault in the past five years and adding an extra few hundred pounds to my quote I could just, y'know, not do that. It happened on a different continent on the other side of the world and I'm struggling to see how they could possibly trace it back to me. 

How accurate is this assumption? Moreover, what could the consequences be for getting rumbled after an inaccurate car insurance application? I imagine it'd be fairly severe as a disincentive for this kind of thing. But all the same I'm struggling to think of how they would ever possibly know.

Partially because some players want out, mostly because neither of our potential managers next season want much of the current squad. Sherwood obviously is tired of the current squad and prefers growing internal talent (or at least English talent, that knows the club's significance).

LVG on the other hand wouldn't hesitate to clean house entirely. Values homegrown talent and team cohesion more than anything. Team first, individual second. The only people I think are safe are the following:

* Dawson

* Eriksen

* Sandro

* Walker

Other people that might be safe are Townsend, Kaboul, and Dembele. Everyone else will be fair game on the chopping block, some more so than others based on their perceived lack of interest or desire to move on.

I don't think this is a negative post, maybe a fresh start is exactly what either of the managers need to be successful. LVG especially would be exciting, because to say I'm jealous of the kind of loyalty that clubs like United/Barca/Bayern/etc enjoy would be an understatement. Even Southampton is a joy to watch, just because a plurality of the players have grown up playing together.

Does noone else agree that by far the biggest problem is the fact we spent £110m on players last year and gave our young, smart manager less than 6 months to work with them, and it isn't the first time we'eve given managers a huge kitty just to sack them within a few months.

We simply do not stand a chance, I will always support and stand by Spurs till the day I die but I feel like I'm chasing a lost cause with Levy/ENIC at the helm.

Not sure about you guys, you can brag about bringing Ade in all you like, but Sherwood's looked entirely lost. Someone name me a smart tactical move he's made? In the starting 11 or in the form of a sub?

We have NO fluidity or consistency whatsoever under Sherwood, even when we string 2 good wins together they are very far apart in terms of rhythm and lack a general play style (bar maybe the long ball!) Which is hugely concerning to me, and as many people have mentioned, we've seen it all before with Mr Redknapp.

I actually don't hold Tim too accountable, I don't like him personally, and don't think he has what it takes even to give us what we need for the rest of the season, but it is not his fault, he should never in a million years have been given the chance he has at Spurs.

No, this was Levy, and we all know what he was thinking when that happened.....keep cheap and cheerful Sherwood and wait for the best deal.

Levy/ENIC bleed this club dry, they have come close to getting the balance right in the past but continually balls it up generally due to impatience. So why does Timmy and team get so much stick but not Levy?

Just a quick supporting stat for my opinion, we have actually only spent £770k in the last 5 seasons. We do not get ANY investment from ENIC even when it's obvious it could be well used, I appreciate it is a risk to invest without the rewards, but £770k is pitiful. Also, you will not find better situations than one's we have had.

You'll be working on data-driven web applications, helping us to scale as our user base and database size expands greatly over the next few months.
 
If you meet us, you'll hopefully agree that we're on a realistic path to fast growth; we’ve just raised a substantial funding round and our profile is growing quickly. We're a young team but very business focussed, based on Old Street. The atmosphere is fun and friendly, but very motivated: we develop great new features fast and love the feedback and engagement we get from our users.

We’ve hired all our tech staff so far from Reddit with great success, so we’re looking forward to meeting more of you.
  
About you:
  
You'll be a mid to senior level developer; you've got a few years experience and you're looking to take the next step and take on more responsibility.
  
You’ll have skills in some of the following areas, and be keen to learn more:
  
Python
MVC frameworks (we use Pyramid)
SQL (MySQL, currently)
Unix
Amazon Web Services
Nginx / WSGI
Redis
  
As well as being responsible for delivering great new features, you'll be making decisions as to which new technologies we should be adopting and mentoring junior staff members.
 
 What we value most is attitude and adaptability. If you’d like to hear more, get in touch and we’ll take you for a beer. We’re prepared to consider contract / remote working initially, but with a long-term view to your joining our team.

He had already waved 4 fingers to another Portuguese coach (well he actually had a tense rivalry and past with that one). The thing is, Benfica/Tottenham don't have any real rivalry so it was a fucking stupid thing to do.


Benfica have always had classy players and people representing the club, since the Eusébio era onwards and even before. More recently players like Rui Costa as you might remember better.


So please, do not mix our twat manager's stupid reaction with the fans attitude or the club itself. Even tho he is technically representing the club, he has shown several times he does now know how to behave when he wins. 


Related to the incidents in the stands, it's not Benfica supporters fault they're allowed to buy tickets anywhere and I give it to you that it sucks to have mixed fans in the stands.

I'll get the disclaimer out of the way first, it is very unlikely for there to be much chance of an extension, however, that's not to say it's an impossibility...

Okay, I need a developer to take a very simplistic classic ASP based in house developed system and help uplift it to work with a new platform.  
The system itself has not really been touched much in the last seven years and was originally built by someone who wasn't much of a developer (before my time here I hasten to add).  
This system currently queries SQL and displays information on a web page, that's pretty much it, when I said basic, I meant basic.  
The one area of complexity is that the system also uses SSIS to perform an ETL function with data from another database into its own SQL database.  
The source database of this ETL function is going through a transformation programme, and guess what, nobody thought about the systems that interact with the original one and now we find ourselves needing to do some rapid redevelopment.

Sound appealing? (really?, or is it just the day rate you like the look of? I don't care which if you can get the job done).

This is a role with a near immediate start, as in, someone who's available to start by the end of next week.

**Skills:**

* ASP (yes, really, Classic ASP), this is a tiny web app that hasn't had hardly any love in over 7 years
* .net (some of the SSIS requirement will involve .net coding, and maybe redevelop some of the original ASP code base if there's time)
* SSIS (the original DTS packages were redeveloped as SSIS  by myself about a year ago but will now need re-writing again to support the new changes)
* SQL (cross table joins &amp; creating views is about the extent of it, the ability to create pivot table queries would be nice as it would allow some simplification of the code, but that's just a nice to have)

**Skills not required:**

* Infrastructure support, this is purely a development focussed role, we have people to handle the infrastructure side. Sure, if you have skills in this area that's going to help, but it's not required.
* SQL DBA abilities, the same as for the infrastructure side.

**Other things:**  
Not a contractor already, or don't currently have a limited company etc setup and worried about sorting all that in time? That is something I can assist with or work some magic around for the right person.

**Interested?**  
If so then PM me a short message about what experience you have covering everything I've listed above and your email address.

If you don't get a reply from me until over the weekend don't worry, between dashing from meeting to meeting and life outside of work I may put off contacting people back until beer o'clock on Sunday afternoon when I can do things properly without rushing.",false,london_forhire,t5_2sdbo,null,null,self,[Hiring] asp / .net / SQL query / SSIS developer - fixed term (3 months) - £550 p/d - St Paul's,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/20ee5b/hiring_asp_net_sql_query_ssis_developer_fixed/

The fixture arrangers do love to make it difficult for us. At the start of the season Villa vs Chelsea was rearranged because of the Super Cup. Villa sent a list of dates that would be suitable. They were all ignored and the Chelsea game was shoved in between Arsenal and Liverpool during the first week.


As City now only have the Premier League to focus on and that will be their 2nd last game of a very tight title race...I think we can safely mark that down as 0 points.

For those of you who don't know, it is a website for fans of the club to buy and sell tickets at face value. Unfortunately, the club view this as illegal touting, and thus have recently contacted cfctickets to cease the activities happening. This leaves the only viable options to purchase tickets, either buy directly from the club, or from it's official partner, viagogo, (Although obviously you can still sell face-value tickets, but closing down websites like this make it much harder to sell or buy). Now, some of you are probably aware of viagogo, and the huge mark ups that are placed on tickets. Obviously, the club wish to protect it's interests and those of it's partners, thus shall wish to close down any website attempting to make money from tickets sales that aren't viagogo. However, cfctickets are a non-profit organisation. Tickets are sold for face value, and so the website doesn't make any money. The website is paid for by donations. So, are the club really doing the right thing here by closing down a non-profit organisation aiming to assist fans? 

If I was to buy a ticket for a match, realise I can't go, and then sell it on at face-value to a friend, where is the problem? It's such a shame that the club are seeking to close down websites that assist in the sale of face-value priced tickets. 

Should the club really be looking to stop fans from selling on their spares at face-value? Or are they doing the right thing, trying to prevent fraudsters scam fans who're simply interested in watching Chelsea play.

I am looking for just some people to play with in pubs that have a higher skill level and MMR than my own. I want this to improve myself as a player, because at my current MMR it's either a stomp or I/we get complacent and lose. I'm not saying that I win every match at my MMR but it's more biased towards winning. The reason I want somebody with a higher skill level than myself is because I want to better myself as a player. I will try a lot harder in these pubs but I'll also learn how to be a better player due to the higher skill cap and I'll either learn or die, so I learn. That's how it was when I first started playing, I had a lot of friends that played and they were better than me (obviously, because I was new) but now I'm at a similar stage to my friends and I want to get better at the same rate as I did before. I can't see many, if any people wanting to do this because it will be no fun for them, and I know what it's like to play with people who suck. I'm not doing this with an ulterior motive to raise my ranked MMR or anything, I don't care if we play ranked or standard matchmaking, all pick, captains mode, whatever. Anyway, my steam username is jaba305 and my steam name is 'Cap'n'. Just add me if you want to. Thanks.

Info: My party and solo ranked are pretty much the same, about 2700 (laugh at me). I've been told by better players than myself that they're surprised by my score and they expected it to be higher, but whatever, think what you want of that. I have almost 300 wins, I don't remember the exact numbers but I have a few less losses than I do wins. Aight, thanks everybody who reads this.

It's gone from bad (last year) to worse. From the whistle the ""fans"" are on the players backs. People leaving in the before 60 minutes and booing the team. I realise how disappointing it was the last 3 seasons missing out on champions league football but a lot of fucking fans seem to be forgetting how we have been an extremely average team since the premier league began. 8, 15, 7, 8, 10, 14, 11, 10, 14, 9, 10, 14, 9, 5, 5, 11, 8, 4, 5, 4, 5. Those have been our league finishes since 1992. 

These aren't even really the younger fans either. I'm noticing at games it is the older people who are complaining and in general creating a really shit atmosphere. I realise that we as fans have things to complain about; buying 7 players in the summer for example was just mental and we have had some really, really shitty losses this season, but that doesn't give you an excuse to be a twat.

I don't really know what the point I'm try to make is to be honest I just I'm just ranting.

First and foremost, this is not meant to be an optimism or pessimism thread.  I'm hoping for more than just people moaning about how shit were are, or just coming in with supportive comments that don't really *say* anything.

With that said, here are a few points I'm hoping we can discuss.  Feel free to comment with any thoughts you have, of course.

* What do you think our current issues are?  

* What players are under performing, and what reasons do you think there are for that?  

* What can be done in *your* opinion to help them improve?

Dates of them being made at 06.02, 19.02 and 22.02.


I have received two responses from the Daily Mail so far (via PCC).


In first they just rejected my claim and used basis of their article as an *""accurate summary""*. I made a long analysis, pointing to many points which prove otherwise. It was the one where they used ONS's details, when I had ONS's response via e-mail that *""The ONS report was careful to acknowledge that there might be a wide range of factors involved, and did not make simplistic causal explanations of this sort""* (reflecting to the Daily Mail's article).


In DM's second response they basically said the same. Even person from the PCC (when forwarding me that response) already have written that she contacted the Daily Mail to clarify all raised points. I have then found that the Daily Mail at least changed in the article a graph (and it's description), while in the original response they have written ""*We cannot agree that we have published an inaccuracy*"". Dates indicate the response was earlier than the date of the change as published on their website.


On both replies to the PCC the Daily Mail asked for my full name. I have no idea why, unless they wanted to find out if I made a complaint to them first (using my full name) but that is quite stupid or at least not asked in a proper way. Why would they want to know my full name and whether I represent an organisation or not? What does it have to do with an inaccuracy of the article claim I did?

We did not, at any time, knowingly sell tickets to Benfica fans in the home areas of the stadium. Evidence points that is was extremely likely that Benfica supporters based in the UK purchased onlime and through unofficial secondary ticket agents, but many, many Benfica fans were turned away by the Ticket Office both in person and on the telephone long before the fixture. 
 
 
 
Given the large Portuguese community in London and the global appeal of a huge club such as Benfica, the Club were aware that there was a potential that Benfica supporters would acquire tickets in home areas and we increased stewarding and policing accordingly. A number of potentially difficult situations were as a result safely contained by our stewards and by the police. In such situations as we faced last night, it is common practice for safety staff and police to prefer fans inside the stadium than out, hence the reason why the Benfica supporters were allowed in to home areas and to stay there.
 
 
 
All in all, the vast majority of Benfica fans simply wanted to support their team - loudly but non-violently. They tried to secure tickets through any means possible for what was a huge event for Benfica supporters (especially those based in the UK) -something that we are aware that many of our own fans do when travelling abroad. Most fans from both sides behaved impeccably and many fans reported what a great night thy had had, swapping shirts and caps at the end of the evening.
 
 
 
We are sorry for any inconvenience or distress caused for home supporters and we would like to thank the many Spurs fans whose patience, tolerance and calm behaviour helped our stewards and the Police to ensure that the evening passed off safely and enjoyably for the vast majority of supporters from both sides.

i messaged them on facebook to see what difference between the two, and they said for the extra price you get USD forks twin discs on front, the engine is liquid cooled instead of air cooled, alloy wheels, braided brake lines

i know they won't hold there value but i don't fancy diving into the secondhand world.

mainly looking for a review on how reliable they are and also if you would think paying the £500 more for the above is worth it. 

i'm not a chav looking to thrash it, never change the oil, go offroad, not clean it and generally not look after it.

after all i will be paying for it for myself and don't want to throw my money down the drain

this has some better pictures of it http://www.gumtree.com/p/cars-vans-motorbikes/2014-wk-sp125n-125cc-motorbike-2-year-warranty-finance-available-brand-new/1049504428#photo-content

maybe a stupid question since i'm on the intenet but i can't really understand it, but what are ""braided brake lines"" and what do they do?

Like other young women working at the Waterbury Clock Company in the 1920s, Mae Keane was taught a specific technique for applying paint to the numbers on wristwatch dials: Put the tip of the tiny brush between your lips to shape the bristles into the finest of points.

It was not regular paint. It was made with a relatively new material that most people did not know much about, something called radium. Watchmakers liked it because it glowed in the dark. Later, it became clear that it killed.

Had Mrs. Keane stayed longer, she might have become one of the many sad stories involving the so-called radium girls, the hundreds of young women who worked with radium paint in factories early in the 20th century. Many were still in their 20s when they died of cancer from radiation poisoning. Others succumbed later, and to other health problems related to radium exposure. Many lost their teeth; some also lost their jawbones. They did not necessarily know why.

But Mrs. Keane did not like the taste and texture of the paint or the tedium of the work. She was not very good at it, either. Her bosses were not impressed. After a few months, she was gone. It was the summer of 1924. She was 18. Within two decades she had lost all her teeth.

Yet Mrs. Keane was a survivor who later conquered colon and breast cancer. She was 107 when she died on March 1 in Middlebury, Conn., perhaps the last living participant in a particularly dark moment in American industrial history.

By the end of the 1920s, dozens of women had died in plants in Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey. The dangers of radium were becoming more widely understood. New federal safeguards were put in place, in part under pressure from dial painters who worked together to demand compensation and better protection. The practice of “lip pointing” was stopped.

Decades later, scientists dug up bones of the dead and found they were radioactive. Books, poems and at least one play have been written and documentary films have been made about the radium girls. Many years after the Waterbury Watch Company closed, radiation was still present at the site.

“She didn’t know it was bad for her,” Mrs. Keane’s niece Patricia Cohn, who confirmed the death, said in an interview. “She said it was gritty, and she didn’t like putting it into her mouth.”...

Painting watch dials was promoted as ideally suited for delicate female hands. Mrs. Keane had expected it to be easy work, and the pay was good: a few cents for each dial she completed.

“We were young,” she told The Hartford Courant in 2004. “We didn’t know anything about the paint.”",false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,null,null,default,"Those who recall a *QI* discussion about the ""radium girls"" of the 1920s who contracted radiation poisoning from their job of painting radium numerals on wristwatches might enjoy this obit of one who beat the odds, having just died at age 107.",92,http://www.reddit.com/r/quiteinteresting/comments/20ff86/those_who_recall_a_qi_discussion_about_the_radium/

Jump to today, net has gone down for the fourth time this week, so we phone sky. First problem, no account details as sky has not sent anything (at all). The guy on the other end first refuses to give me my account details (and never does) and just says the change over from O2 is happening today, the net should be back by midnight. General attitude of go fuck yourself really. So nine hours later, this rant..

I just laugh because this is ridiculous. Net never came back on, service status for sky is fine, can't find anything on a switchover today and was under the impression it had already happened. I find out that this exact scenario played out a couple of months back with my brother. He phones to tell them that he will be switching over and is left for 2 weeks immediately without net. They don't continue to the end of the month or switchover like a normal fucking company, nope, they switch you off immediately. 

My impressions of today is that not only did this guy all out lie, but that the general attitude towards former O2 customers is dire. Wtf is going on here? I'll be phoning sky tomorrow, but I get the impression that they are an even shittier company than I originally thought and will lie through their teeth. This is a very distasteful way of running an ISP.

I can imagine we are not the only people this has happened to, anyone else out there (if they have net)?

EDIT Everything working again! Got an email to another family member saying it was back up at 3am, it wasn't. Today, a phone call at 4.30pm from a really great guy who sorted it out in 5 minutes.
