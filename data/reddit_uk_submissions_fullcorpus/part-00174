I have a friend with a broken leg, who has a dog called Dave, who needs to be walked. I went for a run with Dave this morning. Two birds, one stone, qu'est-ce que *say* Rodney.

I have a feeling there are other slightly bulky people like myself who *really really honestly* intended to go for a run before work this morning, and told their SOs last night that they would, and genuinely meant it... several times, over the last few weeks. And our running shoes are still in the box we bought them in. In the morning we'll be really tired and need that extra half hour in bed, but we'll *definitely go tomorrow*. We promise.

We won't though. Just like yesterday.

If my own health is my only motivation to go running, I won't go. I'll have a sore foot or a blister or a rash or something else pathetic. But if I've agreed to jog with someone's dog, I'm not going to let them down. My slacking has limits, and letting a dog down is crossing the line. 

So, somebody tell me that this idea isn't bonkers. Help me make this site(I'm a programmer, but I stay well away from web development. I'm all about writing OpenGL/ES drivers for GPUs you've never heard of and if you like gaming, will never use)

I want a website where I say ""I want to go for a 3 mile run in X town every Tuesday and Thursday"" and I get matched up with a middle aged woman who can't keep up with her dalmatian these days. her dog will motivate me to follow through on the promises I can't currently keep to myself.

I know that letting agencies won't sign up contracts unless you are there to view the flat in person, but is the same case with a private landlord? 

Now, suppose I do agree with him/her to do the paperwork via email correspondence. How can I make sure my deposit (and probably also the first month rent) will not be lost? That is, that I don't get caught in a fraud (I am afraid of the following scenario: I make a bank transfer to some account that he indicates to me, and then when I arrive there he will deny our previous arrangements and refuse to return what I paid). I somewhere saw a link to ""mydepositsscotland"" but I really have a hard time understanding the idea behind it (seems like the landlord does all the stuff after I pay the deposit, but how do I make sure he sticks to his word and makes the required paperwork). In my view, it should be that the owner initiates the process and commits that if I pay the deposit by his specified time he locks the transaction and there is no way back. This way he can't deny that I made the deposit in case I respect his terms. But, by doing the deposit and trusting that he will do the registration of the deposit at a later time seems pointless. 

It's very frustrating that there is this policy of having to be in person, and the solution of renting something temporarily seems very costly in the month of August. What a market is there for people looking to make profit out of short-term lettings: students looking for places for the new academic year and festival fans and tourists doing their trips!! And from what I read in a previous post, there are cases when the owner, gets you out of the apartment so that he could rent for 3x, 4x the price a long-term tenant pays. Horrible! 

I am used to some stressful things and people running around in the busiest part of Los Angeles, but there you kind of have pretty good control when you are looking to rent a place. In Edinburgh it seems a different world with a new set of customs. You need to go through a month of hustle and figuring it out, for a stay of 9, 10 months. It's a ridiculous waste of time. I start to not like it because of this.

I'm not British (yet) so I can say without a doubt you guys should reject any moves to dismantle this institution.

Australia has a good healthcare system but to me, even with private health insurance it just felt broken or disjointed. 

Going to see a doctor to get a referral to get an ultrasound to then go back to the doctor for the results is not only expensive but also the cause of missed opportunities to defect issues (in our case) my partner was not given a test that would have warned us of the high likelihood of a premature baby. The test was never preformed and only sitting in the labour ward was it noticed by NHS staff. 

I'm sure there are good and bad stories for each system but in my case personally and now with our baby I can say without a doubt that the NHS far outperforms the Australian private system.

I am a Canadian citizen, and was in the UK on a 2 year tier 5 visa.
Last August, I was caught by a speed camera outside of Southampton (35mph in a 30 zone.) I was driving my British girlfriend's car, on which I was insured. They sent her a letter requesting details of the driver, which she returned with my details, saying I was driving. I then received the same letter, and returned it with my details saying I was driving. 
I assume they never received this one, as the next I heard from them was a court summons for failing to provide information. It said that they had sent two further requests for information, which I never received.
I unfortunately missed the court date, as it had frankly slipped my mind, being 6 months after the summons, and shortly before my visa expired and I left the UK. (I am currently back as a tourist, but am returning to Canada permanently in August) I understand this is 100% my fault. 
I have recently received a letter saying the speeding charge has been dropped, and the fine for failing to provide information is over £700. This is frustrating, as I have provided the information twice. I don't have the money to pay the fine, and won't until I get home and start working again. I also unfortunately don't have proof that I sent the letters with my details.
Basically, what are my options? Is it any longer possible to get the fine reduced back to speeding?
Will they pursue this back to Canada if I just don't pay, and will that affect any chances of me getting back in to the UK? I'd prefer not to just ignore it, but I'd also prefer not to have to pay the equivalent of a month's wage for something I'm not guilty of.
Sorry for the wall of text, and sorry for any typos, I'm writing this on my phone.

@Andrew_Heaton: If we hadn't seen such riches, we could live with being poor. Goodnight all.



Now there has been speculation that it has something to do with James since ""If we hadn't seen such riches, we could live with being poor"" is  a lyric from a song by a band called James. Seems legit.


But let's go deeper. James are a ""Madchester"" band from Manchester and that quote has recently been used to describe the failures of Man U. See [this](http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/07/if-manchester-united-fans-hadnt-seen-such-riches-they-could-live-with-being-poor-4221886/). The quote seems to be associated with United.


Now this can only mean one thing. We're fucking over Man U in some way. Manchester are going to be mad, Madchester. Pogba coming? Man U missing out on Vidal and we get him? Rodgers banging Shrek's wife? Discuss.

Recently we've had some tournaments over in the UK scene and it's a lot of fun to watch (Cheering on my player at E.13, come on DD!) I thought that I would have my hand at hosting a tournament.

Obviously it would be a 1v1 tournament as it said above, and it would play out like the popularized tournament ""A fistful of Tangoes"" however with a few slight differences. I'll explain the proposed rules below:

* Bottle and Runes are **allowed**.
* Bottle Crowing is **not allowed**.
* Soul ring is **not allowed**.
* First to **two kills** or **two towers**.
* Both players select three heroes of their choice **privately**, those heroes would then be randomized into three matchups.
* The players would then be able to veto one matchup **privately**. With the non-vetoed matchup being played, or in the case of the same matchup vetoed that would be played instead.
* The heroes players pick as their 3 chosen heroes, they ***can not*** pick again for the rest of the tournament.
* All games would be a **best of 3**
* It would be a **double elimination** tournament
* Players would play on both sides, and with both heroes on the chosen matchup.
* If it goes to a third game, **Shadow Fiend vs Shadow Fiend** is what would be played.
* You play for pride of being the best 1v1'er in the UK.
* Start date would be around mid-august with games being played mid week &amp; on weekends around 8PM GMT

This would allow for some goofy matchups to be played, and really test the limits of some players with their hero pool getting smaller as the tournament goes on. The only problem is I don't know if the interest is there for such a tournament. We would need players, casters and possibly a secondary admin to help me out. A ideal scenario would be getting at least 16 players, preferably more. If there is any interest in this I will be back in a few days with official signup links. As for now, 
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1esN3EtnzttvnOQhvXZJKDR9qJ_jp34GjXG1Z8h-0-ug/viewform?usp=send_form) is a Google Document where you can just fill out a few details so I know you have interest and you can address any concerns there. The odds are I would have missed a rule or two that makes this tournament impractical, or I didn't explain something great. If you missed it, I'll throw the form below again. Thanks for reading this.

I didn't know if anyone was doing a proper thread for this, so I figured I'd throw one together quickly. Nowt special, as I can't be arsed. Anyone going down today?

Notable inclusions/exclusions: Ex-Leeds players Ben Parker and Gavin Rothery both start for Guiseley, while Leeds include Ross Killock, Zac Thompson, Charlie Taylor and Lewis Cook in the starting XI. Doukara and Morison start up top for the Whites, with the previously-thought-missing David Norris just behind them. Aidy White will play in midfield again for the final 30 minutes, along with Noel Hunt who sits behind Matt Smith and Lewis Walters. Dom Poleon and Chris Dawson are both with the U-21s at Garforth today, will they be getting a look-in this season? No Paddy Kenny either, surely his days are numbered?

**STARTING XIs**

***Guiseley***

Drench, Holdsworth, Parker, Lowe, Hall, Lawlor, Brooksby, Stockdill, Boyes, Forrest, Rothery

***Leeds*** (First 60 mins)

Silvestri, Thompson, Lees, Killock, C Taylor, Cook, Tonge, Bianchi, Norris, Morison, Doukara

(Last 30 mins)

S Taylor, Byram, Wootton, Pearce, Warnock, Austin, Murphy, White, Hunt, Walters, Smith

**[LIVE COMMENTARY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz73X9h8aRQ)**

* 13 - Morison heads into the side netting from a C Taylor cross
* 22 - Danny Forrest fires just over the bar after good work from Rothery &amp; Boyes
* 29 - Fantastic save from Drench, pushing away a fierce drive from Bianchi
* 35 - Thompson drives at the Guiseley box, finding Tonge who shoots over from 18 yards 

***H/T - A bit cagey really, typical pre-season friendly. Rothery, Forrest and Drench have impressed for Guiseley, while by all accounts David Norris has been our best player. Doukara, Taylor and Cook have all been lively, and hopefully we'll get a bit more expression in the second half.***

* 48 - Good work again from Forrest who finds Lawlor in the box, but his effort goes wide. Should have scored.
* 55 - Thompson off for Byram 
* 56 - Rothery forces a save out of Silvestri. Leeds struggling in this second half. 
* 59 - HERE COME THE SUBS - The remaining 10 subs take their places for the final 30 minutes.
* 61 - Aidy White's cross hits the arm of Toulson... No penalty says the ref. 
* 75 - Nothing really happening at the minute... Aidy White and Lewis Walters have both had shots blocked.  
* **85 - GOAL: Jason Pearce heads in from a White corner. 0-1.**
* 89 - **GOAL: Matt Smith taps in after Murphy plays a lovely ball down the right for Sam Byram, who crosses for the big man. 0-2** 

**F/T - A very quiet second half is wrapped up with two late goals from Leeds. Pearce from an Aidy White corner, and then a Matt Smith tap in right at the death. A tougher challenge on Tuesday at Mansfield will say more about the strengths of this squad than this game has.**",false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,null,null,self,Match Thread? Match Thread.

Line-up:

B Jones, Kelly, Flanagan, Skrtel (c), Wisdom, Lucas, Allen, Can, Coutinho, Lambert, Borini

Subs: Ward, Smith, Enrique, Coady, Coates, Phillips, Robinson, Stewart, L Jones, Peterson, Suso, Rossiter, Ibe, Adorjan

Shitty Commentary:

6': 1st shot goes to Preston. From about 25 yards out, didn't even ruffle Brad's hair.

10': Borini nearly slipped in behind the defense, keeper came out well.

14': Another Preston chance- deflected off Wisdom, but goal kick given.

17': The Can-man looking like good so far. Been very tidy in the middle.

18': Decent save from Jones, tips it behind for a corner. Brownhill(?) gets a free header from it, but puts it wide.

SUBSTITUTION 21': Can going off for Ibe. Looks like Can took a bit of a knock, and Rodgers didn't want to take a chance.

24': Skertl gets his head to a corner, blocked in front of goal.

28': Nice play from Ibe, the ball eventually finds its way to Lambert, who hits it 1st time. Right at the keeper unfortunately.

30': INJURY UPDATE- Can has a slight calf strain apparently. Hopefully nothing to serious.

33': Coutinho makes a rare mistake, Garner gets a chance and hits it right down the keepers throat.

34': If Ibe could finish he would be amazing.

36': Lambert drops back a bit to pick up the ball and plays a great pass through to Allen, who was offside.

43': Allen intercepts deep in his own half and plays a great ball to release Borini down the left. Borini tries to find Lambert in the box, but not enough pace on the cross.

45': Nice link up play from the Preston strikers, well defended by wisdom to kill the chance.

45'+1: [GOAL](http://gfycat.com/ShamefulCourteousHound) (/u/FredSports - Love you Fred)- PNE 1-0 LFC Corner comes into the back post, acrobatic attempt well saved, but it falls to a Preston player for a 1 yard tap in.

HALF TIME

In other sporting news today, Rory McIlroy finishes the 3rd day of the open with a round of 68, putting him 16 under for the tournament. He will take a 6 shot lead into the final day.

Half time Subs:

Suso &gt; Lambert

Robinson &gt; Kelly (Flanno to Rb)

48': Suso and Flanno linking up down the right nicely so far, until Suso was body checked off the ball.

50': Well, Kevin Davies is on for the 2nd half, so don't surprised if Can isn't the only injury today.

57': Suso feeds it to Coutinho in the box for a half chance. Snuffed out for the defender. Jesus this has been a boring half so far.

59': Skrtel uses an arm-lock take down to ground his opponent, who manages to break the hold before he has to tap out.

61': Holy shit! there was a shot!? Suso cuts in from the right, and hits it with his left. Comfortable take from the keeper.

62': Apparently a lot of subs warming up, hopefully spice things up a bit.

63': SUBS ON:

Adorjan

Coady 

Peterson

Coates

Jones

Rossiter

SUBS OFF:

Coutinho

Lucas

Borini

Skrtel

Wisdom

Flanno

Allen

65': Ibe with a powerful run, and a decent shot for once. Deflected over for a corner.

70': SUB- Enrique &gt; Robinson.

74': [GOAL!](http://gfycat.com/SomberLeafyAmericanwirehair)(/u/FredSports) 1-1 Great run from Ibe, lays it off to Suso, who has a great finish into the top corner

77': [GOAL!](http://gfycat.com/VastSinfulGiraffe)(/u/FredSports)Jordan Ibe cuts the ball back from the by-line to Peterson, who has a shot from about 8 yards, takes a deflection and goes in.

83': SUB- Phillips &gt; Adorjan

85': Ibe's cross/shot forces a good save from the Preston keeper.

88': Peterson has a good break away, Coady takes it off his toes and finishes the move with a poor shot.

I've been reading through MSEs pension page, but can't find anything that relates to holding multiple pensions from different jobs.

I keep spending time travelling outside of the UK so have no fixed employment field or career, just taking basic easy to get work to support myself wherever I happen to be.

I'm now of the age to be thinking about pensions but have some questions about taking a personal vs. employer pension.  If I opt-in to an employer pension each time what happens when I leave and start another job?  Can it be moved and added to the new pot?  If not how is it affected by having multiple smaller ones?  Is a private one paid into consistently a better or worse option than this?

Does anyone have any knowledge, or a good guide, to looking into this?

Tottenham are stateside today for the first of 3 pre-season friendlies in America. 

Seattle has some quality players like DeAndre Yedlin, Obafemi Martins, and of course former Spur Clint Dempsey. Seattle will also have the advantage in that they are in mid-season form while we just flew thousands of miles, went back a few timezones, and have only had a few days to adjust for the game.

What does everybody want to see in today's match?
I'm looking forward to see Lamela in a semi-competitive atmosphere, it's been so long since we have.

I am a 27/f Canadian looking to move to the UK.  I'm going to visit in September, for a month.  I'm visiting a few different cities to see how I feel about living there.  Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield are booked.  But I have a few days where I could visit either Leeds or Nottingham.  Which city would be a better choice for me to visit?  Which city is more 'liveable'?  I like living in areas with some access to nature (parks and hiking trails, mostly) but that still has some nightlife going on.  Theatres, nice restaurants, non-seedy pubs, that sort of thing.  Nothing too crazy.

I've recently started working my first proper office job, Monday through Friday, 9 to 5, and I'm a British citizen, with a British Passport and Driver's License... On my second day at work, whilst filling out my personal banking details for work, one of the questions was ""What's your NINO/National Insurance No?""... Well I don't know..

So I give it a Google about. HMRC says, fill in this online form and we'll tell you; you fill in the online form, and it tells you this online service is no longer available, so please phone instead, and at the end of the call, you get told this service is no longer available, so please post the form I initially filled in to the nearest HMRC address. 

Except the Royal Mail PO is generally open, 9 to 5, the exact same time I work, but luckily got my letter into the last collection of the day. Two weeks on, and I've not received any response back from HMRC as to what my NINO is. So I phone up their support number, 15 minutes waiting, and no response but the damn waiting tune. Time is going on, and payday is getting closer.

So where else can I turn to? The JobCentre Plus ofcourse! They tell me I can register for a NINO there... between the hours of 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, Closed Saturdays. Great, that'll be 1 lunch gone to make an appointment, and then another lunch gone to have to prove to someone I'm British Born Citizen, and then 2 weeks later hopefully get a NINO. (This is my plan come this Monday...)

But in the mean time, I'm wondering if the council can help me any way, so I go to my local Citizens Advice Bureau... closed Saturdays, Open Monday through Friday. And the Civic Centre too, again.


 Love Britain.

Sometime around this Tuesday (the 15th), John White showed up at his aunt's in Cambridge (She lives on Enniskillen road).  He is not well.  He has some issues with addictions and it has effected his mental health quite a bit.  Now his family and I are trying to find him.  He hasn't been by his Aunt's place in the last two days.  His Aunt is holding onto his passport, so he is most likely in the local area.

I don't have many recent photos, but here are a few images 

http://imgur.com/a/gafmB
I imagine his hair will be a bit long and quite curly at this point, and he will probably look somewhat unkempt / scruffy.

* Name: John White
* Height: 5' 10"" (1.7 M)
* weight: 120 lbs (54 kg)




He's probably going through heavy withdrawals and might be confused or unstable.  If you see him around, please let him know his family is worried for him and would like to talk to him.


UPDATE (As of Monday, July 20th)
John finally showed up at his aunts place.  He lost the last of his money and his cellphone, and got into an argument with his aunt and ended up leaving.  Thank you to anyone who was looking out for him.  Hopefuly he finds a way home, or at least find a place to stay.

It's a good chip, [pretty numbers here](http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-3770K+%40+3.50GHz&amp;id=2) show that it's still strong as hell and should last a good few years. Just wish it came with vt-d/vt-x so I wouldn't need to swap the bloody thing!

If someone's got a spare H220 I might be interested in hardwareswap, otherwise I just need money to help fund the computer habit.

I'm Northampton based and happy to swap fat stacks of cash if that's your thing, otherwise I'll just parcel2go up a courier with some insurance on once paypal says I've got funds.

FUCK A /R/SOCCER MATCH THREAD


Lineups:

**Seattle**: Frei, Yedlin, Marshall, Scott, Anibaba, Neagle, Alonso, Pineda, Pappa, Martins, Dempsey.
Seattle Subs: Remick, Bowen, Pereira, Weaver, Long, Traore, Barrett, Estrada, Okoli, Ford, Cooper, Azira, Kovar

**Tottenham**: Friedel, Naughton, Dawson, Fryers, Rose, Carroll, Holtby, Capoue, Townsend, Kane, Lennon.
Tottenham Subs: McGee, Fredericks, Kaboul, Veljkovic, Walker, Ceballos, Eriksen, Falque, Lamela, Mason, Soldado

**FIRST HALF**
KICK OFF
-Amazing moment for Xander Bailey, too bad he's an Arsenal fan!!

1': AND WE'RE UNDERWAY COYS
Marco Pappa gets a rip in and almost scores, conceding early would've been hilariously ironic.

6': There have been some rusty legs out there. Some late tackles too, most of the game is being played in our end.

9': **GOOOOOAAAAALLLL 1-0 TOTTENHAM** [GIF-AFY ME CAPTAIN](http://gfycat.com/DecentNaughtyKookaburra) Harry Kane clips a ball beautifully for **Lewis Holtby** who splits two defenders and heads the ball into the net! Great start and a sexy combination from Holtby and the Hurricane.

12': Chance for Dempsey and Seattle. Clint easily beats Kyle Naughton in the air but heads it just wide of the far post. As a Tottenham and New England Revolution fan I miss you Clint.

15' Obafemi should've done better. Was in all alone but got the ball caught under his feat. Surprise surprise our defense looks bad.

16' Naughton thinks he's Bale for a second. Cuts in on his left and hits it low to the keeper. Coming the other way Ol' Man Friedel makes a save on Dempsey who found his way past our back-line...not a tough thing to do.

17' Nice combination from the Sounders. Obafemi puts it over. Dawson having a rough go out there early.

19' Back-to-back chances for Seattle that are ruled offside. Both seem to have been wrongly ruled and we're getting lucky. Another bad giveaway from Dawson set up the last chance.

21' Danny Rose down the left hand side but smacks the ball right at Stefan Fry

24' Freekick to Spurs after Holtby is cut down. Dempsey doesn't like the call.  The resulting kick is off the wall and cleared.

25' I need to run to my car and grab water/weed/a bag of pretzels. Hopefully won't miss more than 5 minutes.

30' Back at it, appears nothing happened, but there was a homeless guy rummaging for cans in my trash can. I've seen him before but the eye contact we made was still awkward. We've got a free kick...Holtby to take...Poor ball cleared by an early defender.

31' Another mistake from Michael Dawson leads to a foul from Lennon to give Seattle a freekick which Dempsey hits off the wall for a corner. Poch can't be impressed with our defenders early performance.

33' **Penalty to Seattle** Michael Dawson goes high on Chad Marshall on a corner kick. Resulting penalty is panenka'd in by **Pineda GOAL SEATTLE 1-1 TOTTENHAM**.

37' Kyle Naughton is hurt and is Naughton the game. http://thedissectedfrog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/daduntsh.gif?w=687&amp;h=381

40' Oba and Clint combining well once again. Dempsey got a shot off that Rose cleared, might not have been going in. The corner is headed and tipped over by Friedel for another corner, which is headed over by Marshall for a goal kick.

44' *Every Rose Has It's Thorn*

[ITS HALFTIME](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbq3axLwamE)

**SECOND HALF**

46' **SUBSTITUTIONS**: Veljkovic, Fredericks, Ceballos, Kaboul, SOLDADO, and **LAMELA** are on for Dawson, Kane, Lennon, Naughton, Rose, and Townsend.

49' **GOAL SEATTLE 2-1 TOTTENHAM** **Osvaldo Alonso** scores a cracker off the crossbar and in. I was counting all the subs and missed it...

54' Amazing first touch from **Roberto Soldado**. He cuts in on Chad Marshall and gets knocked over from behind.  Then the PK is rolled in by Bobby! **GOAL TOTTENHAM 2-2 SEATTLE**

58' A chance almost falls for Lamela who skuffs it towards the keeper. Seattle break through Obafemi, but he's thwarted and the ball is cleared.

62' **SEATTLE SUBSTITUTION** Oba and Marshall off...Traore, Cooper on


**TOTTENHAM SUBSTITUTION** Ryan Mason on for Etienne Capoue

65' Soldado knocks it to Lamela but it's not the best angle as his shot is saved. Erik looks bright so far!!

67' Yedlin goes down the right and sends in a nice ball for Kenny Cooper who heads over. 

69' **TOTTENHAM SUBSTITUTION** Iago Falque is coming on for Lewis Holtby
What if Falque just secretly became a superstar? I feel like we haven't seen him in a while

71' Lamela with some nice touches drives forward and gets hacked down and draws a yellow card on Matt Scott. Resulting Tottenham freekick is hit into the wall by Lamela.

73' Lamela apparently needed to be treated by the physios after that last tackle? Probably nothing but it's always worrying.

**SEATTLE SUBSTITUTION** Clint Dempsey comes off and receives a nice ovation. He's replaced by Okoli and Kovar came on for Pappa

76' Fredericks drives to the end line and crosses into Soldado who heads it on for Falque. Iago is unlucky to head it over the bar.

78' **SEATTLE SUBSTITUTION** Frei the goalie comes out for backup Josh Ford. And Tristan Bowen comes on for Lamar Neagle

79' **GOAL SEATTLE 3-2** Seattle have numbers down the left flank and Okoli sends in a great cross that finds Tristan Bowen at the far post who easily taps home.  

81' **GOALLLLLL TOTTENHAM 3-3!!!** **IAGO FALQUE** earns a penalty after he chips a ball off of Yedlin's arm. There was a nutmeg in there somewhere, then after earning the PK Iago calmly slots it to the right to equalize!!!!

**DID OR DID I NOT JUST CALL IAGO FALQUE BEING A SUPERSTAR??? WE DON'T NEED GRIEZMANN!!!**

86' Amazing combination from the Spaniards Ceballos and Soldado. Ceballos' shot is right at Ford who knocks it away, Ceballos picks up a yellow fighting to win it back.

88' Tempers are flaring as Traore appeared to go after Lamela after Soldado and Alonso got into it. Younes Kaboul  does his job and defends Lamela. Alonso has always been a douchebag and he's earned a yellow for it here, along with Soldado.

**FULL TIME TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 3 -SEATTLE SOUNDERS 3** Only one-minute of stoppage time and we're done after a corner biked over by Traore. Really entertaining display with some shoddy defending and a few bright spots. I'm just happy to be back watching Spurs with the Yid Army we have on /r/coys.

For some reason the stickied picnic/pub meetup thread is disappearing for some people. I can see it just fine, but at least half a dozen people have told me it's gone, so I'm not sure what is happening there. xD


Latest word on the weather tomorrow seems to be that nobody has a clue what it is doing. Some places say cloudy, others wet, others fine, so I don't know. 


To be on the safe side, lets meet at **[The Anchor at 2pm](http://www.metropolitanpubcompany.com/our-pubs/the-anchor/)** and take it from there. I will bring blankets, and so if the weather is nice we can go on to the Mill Pond after we've had a drink or two. 


With regards to picnic food, if you want to trust the weather, bring some with you, but if not then we can make a trip to town to buy stuff from M&amp;S or somewhere when we decide to move from the pub.


I will bring flags once again so that we can be easily found in the pub. If we move outside I'll update this thread with our location, but it will be somewhere near the pub and easy to spot from the path.


Hope to see loads of you there!


Oh god I forgot the flags. Um. Right, will try and make signs somehow.


Okay, got some signs and got a table (502, down the stairs and on the right) with plenty of space just opposite the bar. It's looking really nice outside, though, so we might still be able to pic the nic yet!


We have moved to the Mill Pond! We are on two picnic blankets under the big weeping willow right opposite The Mill pub!

The filming all took place around St Paul's cathedral in London. I didn't want to hang around all day so I returned in between various things. I didn't see the filming they did on or near the Millenium bridge, only the stuff near the cathedral.

* The first scene they filmed was the doctor running down from St Pauls towards the Thames, frantically shouting at people to run away. He runs past Michelle Gomez dressed in Victorian clothing (as per [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/articles/Michelle-Gomez-to-star-in-Doctor-Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/articles/Michelle-Gomez-to-star-in-Doctor-Who)) who isn't at all phased. They converse.
* I returned an hour later and now they had the cybermen out, walking down from St Pauls in the same direction the Doctor had previously ran, but during this all the extras were clapping. The cybermen come to a halt and everyone takes selfies and poses for photos with them. Michelle Gomez said something along the lines of ""well done boys"" and pulled something from her hat. I took it that she was controlling them.
* I returned 3 hours after that, around 6.30ish to see them on the steps of St Pauls. The doctor runs out of the main door looking worried, where Gomez calmly joins them. The doctor looks up into the sky looking worried/intense. Again Gomez is quite calm.

The security guys were the ones saying that it was for the finale, but it would also make sense that the last piece of filming they have to do is outside-Cardiff location shots for the last episode of the series, they'll have to deliver it very soon. One security guy also said that in other scenes London has been taken over by forestry, with trees everywhere. It sounds far-fetched, I'm just relaying it, I didn't really believe him at the time.

It was great to see them filming anyway, I thought Peter Capaldi looked great in his costume, if a little hipster with the buttoned up shirt and jacket combo. He was a real gentleman with everyone as well. Michelle Gomez was great too, she hissed at the crowd when we were all waving to her.

I'm moving to Belfast next month. It's come out of the blue. Looking for advice one decent places to live. I'm trying to avoid student areas due to noise etc.

I've looked at the Titanic Quarter - is it at all anti-social? 

Where would you suggest? Budget for rent is max £2000 a month

Any advice appreciated

Thanks

Joe

Clara entered our mind-set as a plot point in an Amy/Rory story. She was introduced as a point in a story that was HUGELY centred on Amy and Rory. (SPOILERS) Their reconciliation. She was intregal to the story but it was never *her* story.

Fast forward 2 years. I still hold less emotional attachment to Clara than I did to Martha, (*And that's saying something*). Clara was forced on us. She entered as a plot point and that is how she shall remain. Her backstory was forced and it was pushed on us.

(Who is her Dad?, Well his actor changed in the space of months, what does that say?)

Clara, is the DEFINITION of an assistant, not a companion, as the Doctor's partners has grown to be known. She is *literally* there to further a story of the doctors or someone else's.

I keep seeing references to some comment Andy Heaton made on a past pod about him personally knowing that Liverpool had a major, major transfer lined up but couldn't disclose it. Now I thought I had heard it myself towards the start of the summer but can't quite remember; does anyone know which exact pod it was? Also, anyone have any inkling on what it might be? I keep seeing Di Maria mentioned but don't quite believe this, as:  
        **A.)** He's absolutely integral to them and I know Ronaldo personally loves playing with him and Ancelotti holds him in very high regards
          **B.**)The only reason Real could possibly have a need to move him would be if James Rodriguez came in, but Heaton couldn't have known about that earlier in the summer since those rumors seem more recently based off his World Cup exploits
          **C.)** If he does move, doesn't it seem like PSG have already secured him? They don't really seem to care about the FFP sanctions they were hit with (David Luiz for $50 million haha) and the Lavezzi to Milan rumors keep gaining traction, making a Di Maria switch actually sensible for them.

Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated, would also love to hear what other LFC fans think on the matter. And Holy Fuck, I am excited for this season.

Well thinking in the most realistic way possible, Reus is defo not coming, due to Dortmund's firm stand point on selling him. Which leaves one of Pogba, Vidal, Isco and Di Maria as the possible marquee signing that fills the ""O M F G"" descripion

Pogba and Vidal while awesome players are unlikely to join due to the strength of our current central midfield. Gerrard, Henderson, Lucas, Allen and now Can too are gonna be fighting for two in the line up so it's unlikely we're gonna be signing another primarily central midfielder, esp considering we have the exciting Rossiter coming through as well.

So that leaves the Real duo of Isco and Di Maria, who have been linked with exits due to the signing of Kroos and expected arrival of James. Well the most recent reports, mostly rumours yes, but still reports, say that Ancelotti wants to keep Di Maria cause of his experience and versatility, and the fact that he had a good World Cup and was instrumental to their La Decima triumph. Which leaves the mostly likely big name arrival as Isco.

Now this is one special kid. Youtube his highlights, analyze his stats. He can score goals from both near and far, create chances, dribble with the ball, and despite his young age, has a good level of consistency. A player who lead his underdogs of Malaga to a QF in the UCL in 2012, with some remarkable skill and poise and one who can pay on either flank or behind the striker. Many of his characteristics of you look at him, are strikingly similar to a player we signed from Ajax a few years back. Exceptional talent, but one who had yet to emerge and fulfill on his potential to be called World Class.

Man City are also looking to pounce for this creative talent, but cause of Financial Fair Play, a godsend by UEFA, they can only afford to loan him rather then pay the significant fee it will take to acquire him upfront. Reports are saying that an official bid will be made in the upcoming days. 

With the number 7 still vacant, if this signing is made, I firmly believe we will have replaced El Pistolero with the best possible option available, and significantly improved our chances for the upcoming season.

________________________________________________________________________

Q. Do you wish you played another year to be involved in our title challenge last season? #AskCarra

&gt; ""I've been involved in a couple of title challenges but not as close as  the last one but I took the decision to retire and I have to stand by it.""

Q. What did we lack in the title challenge last season - you?

&gt; ""The players and the manager had a great season. Just missed a little bit of luck in the end, strength and depth - not me. A title isn't far away.""

Q. Apart from retirement, what's the toughest football decision you had to take? 

&gt; ""I've never had to take the decision to change the club so retiring from England was the toughest decision I've taken, apart from retirement.""

Q. Who's the best player you ever faced on a football pitch? 

&gt; ""Thierry Henry is the best player I've faced on a football field. I think he's the best we've seen in the Premier League. Him and Arsenal at that time were special.""

Q. What advice would you give a young lad wanting to make it as a footballer?

&gt; ""The mantra for success is no secret - work hard, listen to coaches, right attitude, always be learning, always try to improve. It'll always be that.""

Q. What's the best and worst thing about working with @GNev2 (Gary Neville)?

&gt; ""The best thing about working with Gary is that he's helped me a lot - he's been really good. The worst... he played for Manchester United!""

Q. Are you planning on becoming a manager one day or joining Brendan's staff? 

&gt; ""Not planning on becoming a manager or coach really but you never say never. I'm happy doing the TV show at the moment.""

Q. Do you still shout at the defenders when you're watching the game on the TV? 

&gt; ""I shout at the defenders when watching on TV, but as a fan. Otherwise, I'm calmer off the pitch.""

Q. How did you feel when we were 3-0 down to AC Milan in Istanbul? 

&gt; ""We were devastated at half-time in Istanbul. Biggest game of your life and you think it's all over. You just make sure that you don't embarrass yourself and the club.""

Q. You recently visited India for the first time. Was the trip how you expected?

&gt; ""My visit to India was nice and I really enjoyed it. It was my first time there. I'm sure I'll go back.""

Q. Do you miss playing for #LFC and who at the club do you miss most? 

&gt; ""Yeah, I miss playing for Liverpool and Stevie as he was my closest friend at the club for the last few years. I still see him and speak to him but not everyday.""

From what I understood by reading the information available, I can not deposit more than £15,000 in a tax year (April to April). I know that if I deposit £10, withdraw £5 and then deposit another £10, it will count £20 towards that allowance, despite my withdrawal. 

My understanding was also that the interest earned on my entire balance (which could be £15,000 by the year end) is tax free. When I asked a branch employee about it, I was told only about (actually a bit more than) £5,000 is tax free, the rest is taxable. I tried to find this information online, but everything seems to say that the whole £15,000 is tax free, like the following link:
http://www.barclays.co.uk/Savings/ISAs/InstantCashISAIssue1/P1242628917544?WT.mc_id=301RDcashisa 

If there is any information indicating what the branch employee told me, I'd like to keep it, like the terms and conditions and everything else I've saved. I just can't seem to find it. 

And if that is the case, that the interest on anything over around £5,000 is taxable, is the purpose of the ISA that it provides a better interest rate than normal savings accounts? Also, how does that work the following tax year. If you carried over say £6,000 and put in another £5,000, would the total interest earned on the sum of £11,000 be tax free or would the amount over around £5,000 be taxed? 

I say around £5,000 because the employee said an exact number that I can't remember (e.g. £5,638 or something).

Thanks for any help providing insight into this. Please let me know if I have been unclear on any point. I am just trying to get a good picture of how the whole ISA system works.

I am normally in charge of the guided tours. Anyway, on Saturday it was exceptionally busy as it normally is on the weekends and I was warned a celebrity would be visiting prior to my 1 o'clock slot. Upon arriving at reception I was surprised to see the celebrity was James Milner, he was really quiet but I must stress very polite. 

After the tour (roughly 3 hours) I decided to pluck up the courage and ask why James was in Liverpool and he said upon secrecy that he was soon to be moving to Liverpool. I didn't press him any further because that is of course his personal life. 

I was just wandering if you guys think he will be joining Liverpool? I know Brendan loves a versatile, hard-working player and James is just that. I've heard he is disgruntled by the amount of game time he gets at City so I wouldn't be surprised to see him move. I think for a £10m fee he would be a solid purchase, although there are certainly more 'attractive' players out there. I have wondered whether he may in fact be moving to Everton, but Milner doesn't strike me as a player who would want a loan.

- What are the laws of listening to rebel music in my car or at home, seeing as I don't think it is illegal to buy rebel music in the first place. 

- What are the laws on singing rebel music, at home or in public, people seem to have been persecuted rebel music, yet Gary Og for example, has been recorded as playing rebel music and saying pro IRA slogans and yet he and other rebel bands are not persecuted. 

- Are only certain songs listed as rebel songs? Can I sing certain songs and which part of the law condemns/backs up what I can say and sing.

Now because the warehouse is classed by the planning regulations as a warehouse, to turn it into a performance space will require a ""change of use"" planning applications, and because it also is a ""material change of use"" there are a whole host of building regulations we also will need to comply with.

My questions is whether we could hold an event there under a temporary event notice without having to go through the planning permission process for a change of use?

I've searched everywhere and can't seem to find any definitive answers, the most I've found is this statement ""The giving of a temporary event notice does not relieve the premises user from any requirements under planning law for appropriate planning permission where it is required"". However there appear to be lots of events at various offices/warehouses which I assume haven't through the process of changing the use of the building. Is there something that I'm missing or do people generally just ignore them?

Also if a change of use, and therefore the building regulations, are not required for an event under a temporary event notice, what regulations would have to be met in terms of safety, sanitation, fire escapes etc...

Please could anyone critique my plan below? 


I'm earning £20k a year gross (about £1300 net a month), and have the following cash/savings:

* Cash (in HSBC current account)£4000

* ISAs (2.05%) £7400

* National Savings Certificate (Children's Bonus Bond) £2500

I save £100 a month into the ISAs.

My plan is to instead put all this money into the following two items (ISAs will go into new ISA, Cash and National Savings Certificate (which I will cash out) will go into Santander 123):

* Santander 123 Current Account (3% interest) £6500

* S&amp;S Tracker Fund ISA £7400

Put the £100 a month savings into the tracker.

Is this a good plan? I would be using the Santander account as liquid savings for easy access (as even without the tax free ISA element, I worked out that it seems to be a better deal than any of the easy-access Cash ISAs at the moment). The tracker fund I would be looking at investing in long-term (5 years or more), which should be possible bar a catastrophe. Would one tracker fund be ok, or would it be better to invest in more than one?  

As an aside, I've heard that to get a tracker ISA, you would need to go through a platform as I wouldn't be putting that much into it? How would this work, exactly? 

Thank you for any help! I'll be happy to answer any questions if anyone needs more info.

And spend they have, shelling out over £60 million on players over the past few weeks. But just how successful have Liverpool’s ventures in the transfer market been so far? And what does the club need to do in order to ensure they get the best deals possible and be able to not only make Champions League next season, but challenge for the title as well? 

 

Departures

Only one notable player has departed Anfield so far in the summer, but that player was Liverpool’s most important last season as the club finally qualified for Champions League play following a multi-year absence from the competition. Luis Suarez completed a transfer to Spanish giants FC Barcelona for a fee of £75 million. The striker was Liverpool’s top scorer AND top assister despite missing the first five matches of the season due to suspension.

Suarez leaves the club suspended (again) for a further three months following his bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil a few weeks ago. Unable to train, play, or participate in any football related activities, Liverpool were losing their striker in a season where they would need as much firepower up front as possible. The offloading of Suarez this transfer window was both a necessary and a tactically astute decision: Liverpool got a boatload of money for the striker, and they could reinvest said funds into players who would be available to start from day one of the season, not a third of the way in. Also, selling Suarez now was a guarantee that the maximum amount of money would be brought in, as it is unknown how the striker would have done after returning from suspension at Liverpool.

However, Suarez’s departure put a lot of pressure on Liverpool’s other attacking players, who will now have to score enough goals between themselves to compensate for the striker’s loss. And with the Uruguayan registering a 30+ goal season last term, it will not be easy for Liverpool to blaze through matches 3, 4, or 5-0 like in 2013/14. Striker Daniel Sturridge will be expected to improve on last season’s 25 goal haul and the wingers and midfielders will be put under more pressure to score goals.


 

Arrivals

Brendan Rodgers has quickly reinvested the money received from the sale of Luis Suarez. 20-year old defensive midfielder Emre Can was brought in from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of around £10 million. The player is to be the heir to Steven Gerrard’s position, and could even dethrone the Liverpool legend as the season goes on. Even if Can won’t be a starter this season, he brings in valuable Champions League experience as well as squad depth for Liverpool. It remains to be seen how low he is to be in the pecking order at the start of the campaign, with Lucas Leiva, Joe Allen, Steven Gerrard, and Jordan Henderson all established LFC midfielders.

From, Southampton, Liverpool acquired due Adam Lallana and Ricky Lambert for £25 million and £4.5 million respectively. Lambert was brought in off a stellar 13 goal + 11 assist season, and will add valuable backup to Daniel Sturridge. The 32 year old has shown that he is not done playing at the highest level just yet, and could slot in next to Sturridge in a formation with two strikers just as well as come off the bench as an impact sub. Lallana on the other hand joined Liverpool as their new chief left winger. Called up by Roy Hodgson to the World Cup, Lallana dazzled the Premier League last term as Southampton played some of the most attractive football all season. Quick and technically gifted, Lallana will not find it hard to improve on his nine goal &amp; eight assist season with Southampton.

Lazar Markovic arrived from Portugese champions Benfica for £20 million. The attacking midfielder has been brought in with thoughts for the future, as he currently has not shown that he deserves to overtake Phillipe Coutinho or Rahem Sterling in the starting lineup. However, there may come a time when the £20 million shelled out on him would be seen as a bargain. The 20 year old Serbian international made almost 50 appearances for Benfica, scoring seven goals as the club won the Portugese league, Cup, and League Cup in addition to being runners up in the 2013/14 Europa League final. Markovic is quick but gets dispossessed a little too easily, something he will have to improve on if he intends to be a starter for Brendan Rodgers.

Overall, Liverpool have done well to reinvest the money from the Suarez sale. However, despite all the squad depth options that were brought in, there was a failure to address one of the weakest points in the team- right back. Following Glen Johnson’s poor season and knowing that Martin Kelly is the only replacement in the squad, its a wonder as to how Rodgers did not address the glaring issue first before going in and buying midfielders. Liverpool also need to sign a new striker to fill Suarez’s void. It won’t be easy and certainly won’t be cheap to bring in a player like the Uruguayan, but if Liverpool intend to challenge for the title instead of just Champions League qualification, the purchase is a necessary one. There is good news for the club though, as Liverpool are thought to be close to signing 20 year old Sevilla full back Alberto Moreno for around €20 million. However until that transfer and the purchase of a forward are completed.

Verdict

Liverpool have done a lot in not that much time, having sold their star striker and buying a host of players to strengthen the squad. However, Suarez will be missed in front of goal, as there is nobody else on the team, or in the league for that matter, that can create a goal out of nothing like he can. His sale coupled with the failure to address the issue of right back at Liverpool means that although they have had a solid transfer season (with no intention of stopping anytime soon), Liverpool can still improve on their dealings.

He'd just be a big luxury, and I'd rather spend that money elsewhere where it is needed, like in a new back-up or even starting keeper, full-backs and a world class centre back, that would be money well spent.

Too many people are desperate to replace Suarez, but fact is you can't replace those players, we have to strengthen the whole team instead and add depth, and I believe that is what we are doing, I think we'll be happy with top 4 this season, but we are definitely really starting to build a quality squad now which we haven't had for years.

Remy/Sturridge/Lambert is great depth and only City really have that kind of depth in ST/CF in the league, so goals for me are not a concern, it is our defense that needs to be addressed.

I'd be over the moon if we were able to coup some new starting full-backs and a class centre-back and for me that would be great business with the Suarez money being used to fund those moves.

And I think you can obviously compare our spending to Spurs last season, they lost their big player and replaced him with a number of different players, but I see a few big differences between our spending and theirs, they almost bought in any player that was available, any decent player that was up for joining.. There didn't seem to be any thought into how they would play, and obviously the other failure was AVB who is a poor man manager, he is no coach, hes a tactician.. 

They also bought a bunch of foreign players, that takes longer to gel together.. We seem to have gone for some English players, who know the league well, as well as some foreign talents who add more quality..

Okay ,so Suarez is gone and Liverpool reportedly have a transfer budget of over £120 million, this means that we could potentially afford a world class player or two right? I believe that this is where most Liverpool fans right now are being too naive about the matter.

So in the current Liverpool squad I can only think of 3 players that came from ""big"" clubs, as a rough guideline of what big means I will say  european clubs which attract world class players and can challenge for the champions league. The three players which come to mind are 1)Kolo Touré - now he technically came from Man City so he did come from a big club but he doesn't really count in my mind because he is at the end of his career and was being released from Man City on a free, Liverpool was probably the best club that was interested in him. 2) Daniel Sturridge - When Sturridge came to Liverpool it was from Chelsea (another big club) but once again, I don't think he really counts, he might be a good player now but when he left Chelsea he wasn't considered anywhere near as good as he is currently so there was no competition for his signature. 3) Mamadou Sakho - The only transfer that really surprised me, a player with incredible talent, and still very young and a french international. Also coming from a world class club (PSG) and there would certainly be a high interest in signing him.

Now it is my belief that the option of playing with Suarez was one of the big selling points of Sakho and Sturridge joining Liverpool, now we don't have that selling point any longer what will make world class players want to play for Liverpool? The only things I can think of are the champions league and the history of the club, the depressing thing about this is Liverpool are new to the champions league this year and nearly all of the other clubs going for these players are well established in the competition, they have proved that they can last and stay in the UCL from year to year.

So maybe the champions league is a good selling point for players at smaller clubs which don't have any of the european giants chasing them (e.g. Markovic) but I cannot realistically imagine somebody who is sought after by the top clubs in europe wanting to join a team which might (i'm sorry for saying this) drop out of the champions after a year to not be seen again in the competition for 10 years.

In the past Gerrard was a great attraction to players wanting to join Liverpool, but now he is 34 and has dropped off massively in quality(i'm sorry but he is nowhere near as good as Pirlo currently), he might even retire in a season or two. So Gerrard is only a short term selling point despite him being a legend.

Now if you were a player like Isco (lets face it he's probably not a fan of Liverpool, and probably doesn't care about the history of clubs as long as they are good in the present), why would you ever choose to play alongside players like Sturridge, Henderson, Coutinho and Sterling for 150k a week at max when you could go a few miles down the road to Manchester and play with players like Aguero, Toure, Silva and Navas at probably a higher wage?


Now when you look back at Liverpool's signings over the last 10 years they are mostly like Markovic or Can, good players from good clubs (but not great) who could POTENTIALLY become great players, Liverpool have had alot of great players over the last decade (Alonso, Mascherano, Gerrard, Torres, Suarez etc) but none of those players were bought from the top clubs in europe and you have to remember that when Torres joined we had recently been in 2 champions league finals and that was a great selling point, Suarez was a 1 in a million signing in my honest opinion and not going to sign an already established world class player until we get far in the champions league for multiple years running.


I think it is time that Liverpool fans admit that we are not going to be able to attract world class players like Reus, Sanchez and Isco to Anfield yet, even if we do have enough money for it. But I still believe that we should be aiming higher that to buy players like Loic Remy and James Milner even if we can't aim at buying from the Real Madrids, Bayern Munichs and Barcelonas of this world.



TL;DR: Liverpool are not going to be able to attract a world class player to Anfield until we prove that we can survive in the champions league(playing well against clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich).",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Liverpool fans are being too naive this transfer window,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2b7nij/liverpool_fans_are_being_too_naive_this_transfer/

To be granted ""work permit"" a player according to the FA needs to play at least 75% of the national teams games in the last two seasons.

If a player doesn't meet this criteria it's unlikely he'll get a work permit.

According to the newspaper, Besic wouldn't be able to play at Everton until september, but if he plays all the national teams games during the fall he'd be eligible. According to a newspaper, Besic could staly at Ferencváros on loan from Everton during the fall, and then he'd be granted work permit for the spring.

Another complication of the situation is the ownership of the player: He's owned 30% by Ferencváros, 70% by Hamburg. The new informations reveal that Hamburg didn't pay the ""educational fee"" (don't know exactly what it's called) for the team Besic started playing at: Tennis Borussia Berlin. Since Hamburg never payed any money for them, it seems Berlin would get money from the transfer as well, according to FIFA rules.

According to goal.com a €6 million fee has been agreed nevertheless.

Growing up in England, I watched a lot of TV. All of the ""British"" comedy I've seen was English (~~except maybe Father Ted~~). In fact, I didn't know Scotland had its own comedy shows until I moved back here.

I have a few questions for people south of the border: Do you ever see Scottish comedy on TV? If so, is it on a minor digital channel at 3AM? Are the strong accents a barrier? Is the sense of humour noticeably different?

In case you haven't seen any of our comedies and you're curious:

Manchester vs Barcelona. Iniesta makes a gorgeous pass to Messi. Messi the best finisher on the planet has a 1v1 with Joe Hart. Demichelis short of options lunges for a slide tackle outside of the penalty box. Messi is too fast he takes Messi down and gets a red card. To make matters worse he gets a penalty which ultimately ends up deciding the game and to a large part the tie.

Two weeks later against Wigan Manchester City gets knocked out of the FA Cup. You can guess who fouled a player inside the box and earned Wigan the game deciding penalty. It was once again Demichelis.

The press were ALL OVER THE GUY. ""Why does Manuel Pellegrini keep picking Martin Demichelis"" this was a headline from one of the websites. ESPN had a similar article where granted they pretty much stated Pellegrini is simply out of options.

The reality was Demichelis was getting used to starting in the BPL (and UCL) with a new team and a new system. When a Striker makes a snafu you get Negredo. When a Centerback does it you get headlines asking for his head. The truth is unbalanced but that is reality and that is why Demichelis gets paid.

Fast forward to July 4th 2014. Demichelis enters the world stage against Belgium playing for Argentina in the Quater Final of the world cup. Up to this point the team defense has been shaky. This would all change starting with this game. After Belgium Argentina was a rock defensively. And just about everyone pointed out what a great performance Demichelis put in against Belgium.

July 13th 2014. The biggest game on the planet features 4 Center Backs. Boateng, Hummels, Garay and Demichelis. In a span of 5 months Demichelis went from a player who was perceived as a weak point to a starter for a World Cup finalist. The end result is meaningless. The turnaround in my opinion is legendary and should get more attention from us the fans. Because Demichelis really deserves credit for both helping Argentina get to the Finals and Manchester City lifting their second BPL trophy in the last 3 years.

Personally my opinion of Demichelis has taken a complete 180. A few months ago I couldn't wait for him to retire. Today with Mangala coming in I think Demi should be the starter. I think he earned it and at 32 still has 1-2 good seasons left in him. His marking and tackling are world class. He may not be the fastest but he makes up for it by being a very smart player.

I recently bought a road bike I currently use to commute every day to work (my commute distance is around 5 miles each way) and I am pretty happy with it. When I bought it, I had that project of doing some longer rides over the week-end and I thought it would be a great time to start doing it now I have the bike and it's still warm.

I've done some research about it and it turns out, the London to Brighton ride is a pretty common path for getting started with long rides.
So I was wondering if you guys had any advice or tips for a beginner. I don't really mind doing it over two days if this is necessary.

I'm thinking about taking the following list of items in my backpack/on my bike:

* Spare inner tube
* Pump
* Puncture repair kit
* Lights
* D-Lock

Also, if anyone like-minded (preferably around my age -- mid-twenties, but not mandatory) is interested in buddying up, don't hesitate to contact me! (Keep in mind I am a beginner and it won't be a racy-pace ride).
I am planning on doing it the next week-end or the following one, depending on the weather.

So here’s a list of former Liverpool Reserves and Academy stars who a lot of us thought were the next big thing but sadly didn’t really amount to anything.

Dani Pacheco:

The versatile attacker joined the club in 2007 from the world famous La Masia. Nicknamed El Asesino (The Assassin), he was a star performer at Barcelona’s youth sides along with likes of Thiago Alcantara. His quality was quite obvious early on. In most games he looked head and shoulders above the rest of the players in his age group. Dani, personally was the best player I had seen at reserve level and he showed glimpses of his quality when he went on loan to Norwich in The Championship where he scored 2 goals in 6 games. This was followed by loans at Rayo Vallecano and SD Huesca. Unfortunately he could not make his mark there and was allowed to join Alcorcon in the 2013-14 season. Dani made a total of 17 appearances with 1 assist for the first team before his departure.

Where is he now:  After a decent season with Alcorcon in the Segunda Division where he played 32 times with 5 goals and 7 assists, he joined Real Betis in who are hoping to get promoted to La Liga in the new season.
 
Krisztian Nemeth:

The prolific goal scorer was one of the many young Hungarian players we signed through a deal with MTK Budapest 2007. Before joining Liverpool he already had 18 goals in 37 appearances for MTK. Big things were expected from young Nemeth and rightfully so as he became the top scorer of the Premier Reserves League North and helped the Reserves win the Premier Reserves League North title. Within the same season he also won the Reserves Player of the Season award. After going through injuries he joined Blackpool on loan which was followed by a spell at AEK Athens. It was quite obvious that injuries had really deteriorated his game and he was allowed to join Olympiacos in 2010.

Where is he now: Recently became a free agent after a decent season with Dutch side Roda JC where he managed to get 8 goals and 6 assists in 24 appearances.

Daniel Ayala:

The Spanish centre back joined the Liverpool Academy in 2007 after rejecting a contract with Sevilla. An assured and stronger defender he was seen as a key figure in Liverpool first team in years to come. The youngster was given his debut by Rafa Benitez when Martin Skrtel went off with an injury against Tottenham Hotspurs in 2009. During his time at Liverpool he was sent on loan to Hull City and Derby County where he managed just under 30 appearances combined. After just making 5 first team appearances for Liverpool he was sold to Norwich City in 2011 when it became clear that he wasn’t good enough.

Where is he now: Ayala is currently playing at Middlesborough in The Championship. He made 19 appearances and scored 3 goals for the Championship side last season.

Gerardo Bruna:

The highly rated midfielder joined Liverpool in 2007 from Real Madrid’s Academy. He was considered a really big talent and rightfully so as it was obvious the youngster had the technique and brain to succeed along with a wicked eye for a free kick. Sadly things did not go according to plan for Bruna and his career at Liverpool was just one injury after another. Despite his ability he could not stay fit and was allowed to join Blackpool in 2011.

Where is he now:  After 2 seasons at Blackpool with just 4 first team appearances, Bruna joined SD Huesca in 2013 for whom he made 19 appearances with just 1 goal to his name. At the moment he is on trial at Tranmere Rovers.

Nikola Saric:

The Danish striker joined Liverpool from Herfølge Boldklub in 2008. He came with quite a reputation. Having turned downed an opportunity to sign for Barcelona and Tottenham earlier in his career and was said to be pursued by Europe’s top clubs before joining Liverpool. Unfortunately Saric’s time at Liverpool much like Bruna’s was filled with injuries and because of that he was not able to show his full potential. After failing to break through to the first team, Saric joined Croatian side Hajduk Split in 2011.

Where is he now: Saric failed to make an impact at Hajduk and then joined HB Koge in Denmark where he was also unable to make an impact. Right now he is at Danish lower division side B1908 Amager.

My idea at the moment is to make her a Tardis replica that has:

1. A functional purpose. I want this tardis to be openable with a couple shelves or something so she could store things in there, (nothing big, but enough to put jewelry or something.)

2. A badass gimmick. I want it to appear as if it is actually bigger on the inside. In the first link below, I saw where a woman had used a couple of angled mirrors to create a fairly simple illusion of space. Seeing as my Tardis is going to be much larger than her's, (I'm thinking 8'' base and a little over a foot tall) I figured perhaps I could go the extra mile and somehow use mirrors and a couple photos to create an image that looks like the inside of the Tardis.
http://vimeo.com/82424553

Obviously this is going to take a very clever, and subtle solution if it's going to be pulled off gracefully. But I'm really hoping for a 'wow' factor for anyone that looks inside of it! 

List of things that came to mind:
One-way mirrors
a series of mirrors that bounce a hidden image and magnify it
The use of small lights behind the mirrors to reflect a spacier lit room appearance.

Lastly, if any of you would be kind enough to direct me to other possible subreddits in which I can find help, that would be much appreciated!

Fernando Torres's time here at Chelsea Football Club has been very hard to explain in words. The emotions of a last gasp winner against Manchester City. Then the confidence is lost. Watching as Fernando  misses wide of a empty net that leave many fans scratching their heads in utter confusion. 
__________________________________________________________
For the stat heads like myself out there, Torres (in 3 years at Chelsea) has the ability to match pound for pound with many of the top clinical Center Forwards in Europe. The overall data is quite nice and if the matches were played out on paper, the public's opinion on Torres would be quite drastically different.

For example;

In 172 Appearances for Chelsea (All Competitions)
[Torres has 45 Goals and 35 Assist]

Not great by any means but still not a total flop right. 

This video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgIKbkmEcAw) shows all his goals last season and for me show that he still has the sparks of being a world class striker, but overall just lacks the ability to have a strong and consistent game.

What's your view on his time here? Is it total flop or has Torres contributed something that when he leaves will be seen as worthwhile to the club?

Currently further looking into the details, but I guess you could consider this **answered**, thanks!

So my boyfriend and I have been together for a few years now, but we've **never** been able to meet in person as I live in the US and he lives in England. I turn 18 in a little under a month, and we've spent the past three months or so planning to have me finally move in with him as it is difficult emotionally to be at such a distance. His family is glad to provide me a place to live and pay for me to live and eat, but even in that three months I haven't managed to find many resources on emigrating to the UK from the US.

What I've established so far is that I:

1. Need to apply for a family living permit as an unmarried partner
2. Need proof that I'll be paid for and housed
3. Will need to apply for a UK housing card after my family living permit Visa is up, and every 1-5 years after until I'm a citizen.
4. Have horrid chances being approved as an 18-year-old
5. May be aided by the fact that I work online and can take my work with me
6. May be aided by the fact that I plan to go to university in the UK.

What I need to know is: what specific information am I missing? I know I'm missing some, it can't be that simple to move permanently across the world.

EDIT: So far what I've learned is that being at a distance for this long greatly helps my chances of being accepted, talking on Skype daily as I have been helps my chances of being accepted, records of gifts being sent help my chances, and that it costs about what I would expect to move.

I recently started riding with my gf, she got her full license in January and I did my CBT in april, and we are looking at bike to bike comms solutions but I'm not sure what to go with.

radios and bluetooth solutions seem to two choices but both can be several hundred pounds to kit out 2 riders. I've seen people talk about generic bluetooth kits of ebay but I'm not sure of the quality and don't want to waste money if they are going to be useless.

What about these 2? I presume they are cheap quality but if they work that's fine

I'm renting at the moment, but it pisses me off that all my cash goes into someone else's pocket each month. 

Thing is I have previously owned two houses and the ownership experience is stressful, always more expensive than anticipated and selling is such a bastard. 

I have been looking around flats for a few weeks and I have found a place I really like, but the letting agent is, to be frank, a cunt. With all the fees renting is going to cost me around 25% more per month than buying an equivalent property, AND my money just disappears.

But buying is scaring the shit out of me. I have never lived city center before, I think I'm going to love it, but I can't be sure until I try it. I know what a massive pain in the arse selling a place can be, and it ties up 75% of my savings.  

I'm not sure if this is just the agent or the norm for Manchester City Center, but they want to charge me £500 to 'secure' the flat with no indication that this will be refunded or added to my deposit. Is this normal? Are they taking the piss? What are my rights - if any? 

No matter the dickish nature of the agent, my instinct is to rent for 6 months, take the hit and then buy a place if we really like it in the city.

I joined a new company around 2 and a half months ago in a permanent role with a standard 3 month probationary period. Overall, I'm happy with the company, like my colleauges and feel that the workload is sufficient. As far as I can tell, the company is also very happy with my performance and integration thus far.

However, I'm not convinced that this is what I want long term - I have been considering making a move back into contracting, but I'm not sure that now is quite the right time.

Currently, my notice period is 2 weeks on either side until the end of my probation period - which is fine, however afterwards it rises to 8 weeks, which puts me in a tougher spot if I wanted to move back to a contract role (market moves too fast, very few employers are willing to wait 8 weeks for a contractor to ride out a 2 month notice).

Additionally, I do not receive any significant contractual benefits from the role once my probation period is up - the only relevant factor (as per my contract) is the notice period. 

Can I request that my probation be extended to give me more time to evaluate the role? I tried searching Google but apparently this is not a common question, so hopefully someone here can give their advice.

I charge this company £15 per hour. Theres not that much to do really though - it's really light, so over the last 4 months there's only about £100

But I was wondering how I go about getting this money - whether I need to be self employed or anything like that? It seems daft for such a small amount, and surely it would be well under tax free earning brackets?

What's your opinion on this? I think we have a lot of talent in our midfield which is why I want this sort of formation. It gets rid of Glen Johnson as a RB which I think is better as he never actually stays back and defends + Gerrard and Henderson have proved themselves as defensive-enough players to support the back line when needed.

Twice this week I've tried to post on this forum, this first was a post where I wanted to discuss how much Capaldi looked like Hartnell in this still from the trailer: http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2am5r7/theres_something_gloriously_hartnell_about_this/ / https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsdMNEtCYAElWVt.jpg

Another was a rather amusing title I saw on Sky News: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtD73CPIAAAvFYA.jpg - I imagine this may have been downvoted to hell, but I respect reddits choice in the matter!

I just worry that this subreddit is becoming too sameish. It's ""Look at my TARDIS cake."" Or ""Look at my Cosplay!"" Or ""Hey, I met Captain Jack!"" - I like seeing all of these posts, but a bit of variety would go a long way, perhaps the mods would consider loosening the posting guidelines slightly?

Initial thought
&gt;Good decision by Steven Gerrard, 114 caps great servant for England.

England's loss is Liverpool's gan?
&gt;Both as not many young alternatives in that holding role for England. Lfc get a fresher Gerrard.

Is there anyone in the team capable of filling the leadership void left now?
&gt;Big decision no stand out candidate.

Ross Barkley good enough to be the ""next Gerrard""?”
&gt;In his attacking role yes but not as the holding player at the moment.

How long do you reckon it will be before Gerrard retires from Liverpool Carra?
&gt;3/4 years depends if he's happy to be a squad player as he gets older.

Do you thank Rooney could take the armband?
&gt;Yes him and Joe Hart the two leading candidates.

- How early would I have to pick up a ticket to one of the big matches? I'd assume locals would have priority (loyalty point?)

  Job done?  
  No! They were supposed to have been delivered before last weekend, they still hadn't turned up, so I chased it up.  
  I was told that they would definitely be delivered by Wednesday last week. Nope, still no beer. I left it for the weekend, after chatting to my mate again and decided that it was time to start shouting at people.  
  The Amazon seller told me it had been dispatched by Yodel, and that they had attempted to deliver it several times. Not so. So, I phoned them having been freshly furnished with a tracking number/ID.  
    
  After much arguing, and headache, it turned out that the package number I had been given was for a package to a lady in Gloucester. My mate is not a lady, and he lives in Hampshire. So, in order to track it, I had to give them his post code. Guess what, the postcode he gave me was wrong, so, now we have no tracking number, and a wrong post code.  
  After even more time, someone at Yodel searched via delivery name and supplied me with a phone number for their delivery driver, whom, in due course told me that she'd delivered my case of beers at some point last week, but couldn't tell me where.  
  
  *Can I take your number so I can call you when I get home, I might have written down who I delivered it to?*

First post here on UKPF, great sub you have here!

I just signed up for an account on CreditExpert.co.uk, and have a few questions about improving my credit score which is quite low (649).

The first question I have is regarding this aspect:

**'You have no successfully settled credit account'**

This is strange, as I settled a vehicle finance account about six weeks ago. I paid it off aprox. 8 months early - could this be why it's not showing as a successfully settled account? In fact, it's not showing at all on my credit report - any thoughts on why this might be?

I have finance on another vehicle and that is showing on my report as satisfactory - so I have no idea why the other finance account is not showing.

Next, about this:

**'The age of your accounts indicates lenders are likely to view you as higher risk'**

I've only been in the UK just over three years so there's not much I can do about this I guess. My main bank account was created July 2011.

I have three extra credit cards that I don't really use, created in November 2012, August 2013 and June 2014. These cards had some quite high balances recently but they are now all cleared or close to it. Would closing these credit cards improve my credit score and if so, how? Are open accounts the only accounts taken into consideration when calculating the average account age?
I also have a Barclays current account that I opened in March 2013 and never used, would it be advisable to close this account?

Another of the negative reasons showing on my credit report is:

**'You have recently opened 1 or more new credit accounts.'**

Does anyone know what constitutes 'recent'?

Would closing the aforementioned credit cards remove this warning?

The last warning I have a question about is:

**'The usage of your available credit indicates a higher risk'**

This warning is showing a value of 31%, due to a ~ £1500 balance on a Natwest CC. What sort of % of available credit used is seen as a healthy figure? Or is it simply a case of the closer to 0% the better?

Any advice &amp; input appreciated.

Their arguments were as follows: 

-Liverpool as a club is past its prime and no longer a ""big club"". People don't aspire to play for LFC like they once did



-Liverpool don't have a player to ""draw"" other star players anymore. Nobody is going to leave their club to play with a Daniel Sturridge or Steven Gerrard. That is, they claimed Gerrard was past his prime and Studge isn't a big enough name. Basically, they believed we should have made a marquee big name signing to ""replace"" Suarez best we could rather than sign the likes of Lambert, Origi, Markovic, Remy etc. 

-Last year's season cannot be repeated because we don't have Suarez and our club won't be able to handle the burden of more games. 

-Lallana was an overpriced and won't be as impactful as his pricetag suggests he should be. 

-Our defence is poor

Now I know the window is far from over but I want to know how you guys feel about these critics? I think it'll make a good bit of discussion to address some of these points as they seem to be rather common throughout the football fan community right now.

He's great playing from the wing, but through the middle he is the perfect modern No. 10. I feel with another strong season he will be held in the same regard as more established Premier League No. 10's like David Silva, Juan Mata, Rooney and Cazorla.

However, with the new signings we've brought in, we have a plethora of players who can play in that position. Sterling was probably the best player in the Premier League in that position for the last 3 months of last season. We've just spent £25m on Adam Lallana who will surely be a front runner for that position too. Where will Coutinho fit in?

Assuming we play a 4-3-3 formation next season, you'd expect the new signings to start straight away. That means the 3 attacking midfielders behind Sturridge would be Markovic, Lallana and Sterling.  I feel this is very cruel on Coutinho who deserves to start for us. His showings in the recent pre-season friendlies add more fuel to that argument.

I am a Canadian citizen (25 F) in the process of obtaining a Tier 5 Youth Mobility Scheme visa to live and work in the UK, as well as travel throughout Europe. I will be making the move in October. I was not planning on living in London due to it being expensive and that it is a bigger city than I originally want to reside in. However, a family friend who lives in Spain owns a 2 bedroom flat in Manor House, London that he keeps for when he/his GF is in town for business. He said he will rent it out to me for cheap which rules! However I was reading up on the area and found some conflicting information in regards to how ""safe"" the area is. Apparently this flat is 100m from the Manor House tube station. Can anyone give me an idea of what that area is like? I've lived in a typical suburban-like area my whole life, so I just want to know what I can expect for when I make the move. I just would like to know if it's worth it living in this area in London for the fact I can get cheap rent, and be closer to the bigger airports so I have more options regarding travel, OR should I just look at the other cities I was intending on living in? Before I was offered the deal of this flat, I was looking at living in either Bristol, Manchester or Edinburgh. 

Also (kind of an unrelated question) do pubs in the UK accept a Canadian drivers license as ID? I'd rather not take my passport with me if I decide to go for a couple pints.

I then contacted $ISP and they said that I had no 'active charges' with them, but the chap gave me an email address to the reimbursement people. I emailed them with copies of my statements clearing stating that they charged me £15 each month.

They told me that they were not charging me for anything. I told them to check again. Haven't heard anything yet.

I went to my bank today to try and block the number. End result was that I phoned up a division of theirs and managed to get it blocked. Not only that, but they said they could get it reimbursed too.

If its the wrong subreddit for this type of thing then please let me know of where i can seek the advice im looking for, as these are very unusual circumstances that im currently in.

So about 2 weeks ago i applied for a job at Asda working Nights at a store 10-15minutes away from my nearest Asda store, as this literally was the only store within my area that Asda were hiring. *To get to the further away ASda store, i literally have to drive past my closest Asda store anyway, which is approx 10-15minutes away depending on traffic*. So I figured i may as well go for it and see what happens because im desperate for a job.

Subsequently a week ago i got invited to a group (Magic) interview where we were told to bring 'our personality'. At the interview we were organized into groups to get to find out abit more about each other and work together in a group task. There were 3 other people going specifically for the Night Job as well, but there were 8 candidates overall applying for other positions. At the group interview, it sounded like they were fairly in need of night staff, and gave very suttle hints that they were looking for 2 additional night staff members.

I felt the group interview went quite well and was told i would hear something by the end of the weekend. Luckily The very next day i got a call telling me i had been successful in the group interview, and i was invited to a 1 to 1 interview and a 'have a go @ the job' session with the night manager in a week. Now whats weird is at the very end of the call, i was immediately told the induction dates of when the new staff would be enrolled. I thought this was quite strange as in my past job interviews, i've never been told about induction dates until i was actually offered the job i was applying for.

Anyway fast forward to today, i check my email as i normally do and i get a job alert from Asda. I now find out that my nearest Asda store is hiring for night staff as well and based on the contract/hours, the job is exactly the same as the job i applied for, at the Asda store much further away.

I now feel a little bit awkward situation. Obviously i would love to work at my nearest Asda store since it would be alot more convenient for me, especially in terms of traveling and expenses in the long run. However, im basically half way to getting a job at the Asda store that's further away. I'm not sure what to do. Im really close to getting a job now to help support myself while im still at uni, but i don't want to jeopardize my chances. 

I guess what im asking is, in order for me to actually get the job at my nearest Asda store since its only 10-15minutes away, would i have to go through the entire application process again including the group interview. Or if there's any possibility of me having my 1 to 1 interview at my nearest Asda store than the one that's further away? Or am i strictly bound to having the interview at the other store i originally applied for? 

I really don't know what to do. If some kind people of Reddit could help me solve this dilemma that would be greatly appreciated.

Personally, I think Griezmann would be a fantastic signing, but I'm not sure Spurs would drop the cash on him + another quality striker.  I'm of the mind that we should give Ade/Soldado a chance and go all in for Griezmann.

I am a member of the Department of Experimental Psychology in Bristol University and I’m looking for smokers to take part in my study.

We are conducting research comparing a gamified and standard stop-signal task. Essentially we are investigating whether making computerised psychological tests more ‘gamelike’ affects their ability to be used as tools for scientific research. Specifically we are comparing a newly developed ‘gamified’ test with its traditional counterpart. This game is designed for children, so it’s not too serious!

IMO there's a great chance this happens this transfer window and it's a matter of when, not if...

We can capture James Milner and Balotelli for roughly £50-60m (every night I pray for at least James to join our squad lol). These two transfers would really be how we spent the Suarez transfer money. 

Balotelli has made it clear he wants to return to England and AC Milan have made it clear they want him gone. Even without capturing Di Maria, Lavezzi's transfer to Milan to replace him seems imminent. 
  
I believe his potential outweighs the negatives for us. I don't think Balotelli will ruin the team chemistry/morale. We've all seen what Balotelli can do (amazing plays to his hundredsssss of WTF moments). IMO, he's had a lot of humbling moments in his recent years. The mixture of Brendan Rodgers, (O Cap'n My Cap'n) Stevie G, and the rest of our core players in the squad wouldn't let him ruin what we're building. Although he possibly could offset our team chemistry, I doubt it would happen because he fits our playing style and is a viable-great replacement for Suarez. He turns 24 (!!!) soon and even though he is not as creative as Suarez, he matches well in most other areas. Our attack would be pretty crazy and intense for the entire game, as we would also have Remy and Lambert on the bench.

If he comes back to England as Liverpool player, I think it only benefits us and he could be our missing piece to winning the league. If he joins another squad, I can see him scoring the goal that bites us in the ass and costs us the league. 

How do you guys feel about him? Should we pursue or not? If he returns to England for another team, do you think that it will hurt us, directly or indirectly or not at all?

First post on reddit so please bear with me if I don't post this correctly.  

So a little about myself.  I live in Brooklyn, late 20's, relatively experienced with the outdoors (camping and hiking.)  So about a month back I had just gotten through a pretty long and difficult project I had signed on to do.  I had a little extra cash in my pocket and really wanted to go on a trip.  After asking some friends if they wanted to do anything and not really finding anything that worked for everyone I got pretty impulsive.  I've always wanted to travel over to Scotland and do some exploring so one night I kind of just said why not and bought the plane ticket.  I'll be heading over for two weeks in mid September.

Now in my long search of trying to get an idea of what I want to do while I'm there I found something that really interested me.

Obviously I'm bringing maple syrup, I've just ordered in some BC smoked salmon and I'll probably bring a selection of maple candies.

Now my question for you guys;

What is something from either Canada or the States that you can't find over there? Or even something you view as SUPER American. I'm picking up treats for people aged 8 to 90 so any suggestions would be marvellous!!

I'm staying in Guisborough and am primarily interested in the following: Abbey ruins (and other ruins), moorland covered in heather, steam trains and beautiful scenery. I know that there are buses and trains for transportation. My ask of you good redditors is simple, I have a plan but I would like to make sure that 1) it is feasible in the amount of time and 2) I'm not missing something super neat. 

Here goes:
Day 1 (Saturday): Wake up early and walk to the priory. Grab 9:17 X93 bus to Whitby (arrive 10 am) - walk to ruined abbey and through town. Take the 12:18 Esk Valley train to Egton and walk to Glaisdale (seeing Begger's Bridge) hop back on the 16:30 train and go to Castleton Moor or Danby (walk/hike for three more hours). Take the 19:53 train back to Middlesbrough and take the 5 bus back to Guisbrough. (I'm not quite sold on Egton/Glaisdale/Castleton Moor/Danby - recommendations for stops along the Esk Valley rail line appreciated!)

Day 2 (Sunday): Wake up early - take a taxi to Helmsley (are there cabs on Sunday mornings?). Spend 3-4 hours walking to Rievaulx Abbey. From Helmsley, take a taxi to Pickering and catch the 12 pm North York Moors Railway to Levisham. Walk in Levisham for three hours, pick up the 15:30 train to Goathland, get off and spend an hour there walking, take last train to Grosmont and from there to Whitby and from there a bus to Guisborough. Unless I am better finding a taxi on a Sunday evening in Goathland and taking my time with the hike. (Choosing Levisham and Goathland to walk is arbitrary, any suggestions?)

Is this too much to fit in? My book of easy walks in the North York Moors comes on Wednesday. Thank you for any suggestions and help!



EDIT: Thank you all so much! You all are right - this is way too ambitious! New plan: Get in via train to Malton Friday night - stay in Helmsley. I'm assuming Malton has a taxi to take me to Helmsley since I will be getting in after the bus stops running. Wake up and walk to Rievaulx Abbey and enjoy! Once I'm done in Helmsley - grab the 128 bus to Pickering. Get aboard the North York Moors Railway in Pickering to see some scenery - depending on time, maybe get off at Goathland, or maybe just enjoy the ride. End the day in Whitby, have dinner, look through the town, etc. and overnight there. Wake up in Whitby and explore the Abbey and town. Take the Esk Valley line and get off as time permits for a walk - at least enjoying the scenery along the way. Take the rail all the way to Middlesbrough. Wake up Monday morning and catch my train out of Middlesbrough.

Neutral supporter here. First off let me say I'm sorry your team has been plundered this transfer window, since coming up Saints have been a great addition to the premier league, best of luck for the upcoming campaign.

I'm not sure if it was last season or the season before but I remember watching a Southampton match and seeing JWP play and being absolutely blown away by his crossing ability. I've tried to keep tabs on  him since but I'm curious with the departures you guys have had what role he'll play for the 14-15 campaign. 

It might be early to tell with a new manager and all but is there any chance of him being a regular starter? How do you guys rate him?

What I am needing is a few people who have intermediate knowledge and experience in a few areas to help contribute and work on getting this website up and running.

I am looking for 2-3 individuals who have advanced experience and knowledge in writing opinion/analytic pieces as well as intermediate to advance knowledge of social media, wordpress, and website development. 

This is not a paid gig but rather a brain child born from passion, so I am looking for individuals who are really willing to take this seriously and move forward in making this happen. Please do not respond if this is something you think will be a 3 week obsession in which you will eventually lose interest being involved with. 

If this sounds like something you would love to do PM me with any questions or let me know you would like to get involved!

YNWA

EDIT: I forgot to mention I am a freelance writer who is contributing as well. This is not me asking someone to make a site. It's me asking who would like to get involved in starting this site with me, as with the ambitions I have for this, I would not be able to take it on myself.

Edit 2: Okay someone just messaged me regarding Video within the website and wanted me to email them. Will you please PM me again as the message has disappeared and I didn't catch your name! Thank You!

EDIT: This was supposed to be a light hearted post where I was reaching out to others who were interested in starting something I wanted to start as well. I am not trying to use anyone nor do I need tips on dispersing revenue, etc. These are things I would be discussing with the people who wanted to help me build this site. So please only post or message me if you are wanting to help create this. I didn't come asking for an investor.

They have a lot to do this season",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Who Is In Brendan's Envelopes This Summer?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2bdo8y/who_is_in_brendans_envelopes_this_summer/

**How much are you supposed to apply?**


Sun factor is calculated by applying 2.0mg/cm^2, or roughly 1/4 teaspoon. Obviously this is a range depending on the density of the product and size of the surface area for application (your face), so we're looking at a range from 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon for your face. 

The [beginner's skincare routine](http://np.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/beginners#wiki_4._sunscreen_.3C--click_to_see_product_recommendations) recommends 1/4 teaspoon as well as this [blogpost](http://www.futurederm.com/2013/04/26/how-much-exactly-is-2-0-mgcm2-the-amount-of-sunscreen-necessary-to-achieve-the-labeled-spf-rating/), this other [blogpost](http://www.brightestbulbinthebox.com/2014/04/is-14-tsp-enough-sunscreen-for-your-face.html) recommends between 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon, and the [NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/video/pages/how-to-apply-sunscreen.aspx) (the UK national health service) recommends 2 teaspoons for your face and arms.

So 1/4 of a teaspoon is the most common, as well as on the low end of the recommended amount. We'll take that number. 

**Is a teaspoon a standardised measurement?**

According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaspoon#As_a_US_unit) there is a standard size that is equal to 5ml. So we have a solid number. 

**So why am I confused?**

Because, compare the photo of 1/4 teaspoon from the [Futurederm post](http://d2bv6hl03c3wms.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMAG0305.jpg) and [Brightestbulbinthebox's post](http://www.brightestbulbinthebox.com/2013/06/how-much-is-2-milligrams-per-centimeter.html), specifically [this photo](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IdI8l2kENv0/Ub4r29A4_gI/AAAAAAAADFU/guryki_6Pf4/s1600/DSC01076.JPG). That's a fuckload of sunscreen, it really supports the whole ""it's more than you think!"" advice for appropriate sunscreen application. 

I couldn't find a measurement smaller than a teaspoon available for me, so I measured out a teaspoon (5ml) of sunscreen myself - more than double the recommended amount. 1/4 teaspoon is about 1.2ml  [This is what a whole teaspoon of sunscreen looks like.](http://imgur.com/a/i007I)

**So... what's going on?** Volume-wise, I'm applying far more than the recommended amount (That teaspoon of sunscreen is the amount I use daily), but a visual comparison shows that it's far less than what other people are saying.",false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,null,null,self,"Is it just me, or is 1/4 teaspoon of sunscreen for your face a very low amount?",6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2bdrej/is_it_just_me_or_is_14_teaspoon_of_sunscreen_for/

I just completed my first year at a top London university, studying Economics, obtaining a 2:1 . I was working but sadly I was let go as they wanted someone that could be full-time for the whole year. I speak English and Spanish fluently.I also speak 2 other languages but at a more basic level. I achieved A*AAB on my A-levels and 6A* 3A and a B at GCSE. I am willing to do any sort of work as my past experience includes working at a cafe and being a builder. I know how to use microsoft office. I have applied to multiple jobs but none have rang back yet. I have been to job centers but they say that they cant offer me anything unless I have a national insurance number, which I cant obtain yet as I dont have a permanent residence at the moment. I am an EU citizen so I am eligible to work in the UK for 3 months without a national insurance number Any places you recommend?

Thank you,

I'm a longtime Whovian (classic &amp; new Who). My girlfriend and her 11 year old son and 12 year old daughter have not yet been introduced to the delights of Doctor Who, and I am hoping to introduce them in such a way that they will love it and watching Doctor Who can become something we do regularly ""as a family"", starting with the new series as it airs.

I'm planning to show a couple of episodes back to back one evening to introduce them, in advance of the new series starting in August, and wanted to ask your opinions on which would be the best episodes to show?

I'm thinking the first episode should be Blink, because it's a great standalone story, not too heavy on sci-fi. For the second episode I am wondering about showing Rose, after all it was designed to introduce Who to a modern audience. But I also wondered about picking another stand alone episode like Girl in The Fireplace or maybe something like Vincent &amp; the Doctor, or Dalek, to give more a flavour of what it's all about. Maybe even ""The Empty Child"" but that would be a 2 parter of course. Thoughts?

So the question on the table is:

What goods/services do you tend to tip and how much do you tend to tip?

**Please note this isn't a question about whether you should or shouldn't tip**, I'm interested in what people's real life practices are with regards to tipping.

I'll start by answering for myself:

Restaurants: 

* bad experience - no tip
* average experience - 5 - 10%
* good experience - 15%

Takeaway deliveries:

* late delivery - will round up to nearest pound
* on time delivery - £2 - £3 tip
* early deliver - £3 - £5 tip

Taxi

* bad experience - will round up to nearest pound
* average experience - £2 - £3 tip
* great experience - £3 - £5 tip 

Those are the only three services that I tip.

Cliffsnotes version of the story follows:

Saturday: Leg day at the gym.  Smoked myself, but nothing painful that day.

Sunday: Onset of the most intense pain I've ever experienced in my life.  Localized in the lower abdomen and groin -- I'm thinking ""fuck, I gave myself a hernia yesterday.""  Pain subsided on its own after a little bit of lying down.  Can't find any lump or bulging to suggest herniation, but inguinal hernia is the only thing I can think of.  Plan to head into the hospital tomorrow to have it checked out.

Monday: No pain at all -- until around 6PM local.  Crippling pain this time, like somebody was booting me in the rocks over and over.  Once it finally dies down, I take that as my cue to pour myself into my car and get to a hospital -- could have called an ambulance, but didn't feel like being stranded, and the pain was still manageable at this point.  Good thing I left when I did though, because everything ramped right the hell up once I started getting signed into the hospital.  I got in to see a physician pretty quickly, all things considered, and had blood drawn after the doc came in for an initial assessment.  I was then given IV fluids and morphine, as the pain was pretty significant.  I was eventually given a CT scan, as well.

Yeah, turns out I don't have a hernia -- which is good, given the treatment is surgical intervention.  No, I apparently have fucking kidney stones (yes, plural), which is more painful than childbirth by all accounts I've heard.

I say all of that to say this: listen to your body.  It generally has a clue when something's wrong, and will definitely let you know.

Also, I figure this is as good a time as any to warn you all that I'm going to be on percoset the next few days, so please forgive any statements that seem more retarded than usual from me.

I recently graduated with honors from UCLA and decided to move to London and look for work. Fortunately, I have citizenship so no extra paperwork is required. 

I have experience working in all of the aforementioned fields and my skills include working with SEO and research tools like Google Adwords and Google Analytics. Moreover, I also have experience working in media publicity and licensing companies. Lastly, I was a manager of an apartment building for over a year.

We both wondered why a reward for contributing to society [1] still seems to champion what a majority (?) of people can at least see is outdated. I can imagine recipients descended from slaves, charity workers in places we historically destroyed, people who work in democratic institutions etc. being unhappy with good reason.

It seems likely [2] to turn people off an institution meant to knit the UK together, and I can see plenty of opportuntities for change, like the creation of the modern commonwealth in the 50s or in 2004 when a select committee recommended a different system [3].

Anyone know why no govt has ever switched to The Order of British Excellence, or The Order of the Commonwealth?

I know Hazard is considered an up and coming ""world-class"" talent, yet he still is not considered to be on the level of Ronaldo/Mess/even Neymar (yes i know he is younger). James I believe is a bit overrated and could be a superstar bench player at madrid. Now I know buying the most expensive players in the world does not always come to fruition (Ie. Torres, Shevchenko), but do you think Chelsea needs a Ronaldo/Messi to be considered one of the best clubs in the world?

TL;DR Does chelsea need a big name superstar (Suarez, Ronaldo, Messi) to compete with the Real and Barca?

I'm a analyst for Copenhagen Wolves (LoL pro team) so i understand the MOBA genre really well, just need to learn DOTA as i repsect that it's an entirely different game. 

I enjoy playing role 4 (Jungle/Roaming Support) as i love being the big teamfight and initiator in a game! Can also play Hard support and Hard Carry (i suck at mid :( ).

If you want to play a few games add me on steam!

Reina: We shoiuld sell right now while we could still get some money for him.

Jones: Not good enough.

Kelly: 24 years old, injuries have ruined the oppurtunity for him to become a proper LFC player.

Kolo Toure: Too old and not good enough.

Lucas: With Emre Can that just came in and Joe Allen, we should sell him while LFC still can make some money off him. Harsh, I know.

Borini: 14m for a player, that would be favored behind Surridge, Remy, Lambert and Origi after his loan. This would be the best choice for his career.

Joao Teixeira: He's 21 and probably wont get many chances over Coutinho, Sterling, Markovic and etc. It would be the best choice for his career.

Assaidi: Let's be honest his LFC career just never worked out.

LOAN:

Jordan Ibe: Looks like a talent, he should go to a mid table PL club.

Suso: I honestly feel like it's his last chance to impress, this time he should go to a PL club.

Illori: Needs one more season on loan, to get some game time.

Origi: A loan to Lille seems to be part of the deal to bring him to LFC.

BUY:

Remy, Lovren and Origi all look like they're coming and we already know about the signings we made earlier in the transfer market.

Ochoa: Great back-up keeper choice and might even give Mignolet a run for his money.

Moreno: A talented Spanish left back that would be our starting left back for years to come.

Manqulio: It's a loan and Flannagan, Johnson aren't that good to be honest, it's a low risk and high reward situation.

Isco or Antoinne Greizmann: Both are two young proven stars that would walk into the LFC starting 11 and could possibly take the no. 7 kit.

Me and my father are looking into buying houses in bad state, refurbishing them and reselling.
My father is an exceptionally good all around builder, so we got the tools, and we can finish huge amounts of work in a very short time, the main issue is the money, ofcourse.

So we have a few things that we need some insight on.


1. Should we buy in London or outside of London (we're living in London)?
2. What steps do we take to choose the best, most promising area in London/outside of London
3. Where do you get the initial money from in order to start everything off, (300k~), do you take a bank loan? If so, how hard is it to get one?
4. Any other things we should know?


Any comments are very appreciated and we're very grateful to anyone that contributes !

So basically, I'm from Toronto, Canada and my girlfriend is moving to London for 12 months to do her MSc with the possibility of staying longer (but that's another topic).
Essentially, I would like to go and see her 3-4 times in the period of September - September for one to two weeks each and need it to be as cheap as possible.
She will be staying in the Romford area (Harold Wood to be a little more precise), so I'm looking to stay as close to that area as possible.
I've checked hotels, B&amp;B's, AirBNB, and hostels in and around London; I've also checked the Wiki on the sidebar, and have done Reddit and Google searches but nothing comes out significantly cheap in the long run.
So I would like to get some advice from some of you who live there and know the place better than someone who has never been.

Some common questions regarding depth seem to be: How many players do you need in each position? How do you account for players that play multiple positions? With players being able to play different positions, sometimes it can be difficult to see where the squad is lacking. Well I think I’ve got the answers.
 
Just to be clear, this post is talking about numbers of players in a squad. Quality of those players is another matter altogether. 
 
My theory is based on a simple math equation (bear with me): For any group of X number of positions, a squad needs (2X+1) players, minimum. Basically I'm saying any one position needs 3 competent players. Any 2 positions need at least 5 players; any 3 positions need 7 players, and so on. 
 
This simple formula lets you evaluate a team’s depth not only in any one position, but also in groups of positions. For example, if I were to tell someone unfamiliar with LFC that at Left Back we had 3 players, (Enrique, Flanagan, Johnson) that sounds like adequate cover. This perceived depth is misleading; we all know that Flanagan and Johnson also play at Right Back, where we also have 3 players, (Johnson, Flanagan, Kelly).
 
Individually, the two positions look like they are well covered; and according to my formula above, we need 3 players per position. Looking at the two positions as a group, changes the outcome.
 
At both LB and RB we have only 4 players. According to my formula we need 5 players for two positions to be adequately covered. So I’d conclude that we are short one Full Back. One signing for either left or right back would fill the squad nicely. (Once the squad is full you can start discussing the need to upgrade players individually. But be careful, if we replace Johnson with a RB that isn’t versatile enough to play on the left as well, suddenly we are short at LB. In this case we would need to replace Johnson with two players.)
 
This formula can also highlight a squad depth problem another way. Let’s look at our typical 4-3-3 formation, specifically the front line of 3 players.
 
To play across the front three we have the following:
 
-       Sturridge
-       Lambert
-       Sterling
-       Ibe
-       Markovic
-       Lallana
-       Remy
 
This looks good, we have 7 players for 3 positions, as my formula expects. But here we have a case of looking at the big picture too soon. Breaking it down into Wide Forwards we have:
 
-       Sterling
-       Ibe
-       Markovic
-       Lallana
-       Remy
 
5 players for two positions is ideal. Most of these players can play either side, so I won’t break it down further at this point.
 
At Striker, we only have Sturridge and Lambert. This tells me we need a central striker. If Remy can cover this position (I honestly don’t know enough about him), then we’ve got enough depth up front.
 
 
I’m enjoying this so let's look at our three man midfield now. We have one deep mid position and two central mid positions. No distinction will be applied to the two CMs as anyone who can play LCM can play RCM in my mind. 
(I’m not familiar with all our new players. I've made some assumptions on where they can play.)
 
In the Deep Mid position we have:
- Gerrard
- Can
- Lucas
 
3 for 1. All set. 
 
At CM, we have 2 positions to fill:
- Henderson
- Coutinho
- Allen
- Can
- Lucas
 
Good, that's five. (Can we add Lallana to this list? Maybe, I'm not sure. I've also left off Suso, as Brendan doesn't seem to rate him). 
 
So no one position is light in central midfield. But we have some overlap with Can and Lucas. So looking at the three positions together, what does our depth look like? 
 
By my math we have 6 players for those 3 positions. One short of my formula. Suso could make up the seventh player, or Lallana (but again I'm not sure about them). If you place Lallana in both the Wide Forward group and the CM group, then we need to look at the combined depth of those positions.
 
These examples display the advantage of applying this formula in that it covers off 2 distinct situations where the perceived depth can be misleading. 
 
You can have individual positions with enough depth but looking at a bigger picture, the squad is short. Inversely you can seem to have proper coverage over multiple positions, but when looked at closely, one individual position is short. 
 
I know some of this just seems like common sense, but I like to put some logic to my arguments, and this gives me a basis for claiming we are short at full back and striker. This also highlights the reasoning why Rodgers may not want to try to replace a versatile player like Johnson, even if his form has dropped; or why we bought Remy over Bony, as he is (allegedly) more versatile.
 
I really just hope this starts a good discussion on squad depth.

At the very least it would give me a sense of completion over the whole thing!

On Wikipedia it says that two years of university is equivalent to a DipHe but I'm not clear if this means the uni has to award you that level qualification or not: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DipHE

Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: I'm not going to finish the degree, as I said I'm now studying to be a nurse instead so it's not even relevant to what I want to do in the future. It would just be nice to have something to show for the work I did, especially since I appear to be entitled to it.

Edit II: Denied. Apparently it is the ""full award or none"" despite the fact I have friends at other unis who got CertHEs for degrees they didn't complete.

**I didn't ask for any number. I was happy to be given any number. It is a special number and I was made up when they said you’re number 9. That [points to LFC badge] is what means the most to me. Any number with that on, I'll be happy with it.**

-------------------------------

‘My first reaction at the time (when my agent rang) was something along the lines of “get lost”,’ said Lambert, referring to the phone call that turned his world upside down in May. ‘I didn't believe him at first. When I got out of bed properly and listened I realised it was genuine.

‘But now I have to get picked, progress with the club and impress the manager. That’s what matters. Obviously when I look back over my career I’ll never forget my time at all my clubs who mean a lot to me, but I'm thinking I have to think about what I do from now.’

And sure, he lost a lot of companions, and a couple he could never get back, but we just need to see someone die right in front of him. Capaldi needs to be directly responsible for someone's death, preferably Clara's. I know this may sound cruel, but hear me out. Clara as a companion brought nothing to the table in Series 7 Part 2. Unlike someone like Rose who was disobedient but always necessary, Clara has always been the good girl. She was good in Asylum of the Daleks and the Snowmen, but in the recent episodes, she just adopted Smith's personality and way of thinking. This will be fantastic in Series 8, though, because she will represent the huge contrast in the Doctor's methods from Smith to Capaldi, as she still thinks like Smith, and this visual demonstration illustrates this internal struggle the Doctor should be having and adopting it to TV rather than writing about these thoughts like in a book. She will hopefully become a much better companion and really be what Capaldi needs to interact with people. But eventually they will replace her, and also they will want to take advantage of Capaldi's acting experience and talent. And at this point in the series, the Doctor needs something new to feel guilty about. This coupled with the new darker theme, and it would seem the best choice would be to have Clara straight up die. This would allow for the whole Impossible Girl storyline to be more conclusively wrapped up, and on the Doctor's new travels, he may keep looking for another version of Clara, who may never come. And unlike late Smith who got all depressed, Capaldi should get ANGRY. But not straight up lose it for a whole season as much as give death stares to everyone. Like when he's not losing it, it looks like he's right on the brink of doing so. I want to see an explosive Doctor.

I feel that it is very important for us as an club to look at life beyond Gerrard or we may run into an similar situation to Man United with Scholes. I also feel that a midfield of Lallana/Coutinho, Henderson and Allen/Can provides with greater mobility and pressing. This midfield combination also seems more viable in the long term.

This season will see with at least 6 more games which may further degrade Gerrard's conditioning. Having Gerrard being rotated more would allow for a higher peak performance.
