I had to physically shove a driver out of the office tonight, followed by a lot of noisy shouting and physical aggression.

And this was an hour or two after another driver had graciously and fulsomely introduced himself and said what a good chap I was. Some people are difficult to please.

Grr.

First off, I'm aware this may be the wrong subreddit to post to for this, but /r/England didn't seem to be too popular (x-posting this, though).  Apologies if so!

My partner (girlfriend) and I are from SC in the states, both recently graduated.  She is obtaining her Master's from UoN to work in Public History (museums, sites, etc.) and her aim is to stay within England after graduating.

Without all the details, we plan for me to join her after she graduates, though we're not sure how to go about that outside of marriage (not our preferred choice).

Would anyone here happen to have any solid places to look for information, or have any advice that may be helpful?  

Thank you!

I'm asking this because i'm from the Former Yugoslavia and as you might have heard, the whole independence thing didn't go very swimmingly with some of the Republics.

2. What happens to the Royal estates in Scotland? (if any)

3. Will they keep their current laws or draft an entirely new constitution?

4. If I'm not mistaken, Scotland is in a union with England and Wales, forming Great Britain, if Scotland does indeed gain independence they leave the union, right? 

5. will they become a member of the Commonwealth like Canada and Australia?

UGC is FREE to join and is available for anyone in the regions of Africa, Asia, AUS/NZ, Europe, Middle East, North and South America!

We are a brand new amateur league dedicated for all skill levels. We have seperate divisions based on your team's average MMR. In other words, your team will be able to compete against other teams that are similar to your skill level!

Our Dota 2 league has hard-working staff. Every week, your team is available to be casted (in any division!). We also have a supportive administrative team. If you have a problem, our admins are easily contactable. Through either Steam or IRC.
BUT, that's not all!

Since we will be having different divisions, our top division will have a $2,000 base prize pool! A little over £1200!
We will also be having an in-game ticket for our tournament matches.

The plan must have been to see if he could bed into the squad and become our number 10 or be sold for a profit when the time was appropriate. Unfortunately he arrived 6 months early and we were able to land Eriksen in the window he was supposed to show up. 

Now I don't think anyone will tell you that Holtby is a better player than Eriksen. Especially with Eriksen being younger. However I think if they had both arrived in the same window Holtby's thought process would have been significantly different, thinking he was competing for a spot rather than having been replaced in one. 

Lewis wanted first team minutes and so he was loaned out again, and likely won't come back. That sucks but he's a good enough player to start games, its a shame he had to leave Tottenham to do so. Especially due to the fact he was at a better German club when he came then the one he's off to now. Most of us will miss him dearly. 

Here's a question for the comment section: Did Levy make a mistake putting all his eggs in the Eriksen basket?

I work for a company based in Sydney, Australia and they have asked if I was willing to got to the UK for a period of up to 6 months to help our business/office located in the UK. My role will require a lot of travelling around the UK (London, Manchester, Northern Ireland, Bidford, Cambridge etc) but I was hoping to base myself out of London for obvious reasons. 
  
I have recently applied for a business visitor visa and hopefully that will be accepted and come through this week as I have planned to fly out the following week.   

Now, I was hoping to find a flat with a 6 month lease or no term lease in London and then conduct my business activities wherever I need to be but always have the security of a place to come back to within London for weekends etc. Now I have currently just seen this on [lawfirmuk](http://www.lawfirmuk.net/business_e.html) and [ukpermits](http://www.ukpermits.com/visa-types/business-visas) - **B. Activities not permitted on a business visitor visa -** *You must be based abroad and have no intention of setting up a base in the UK*.   
  
So, I have no intention of setting up a long term ""base"" past the 6 months, but my question is: Does signing for (can I even) a flat on a short term/6 month lease not allowed based on that statement? Or does it simply mean I cannot buy a house or something like that?

The other question I had was around **B. Activities not permitted on a business visitor visa -** *You must not intend to live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits*.

But then I thought, why not the rest of them? A weeping angel? Madame Vastra?! Make it look like the TARDIS?? I could paint the whole Whoverse on them if I set my mind to it. (I also have the BBC Sherlock gang on my list, and many other superheroes/villians)

I don't currently have an example besides my Ninja Turtle but would anyone be interested in buying one if I were to sell? I can do 3 (or 4) different sizes, from mini to large. I seal them with a polyurethane coating to insure it lasts for a lifetime. If people want to see a Doctor Who example, I could probably start on one this weekend to do a little show and tell.

Since we are 18, we just graded and have lived at home, so no references. We are coming over with a good amount of support funds, which could help because a letting agent who has been helping us told us that we would have to pay 3 months advance instead of references. We worry that we can afford a place now but once we get a job we won't be able to afford it. 
Lets just say as an example, both of us get full time waitressing jobs, would we be able to afford a flat that is 595 pounds a month? This is the price of a two bedroom place we were sent images of by this letting agent. She also told us apparently you aren't allowed to rent a 1 bedroom if you are not a couple, is this always true? we would share the room, not make the living room a bedroom too.
And is Edinburgh just made up of these small areas? It's different from what we are used to. Do all these small areas connect to City Centre, cause we want to be as close as possible, but not too close cause the price obviously, but close enough to take a train or bus there within 10-15 min or so.

I don't like to watch the MLS, and instead watch mostly national games, and any games I can catch in The Premier League. The problem is, I find that watching a league without a favorite team, that I can really get behind, is tiresome. After looking at different teams, and playing around with Fifa 14. I have found that Everton will be my choice as my favorite and the team I will continuously follow, in good times and bad for the rest of my life. I am very eager and committed to being a fan.

I have already started to learn about the history and motto of the team, I really like what I have read up on and look forward to learning more. I don't have any problem finding information. 

What I want to know, is there anything I should know about Everton FC? Something I can't really come across on my own? I am also curious about the fan base, that's why I am asking here directly, what are you guys like? Traditions? If you guys could let me know on anything, it would be greatly appreciated. 

I also want to see your responses and see how friendly this group is.
Maybe some great videos, who are the top members of the organization, and team. Also what you disagree within Everton, I want to know anything that a fan should know and would want to know.

Thank you!

Fun Fact About me, I am a huge Indianapolis Colts Fan, I became a Fan in 2003 when the Colts Came back against the Bucs. 38-35. Even when the Colts are losing bad, I don't stop watching and will watch the whole game and I follow every game thoroughly. Plan on doing the same with Everton. Plus the Team Colors match pretty well! :D

Edit: Thanks guys for the responses, this really helps out!

Edit 2: I think I have gotten what I can, after finding out that there was a new fan thread, I think I am good with everything. I really appreciate everyone's enthusiasm and hospitality, everyone's responses were helpful, thank you all! If any new fans read this, going to  /u/Halt_I_Am_Ragnar's thread over [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/29bs6z/new_evertonians/) is the best way to learn everything instead of making a new thread.

The big clubs are under so much pressure to perform well that they don't have time for players to develop they immediately buy some one without using those players. A potential talent just sitting there being wasted.

I dont care about statistics, I mean obviously they have value, but thye seem pointless if you don't give players a chance.


These reports of selling suso kind of hurts me. The player performed really well last season in la liga and doesnt even make the bench.

Wisdom another very good powerful player although has been given to west brom on loan for some premier league experience im just afraid that he might be sold at a lower price later on to some low level club without giving him a chance in the first team.

Conor Coady was decent but i think there was just too much competition in the midfield.


Jack Dunn, Ryan Mclaughlin, Samed Yesil (have high hopes for him), Jordan Ibe, Joao Carlos Teixeira these are all great potential talents we should groom them and if they have a good loan spell use em in the next season. A very tough competition, money involved and the frustrating impatience does not allow them time on the pitch but it should. 

But im glad to see flanno and sterling make thier way into the first team and establish themselves. Rodgers is a brilliant coach he wants to use youth but his hands are always tied because of the pressure and well impatience from the players too. I think Borini's stance of not going anywhere and fighting for his place (only time will tell if he is good or not) is respectful, i mean this was Rodger's first buy apart from getting injured and getting very less time we cant say ooo hes shit, give him time on the pitch and see. I mean aspas was shit no doubt but we need to give young players time on the pitch.


Luis alberto, Thiago Illori they seem wonderful potentials. GIVE THEM TIME, our fans are so welcoming to the young players but its this evil money making business that wont let it happen.  I mean in the past we have used so many players  Billy Liddell, Ronnie Moran, Ian Callaghan, Phil Thompson, Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman, Michael Owen, Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard all came for the academy.


Rodgers and Our owners have a very bright vision but the modern game wont give em time. Lastly to the acdemy players and graduates prove your worth and play for the club dont lose focus and when given a chance, BRING IT.

I know that he first meets in the Daleks in S1 .. shouldn't miss that! ..haha

S1 Serials:
An Unearthly Child,
The Daleks,
The Edge of Destruction,
Marco Polo(I believe these episodes are still missing),
The Keys of Marinus,
The Aztecs,
The Sensorites,
The Reign of Terror(2 episodes missing)

What do I need that will be referenced in the future/ which serials are plain out enjoyable ?

Well.. thanks in advance.

Scotland wouldn't plan to be fully independent until 2016 so do they get to vote in 2015?

If they do then the result of a majority vote would change a year later when all Scottish MPs no longer count.

If they don't, a nation would be denied access to a democratic vote that would still be relevant to them for 12 months.

I've heard some suggestions that the GE could be postponed until 2016 when the new UK could vote but this doesn't seem like a goer. There already seems like a feeling for a change of government without them hanging on for an unprecedented sixth year.

What do you think the options could be. I've heard very little coverage of this.

Firstly there is a general attitude of doom-mongering amongst the 'No' campaign, the arguments against independence boil down to Scotland will be worse off without England, Scotland can't make it on their own, Scotland will fail without English support. I disagree with these attitudes simply because this will be the single greatest challenge to face this country in most of our lifetimes, a yes vote would actually force England and Scotland to work together in a way that we never have. A failing Scotland would have massive negative impact on people in both countries so we simply can't let it fail. 

Also, I think that relationships between the Scots and the English would actually improve after a Yes vote, Scots would no longer feel like the junior partner, the poor relation, and the English would not be dismissive of Scotland as a quaint back-water of the British isles. 

finally, it would be a massive shake up to the stagnant political establishment. The actual infrastructure of British politics has barely changed in a hundred years, the last major upheaval was Irish independence at the start of the 1900's and that actually had minimal impact on English politics and the way that we ran our country. A Scottish 'Yes' vote could cause a major shake up of how we, the English decide to govern ourselves, already there is serious talk of a 'North of England' assembly and increased regional devolution in Wales. Perhaps the Scottish independence could kickstart a new wave of debate and discussion amongst the English and result in greater distribution of power to local political institutions, it could revitalise English democracy by bringing the people closer to the decision making process.

TL;DR a 'Yes' vote is good for England because we will be forced to reassess our own stagnant political institutions.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Why I think Scots should vote 'Yes',4,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2fw1lp/why_i_think_scots_should_vote_yes/

We (Updata Infrastructure Ltd) have a continual requirement for hiring
for the position of Technical Solutions Engineer. It’s our top level
of engineer expertise that design and build large scale service
provider networks. This is the team that I work in so I can answer
questions on what life's like working at Updata, general questions
about the company, how we do things etc. I can answer general question
about the position too but not regarding benefits and contract details
of course. You can also reach me on james.bensley@updata.net.

Updata is under rapid expansion and we're continually hiring - as per
the advert we're a leader in PSN networking and winning business left,
right and centre. We're on the lookout for people who can think for
themselves; yes you will be asked technical questions during the
interview process about networking but you also need to be able to
apply logical process to challenges when using technologies foreign to
you.

There is a job positing on line:
http://careers.peopleclick.com/careerscp/client_capita/external/en_US/jobDetails.do?functionName=getJobDetail&amp;jobPostId=124808&amp;localeCode=en-us

I know there is no salary range on that job posting which everyone
loves to complain about. HR write the advert not me but be assured
it’s going to be anything form £30k to £50k as it is obviously
depending on the candidate - bottom line is if you have the skills
you'll be paid for them.

Cheers,

I living in Krasnodar and I support LFC. But Im not a troll. I want to help you to know something about Krasnodar FC. 

Krasnodar FC is a new born football club. It was founded in 2008 by Sergey Galitsky. 
Krasnodar FC is unique club for Russia. They have a rich owner but they goes another way than Chelsea, ManCity, Zenit or Anji. They like Amsterdam Ajax. 

The club want to educate talented young players, rather than buying ready-made stars. They built a football academy and successfully teach children.
Fabio Capello has said that this is the best football Academy that he had seen. 

FC Krasnodar have not a lot of true fans because club is 6 years old. But I think we will see a full stadium in Krasnodar.

I think it will be nice game against Everton. FC Krasnodar plays in open football. They want play in creative football for fans. 

Now I read that Everton fans don't came to Russia on this match. Im so sad about that. Krasnodar is a nice city. We love football here and especially now when we starts in European football.

You can ask me about football or Russia or something else

ps. 
Sorry for my mistakes. 
Best regards for neighbors

I'm self-employed living in the UK.

I have multiple invoices awaiting payment from my employers, all of them late. This has put pressure on my overdraft. Seeing that I was close to my limit I called HSBC on Saturday to ensure that I was not going to go over my limit with any pending payments etc. I was advised of the amount I'd have available once all pending transactions were taken from my account. I was content that this amount was sufficient to see me through until I received payment from my outstanding invoices.

Today I awoke to see that I am over my overdraft limit. I phone HSBC who inform me of two direct debits taken from my account on Sunday. I was informed that the original advisor would have known about these impending DD's and I should have been advised about them.

Financially I am going to get out of this unscathed. The bank waived the default fee (£25) and I will be receiving one of my outstanding invoice payments later today. However, I really don't want this brief excursion over my overdraft to effect my credit rating (I've been a good boy for years). If I had been advised correctly on Saturday I would have taken action to prevent going over my limit, after all, that was the entire purpose of my call to HSBC in the first place. HSBC informed me that they refer to external credit agencies when I apply for loans etc so there is no point in them putting a comment on my account to say I went over my limit due to poor advice, so what can I do?

The damage to the Union has been done. 

Quebec had two referendums on ""sovereignty"" in the 20th century and lost both of them. That has not stopped the PQ from bringing up ""sovereignty"" in almost every provincial election. 

This is probably going to be the first of many referendums on secession. Most serious statisticians predict that the No side will win, which is predictable. In close polls like this, the status quo side usually wins by voting day. 

Even though the No side will probably win, Scotland will pay the price for its disloyalty the same way Quebec did. Quebec separatism damaged firms' confidence in the stability of Quebec, making many [relocate to Toronto from Montreal](http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html). Every time there is a referendum, the Canadian Dollar also decreases in value for a time. 

I see a lot of the same delusions in Scotland that Quebec has. Both polities are more left wing than the rest of their country, both expect a [currency union after separation](http://o.canada.com/news/national/dream-on-pauline-marois-who-would-want-such-an-unstable-partner-in-a-currency-union), and both are led by bombastic nationalists.

The only thing that will kill this separatism permanently is globalization and immigration. People with recent immigration backgrounds do not support the PQ nearly as much as the Quebecois do and [UK immigrants tend to identify as British](http://www.res.org.uk/details/mediabrief/1452073/Immigrants-Ready-Assimilation-Of-British-Identity-Suggests-We-Need-Not-Fear-A-Cu.html), not Scottish. This will cause the separatist movement to gradually lose support and fade away. 

I know that many of you think that the 'silence from Westminster is deafening,' but they are taking the right approach. It is important not to be aggressive with separatists because that only feeds the persecution complex of their voter base. Calmly and rationally argue for the Union and you will make progress. 

Currently, Quebec separatism is at an [all time low after decades of federalist effort.](http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/04/13/did_the_1995_referendum_kill_quebec_separatism.html) Quebec [may even sign the constitution soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2fokmm/to_clarify_the_quebec_premier_wants_to_sign_the/)

I've emailed my local council but haven't heard back yet. Calling them is just a phone tree, and their visiting hours are tough for me with my job. I may eventually have to visit them.

So, my question:

I am only in the UK until very beginning of January, but I have received my council tax bill that calculates the period of the year until the end of March 2015. I had deductions from March 2014-August 2014, so the bill is for now until end of March 2015. Am I right in assuming I will only have to pay for my time actually in my flat—September to when I leave in January? 

Does my bill change when I choose to pay monthly? It shows my deductions based on the 10 month payment cycle, but will my balance change when I switch to 12 monthly payments?

Essentially, I definitely want to make sure I pay monthly so that I don’t ‘overpay’ for the Feb/March months, when I won’t even be in the flat/country. I will of course pay what is rightly due.

Thank you kindly in advance for your advice.

I'm a 21 year old male from Hungary. I started studying at a university when I was 18, then I realized that it was not what I wanted to study, so I left and changed. Now I'm 21 without a diploma/degree and also I have 3 years left if I want to graduate.

This isn't that bad yet. The bad thing comes now: I have only one free semester at the university (the current one), because of the current law, which says if you don't manage to graduate, you have to pay for every semester spent at the university, but if you manage to graduate, you MUST work in Hungary for the same amount of days/semesters that your education took. That means you can't just go abroad.

In my country the people are mostly poor... The minimal wage is brutto 101.000 HUF (Hungarian Forint) which equals about £260. I've been working from March to September this year after I left the university, usually averaging 13 hours a day (4 days a week, from Tuesday to Friday), so actually I know what hard work is and being tired like every day. I've been earning about netto 70-80.000 HUF per month (£180-£200), cause I only had to pay 16% tax (student work).

Living here is not easy. I mean let's say I finish the university and I get a job. I can't just move from my parents cause I don't have the money for it. What about family? What about buying a car or anything else? Vacation? I've literally never been on a vacation. Never.

I have a few months to decide whatever I want to do with my life. I've been thinking about going abroad, and my choice would be the United Kingdom since I've only learnt English as a foreign language. I know if I manage to get there, I will have a shitty job and the start will be very hard, but as I said, I know what hard work is. If I would decide to leave my country and try my luck in the UK, I would have to go back to work instead of studying to save money to start my hopefully new life.

I've never even been abroad so I don't know much about the life in other countries, but I've been reading a lot about England lately. That's my huge dilemma right now, and I would ask you guys to give me some advices and some information about living in England as a foreigner. How is the life there? What about racism?

I'm looking for a new bag for Uni to replace my old rucksack. I'm trying to look a bit more professional and put together these days (I'm teaching staff as well as a student).

Has anyone got any suggestions? I would happily spend up to £150 for something that is going to last.

I need it to be able to hold quite a lot of stuff. And my walk to work is about 45 minutes so it needs to hold up to quite a lot of use.

Including... my technology (a 13inch MacBook Pro, my iPAd, my iPhone - yes, I'm an Apple fanboy, my kindle). My notebook and pencil case. An A4 plastic folder. My lunch. A bottle of water. A small makeup bag. My wallet and keys. An umbrella. And if there is extra space for the occasional text book, that would be wonderful. Though, I usually use a canvas bag for those if I need to.

The bag has to have a zip top. I live in Yorkshire, rain is an issue.

A friend of mine has recently bought a car from a private seller (was category D, but had been repaired). A week later he had a minor issue with the mirrors, so he took it to a local garage to be fixed.

When they jacked the car up, they found that underneath it was a mess - certainly not road worthy, it hasn't been fixed properly at all. The accident on it's history was in 2011, but it passed it's MOT in May of this year. So there's two possibilities - it's been crashed and bodged since the MOT, or there's something a bit underhand going on with the garage that's giving the MOTs out. 

He's spent over 3k and the people he's bought it off aren't picking up the phone. The police aren't interested as they say it's a civil matter. He's been in touch with citizens advice, and I think that's ongoing. Should have had it inspected before he bought it I know!

I remember him saying something along the lines of ""it's a shared history, but it's so much more than that!!!"" In fact, he was furious with these genetic copies being referred to as anything but. Well I suppose something changed along the lines for the doctor because he completely contradicts himself in the later episodes with the flesh. When the crew argues that the flesh are not really the people they copy he argues that they have all the same memories and feelings so why shouldn't they be treated the same as real people? He also talks about it more as a kind of life is a miracle no matter what and so the flesh should be helped sort of way. To bring it up, there are some differences. For instance, Jenny and the others were made from DNA samples out of who knows what whereas the flesh, as the doctor points out, is a living thing on it's own that takes the shape of the people. So I suppose there is the difference between a complete fabrication and a sort of mirror image.

Hoorah Bank holidays...

**""[A review of the Romeo y Julieta Wide Churchill – By a cigar new-guy](https://imgur.com/a/KnqGH)**

Howdo /r/cigars[1] from a brother across the pond, upon the great rainy monday of the United Kingdom. I'm a fairly new guy to cigar smoking but I've started picking up on tastes, smells and textures of cigars. So I'd like to have a crack at a new guy's review of the cigars I've shared already this week... if that's okay with you all anyway!

Monday this week is bank holiday in the U.K. (free day off work... wooh!) as ever, it's raining, absolutely pissing it down in Leicester but that doesn't stop me from smoking something I've been really looking forward to. Grabbed a new book I've got and in typical British fashion I had a cup of Yorkshire Gold tea to go with it... quite sugary as I wasn't aiming to die of nicotine afterwards which I did recently on a Cohiba Siglo IV (Point and laugh, please... my better half certainly did)

First Impressions: Damn these things are hefty, 55 gauge glory sticks made of pure Cuban greatness. Great construction and a very strong smell of tabacco at the foot of the cigar. Easy to light (I use a turbo-flame) and very quick to get going... even amongst the rain and wind of my apartment balcony. Love the nice smooth texture of the cigar with some nice lines to break it up, double band sits comfortably on the cigar with the “WIDE CHURCHILL” being wrapped very tightly (I have yet to remove one in one piece!)

First Third: As I said, Lit very easily with no need for a good toasting, very good draw and lots of white smoke bellowing from the foot after every sweet puff. Lots of great tastes for peanuts and what I could swear was cashews, maybe even walnut?

Second Third: Started getting some uneven burn, but after learning a few things from you guys I soon got that under control (to a point!)... from what I understand this isn't anything unexpected on such a large cigar? Still retained some of that really strong nutty tastes and towards the end of this third I could certainly taste some leathery after-tastes from each puff. Really enjoyed this part the most!

Last Third: Can't really change my review of the last third as she kept going out and I lost the tower of ash that I'd be cultivating for a good 45-50 minutes at this point! Strong leathery tastes as well as the all the way through nuts. Got a strange and almost overpowering raw-tabacco taste as I neared the nubbing section with the stick finally dying quietly as I forgot to move my finger and now have a lovely burn mark.

Essentially the situation is that my bank in error attributed a bad debt to me, when infact this account was not mine. This error was then passed onto Experian, Call Credit and Equifax and at the time caused me to have a poor credit rating.

I contacted my bank when I found out about this and the bank paid compensation and endeavoured to have my file amended. The bank contacted all 3 credit agencies and instructed them that this was a mistake made by the bank and that this information was wrong.

Experian and Call credit responded very quickly to remove the information. Equifax did not. As time passed equifax report still showed no update. I contacted both the bank and equifax...now multiple times to try to resolve this.

Equifax are absolutely adament that their information is correct, my bank have tried vigorously from their end to call and email Equifax and update their systems to show the correct information.

Equifax however remain steadfast in their assessment that this wrong information is correct and are point blank refusing to update my credit score - this is despite being the only party of 4 involved that is doing this.

What can I do to force Equifax to comply?...this situation is really really tedious and has now cost me in excess of £20,000 in lost income, as my borrowing has been curtailed because of this and continues to be.

 For the developers among you, I had a meeting with the software team yesterday and found out from them the kinds of tech/languages/experience they like to see from applicants. So, if you've got experience with:
* node.js

then get in touch if you'd like to see what's up with Sky!

Anyway, onto today's live roles. I'm looking for two things specifically, and I'd love to see the opportunities go to people from this community.

First up, I'm recruiting for a shift manager to work at the Sky Offices in Brick Lane, for Sky Network Operations. See part of the spec below:

So I've got this idea:

Whether or not they have meant to, every companion(/actor) has shown up in an episode of doctor who previous to them becoming an ""official"" companion. With the exception, of course, of Rose Tyler who had no episodes previous to her companionship with the Doctor (she did, however, show up in episodes after her companionship when she was trapped in the [parallel universe](http://i.imgur.com/ojoTOA8.jpg)). Martha Jones (or Freema Agyeman at least) showed up in [this episode](http://i.imgur.com/LjU5pWO.jpg) with Tennant, in which she was one of the first victims of the cybermen. Donna Noble showed up as [""the bride""](http://i.imgur.com/9tCremr.jpg) immediately after the Doctor's goodbye to rose and a full season before she was a companion. Karen Gillan was a [soothsayer in Pompeii](http://i.imgur.com/AalIGgn.jpg) in one of Donna Noble's early episodes as a companion. Not to mention [River Song](http://i.imgur.com/qXvIsS0.jpg) who shows up whenever the hell she wants. And, famously, Clara Oswald had been spread across the Doctor's personal timeline showing up in episodes with [daleks](http://i.imgur.com/0DfIsV3l.jpg) and [snowmen](http://i.imgur.com/hUlr8q0.jpg) in future and past iterations of herself. 

Why is any of this important? Well, I think we've already been introduced to the next companion. Remember [this heartbreaking scene](http://i.imgur.com/QQCZfdT.jpg) from a week ago? The Doctor explicitly said the only reason he wouldn't bring her along was because she was a soldier.

But the Doctor has already left Journey Blue behind, so what will change his mind?  Easy. [This guy](http://i.imgur.com/mpIZBi1.jpg). Danny Pink has already shown that he is [different from the Doctor's idea of soldiers](http://i.imgur.com/ZGUWSoOh.jpg) and it has been reported that he will be joining Clara in her travels.

I think Danny Pink is going to change the Doctor's mind about soldiers and show him that they aren't just mindless drones that follow orders. Once he realizes that he may have judged her too harshly, I think the Doctor will come back for Journey Blue and allow her to travel with him.

Tl;Dr: we've already met the next companion

I've recently started a football blog called ""Planet Goodison"" dedicated to the club I love, Everton FC (don't kick me out just yet).

You can find the blog right here: http://planetgoodison.com/

I think it'd be a cool feature for the blog to have a guest post each week from a supporter of the club we are about to play.

It just so happens we are one week away from kickoff of Everton vs. West Brom. So my question for all of you at r/wbafootball is, would anyone like to be the next contributor to Planet Goodison's ""View from the Visiting End"" series?

Your post could be as long or short as you'd like but I think a great goal would be somewhere between 400-500 words.

Also, I really want you to focus on your club's players (who had a great international break/who might have picked up a knock in the previous games) as well as formations, trends, etc.

I'll look for those elements so that I (and other Everton supporters) can get a better sense of the team we're about to play.

Each post should contain a little bit about Everton as well, who you guys feel is the player that needs to be stopped or who can be exploited.

Of course I'm always open to a little bit of trash talk as well.

I'm sure you will all have plenty of thoughts on Lukaku or Victor Anichebe, two guys we know very well.

You will receive all the credit for your work (unfortunately no compensation because I don't write well enough to get paid) and I will give you plenty of shout outs on twitter and soccer forums to my dozens of followers (it's still a new blog, have to grow the fan base).

Let me know if you are interested!

I like the new Doctor, but it seems like the plots are focused on making a point rather than telling a good story.

My issue is that the stories, for lack of a better phrase, are dumbed down. Instead of letting us learn about the Doctor's internal conflicts through the story and through the Doctor's actions, we have them spoonfed to us through dialogue.

The Daleks are just boring now -- honestly, they've been used so many times before that I just don't care about a good one or an evil one, even if it's being used as a metaphor.

If they'd shown the Doctor throwing the robot out of his ship instead of leaving it up to the viewer to decide what happened, it would have made a stronger statement about him and later, when he asks Clara ""Am I a good man?"" the question would have been more relevant.

The entire Robin Hood scenario was just irritating and although I suspend disbelief 1000 times per episode, this one was just stupid.

The archery contest -- really? The doctor put homing devices in the tips of the arrows? When? *WHY?* Did he anticipate he'd need to shoot later?

And omfg, they knock the ship out of orbit by shooting it with a gold arrow? Seriously? That's just lazy writing. 

The Doctor and Robin Hood are arguing like children? Really? 

Instead of writing Robin Hood as cartoonish, why not write him as the gritty, unwashed outlaw, who aspires to be the man history thinks he is?

Instead of writing Clara as a star-struck Bieber-fan, why not write her as disappointed by the man she encounters but who believes again when Robin Hood shows true heroism?

And WTF is up with the school teacher she asks out on a date? Why spend a big chunk of an episode on a character when we never see him again? I guess he'll show up later, but by then, I probably won't care.

I re-watched the Girl in the Fireplace the other night and it hit me hard how brilliant the writing was and how well-crafted the stories were. 

What happened?

Something Capaldi was saying struck me as possibly either a hint about the Doctors regeneration process. He's looking in a mirror, or maybe it's the scene with the tramp when he's looking at a puddle (don't recall exactly) and he's saying ""where have I sen this face? I don't know where the faces come from. This face has lines worn in, but I didn't wear them, who wore this face?""

Here's some things to consider:

1 Capaldi played a guard or some minor role in the fires of Pompeii. Edit: it's been pointed out that his role was not minor. The Doctor personally saves the character and his family. Been a while since I've seen it.

2 Colin Baker was also cast as a background character in the Davison era, or maybe it was Tom Bakers era. I've never seen the episode but I remember reading this fact about Colin.

3 when Romana regenerates in front of Tom Baker in the classic era she is shown to have choice in her appearance. She can pick and choose. 

My point is that Capaldi seems to be hinting that the Doctors many faces belong to random people that he has met throughout his travels. But unlike Romana his regeneration seems to be a subconscious choice, which they've hinted at before with him ""wanting to be young"" or choosing to be old or serious (time crash)

The easiest choice for me at the moment would be the Youth Mobility Scheme (points based visa). But that would only allow me to stay for 2 years, with no visitor extension (90 days) and no extension into any points based visa.
That being said, to apply for a ""join family living permanently"" visa, I would need to meet the requirement of living with my partner for 2 years, and would have to apply on the very last day the Youth Mobility visa expires...and would have to leave the country.

Are there any alternatives to the Youth Mobility scheme or the ""join family living permanently visa"" so I do not have to leave the UK during re-applications? I am very serious about moving to and working in the UK and so any guidance or insight is appreciated.

Plenty of shelves of leatherbound books along the far walls, what looks to be a small mirror alcove if I'm not mistaken. That would be the first time I've seen a mirror in the main room of a TARDIS, in the old days it would have been impossible due to the risk of camera crew flashing.

I've seen a few articles and comments on the subject, most of which seem to be written by people with absolutely zero understanding of how politics, ethnicity and religion work in Northern Ireland.  Either that or Jamie Bryson has been tutoring them in history. 

For example I really don't think there would be any support for Northern Ireland joining up with an independent Scotland.  Now we definitely do have a huge cultural connection with them, far more than we do with the English and nearly as much as the one we share with the rest of Ireland, but why the fuck would we decide to join up with independent Scotland over Ireland?  Hell why would either country even want us?

But to my point.  I understand that Republicans (myself included) will get a jolly from laughing at sad English politicians, and I will definitely find the political chaos that follows a Yes vote very interesting indeed (that shit is like heroin for history nerds), but would Scottish independence really encourage Irish unity?  If anything I can see it strengthening Unionist determination to stay with the remainder of Britain, especially if hardcore Scottish Unionists decide to try and make a living over here.

And then you have the Unionist reaction, do any of them other than the Fleggers really care that much about Scotland that they feel like they deserve a vote?  I've heard quite a few English yokes on the news tonight saying how they should get a say too, and whilst it does make sense they really only want to vote on it so they can vote No.  Some people over here would also like a similar say, but again they want to use it to vote No.  These people don't really care about Scotland, they probably don't care that much about Britain either, they just want it to stay whole for whatever reason they have.

Thoughts everyone?

Also personally I'd like to see the Republic, NI and Independent Scotland joining up with Norway and Iceland and forming a big Celitc-Viking Economic Union where we run the oil and gas and just be really cool with everyone whilst having a ridiculously high standard of living.

But parts of it might be true. That being said here we go.

Now the 'promised land' IMO could be the Matrix which is a Timelord repository system which contains all timelord knowledge. Its like a HUGE virtual library. What if Missy (and she could be anyone in this scenario maybe the Rani, Master, Rassilon anyone really) is collecting all the people that die as a result of The Doctor as evidence inside The Matrix. A huge theme this series has been whether The Doctor is a good man. So what if Missy shows The Doctor all the horrible things he's done and convinces him that he's a terrible person by showing all the people that he's hurt and he sets out to right his wrongs. And he starts doing that by putting his sixth incarnation under trial and takes up the name of the Valeyard. We know the Valeyard is an incarnation between the 12th and the last one so hey Capaldi could be the Valeyard questioning whether he is a good man? Just something thrown out there!

Either that or Missy herself could be the Valeyard collecting evidence to put The Doctor under trial.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,I have a wild theory on Missy and Capaldi's Doctor.

In time and the Rani (old who) she hints at the fact that she and the Doctor had a fling growing up. Missy calls the doctor her boyfriend. the clockwork robot was uploaded. (speculating) although ALTHOUGH we see his body on top of big ben. but wait a minute hes a robot so one of two things could happen. his conscious could be uploaded onto a Tardis Databank as if he is just an A.I. similar to what happens to 2 when the toymaker uploads an A.I. into the tardis causing it to crash thus being able to capture him.(could be wrong on that let me know if i mixed up some old who stories) but that seems a little improbable because then the rani would have to constantly travel in and out of her own body into her own tardis database. So what if she recovered the body, look back, he's wearing different clothing which could hint at the idea that she found took restored and reclothed him. now for the girl. in that very same episode the Doctor conveniently surrounded the tardis around Blue the very second before she was about to die. 12 leaves whats-her-face to die and doesn't turn back. His Tardis makes the wooooosh screech screech noise because he leaves the breaks on so whats to say that the Rani didn't materialize right around the woman directly before she was going to be executed. now the robot man was in a garden and good ole whats-her-face was in a tea hall. how many rooms does a Tardis have? infinite. could she be keeping everyone away from each other until she fills them in on her master plan? yup.

Not surprising, really. They are both outspoken, controversial, and they both implement politics in their humor. It's just that...Bill Hicks was famously anti-corporations.

What better way to have signified it than to give him the #7 from Suarez?

I know that during the transfer window that a lot of people mentioned it and the general reply was that it was maybe being saved for a big signing. Well in my opinion, right now there is no player in the world that could have signed for us that would have walked into the team and deserved it more.

If its because they have already sold a shit load of his kit with #31 on then I say thats bollocks too because I've got a Gerrard #17 2005 kit in my wardrobe that I wore for a whole season of him playing #8 and I didn't complain once.

I was happy that Stevie got the #8 and I'd be just as happy if i'd paid money for a Sterling kit and they changed his last minute.

The lad deserves the #7 and who would I to be selfish enough to think the number on the back of my shirt matters more. (Although I did stop getting names printed on the back after the Gerrard incident, but thats beside the point!)

So yeah, I wonder why they haven't given it to him? Do you think there is a chance that he wants to keep his number? Surely not? Would a player being signed actually be arsed if there wasn't a decent number available for him at the time?

I'm seeking clinical practitioners to take part in a brief research session focussed on the use of a clinical decision support system. The aim of the study is to understand how healthcare professionals make decisions based on the advice of these systems. 
This study is part of an academic research and design MSc project.

Who I am looking for:
General healthcare professionals or students (close to graduating) whose roles involve physical examinations and diagnosing patients (GPs, practice nurses, etc.)
...within travelling distance from London

What you would be asked to do:
The research session will last no longer than 40 minutes and will take place at a location convenient to you.  During the session, you will be asked to review three hypothetical case studies, and then indicate your likely next steps to achieve a diagnosis. That's it!

Compensation:
Participants who complete the study will be given their choice of compensation: baked goods, refreshments, or £8 Amazon gift voucher (sorry... I wish I could offer more!)

The study session can take place any time between 20 September and 10 October.

Interested? Know anyone who might be interested? Questions? Message me!

I am in the midst of searching for a new smartphone, having had my contract finished recently and choosing to go onto a sim rolling contract instead of an upgrade. 

As such, I have been looking at smartphones for the better part of a month now only to be more confuzzled at the click of every new YouTube video review on X phone.

I am looking for an ANDROID smartphone, sim free, looks good, good battery life (I love browsing reddit on commutes and when I'm bored in lectures), crisp display and takes good photos. 

My initial go to phone was the HTC One M8. It looked nice, made of premium metal and seemed decent in respect to the above criteria I had. However, when I went into a Carphone Warehouse to look at it myself I just didn't like it. I felt it the screen was too narrow and quite slippery (this was actually a major point in many of the reviews I watched/read).  

I then looked at the LG G3 - despite it being made of plastic it still had a metal look and had everything I wanted PLUS it had a removable battery! (Which after having an iPhone realised how much of a blessing this was) But again, many reviews spoke about it heating up and the phone actually giving you warnings to limit usage or dim the display to prevent overheating. This does not make me feel comfortable at all. 

I've briefly looked at the Sony Xperia Z2 which actually seems quite brilliant in all fronts (though the design is a bit lacking for me but everything else more than makes up for this). However, there always seems to be a down side - with the Z2 a lot of people have reported poor quality of voice calls (though this might be network related if you're on a particular network) and overheating. 

I've considered posting in r/technology and r/android but I wanted to make it UK specific as they may have different phones out right now in the US. 

Any advice?

Nothing more, nothing less. Please don't take it as much more.

**Ladbrokes**

I was informed that Ladbrokes have correctly predicted every general election result two weeks ahead since 1923. I don't know if this is true so please correct me if not.

At present the odds are favouring a strong No victory. 

http://cl.ly/image/170g03401L3d

Implied probability for No is 71%
Implied probability for Yes is 35%

Probability favours **NO**

Again, if I have made an error in the calculation, please let me know.

**Polls**

YouGov Poll didn't report 51% Yes, so why is it reported as such?

I understand that it might be general practice for journalists to equally dissect the 'Don't Know' votes equally between the two camps, but it is a bit misleading.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/poll-tracker

The two most recent polls:

YouGov http://cl.ly/image/2D0Q183D0g0u - 8% Don't Know
TNS-BMRB http://cl.ly/image/3u3P1V2E3L1E - 23% Don't Know

This is a huge margin of error, and implies that the result could be quite forceful in either direction. 

My gut feeling is that if somebody doesn't know by now, they are less likely to go for radical change. 

*They have toyed with the idea but if they have not bought into the hype by now, they are more likely to stick with what they know. The hype train is sitting the station pumping steam into the air, and blowing its horn, and they haven't got on board.*

Following on from our Ladbrokes No probability sentiment indicator, if for the sake of **generalist wildly unsubstantiated assumptions**, we take the average of Don't Knows (8% &amp; 23%) - which is 15.5%.

If we take the average of the No's between the two recent poles (45% &amp; 39%) we have 42%, and add on the 15.5%, we have 57%.

There we go. 

*Using an ad hoc, two bob analytical approach, I predict that No will win with 57% of the vote.*

1. Why are people of London not scared &amp;amp; panicking (Instead they are watching it like its a freak or some exotic creature they have seen for first time) on seeing a dinosaur, carrying on with their daily lives like its a normal day?

2. Are the police in on the whole thing and how are they working with Doctor and Vastra?

3. Should I keep watching season 8 or should I stop until I've caught up?

4. I've seen the viewing order on some websites and they include torchwood and sarah jane adventures, should I skip those or are they vital to the continuity?

5. I didn't understand the logic of the golden arrow part at the end of 803, is that something that just happens regularly on the show  and you have to accept it as a plot device?

6. Do the people know that the Doctor, Aliens, Robots, Droids, Time Travel and Life on other planets etc. exist?

(I know the basics and premise of the series.)

If the questions seem dumb just answer 3rd and 4th and I'll understand.

Original email:

""Hello there,

I've just read an article on the BBC website (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28656324) that states that armed police are to become a regular occurrence on the streets of Scotland. I understand the need for armed police in certain areas such as airports, but I'm strongly against the presence of firearms in regular areas such as our own Norwich. Although not introduced here, there's a tendency for us to just slowly 'get used' to things like this. 

I would like to know your view on this matter.

Many thanks,

_SHOULD_BE_WORKING_""

---
In response Mr Simpson contacted Mike Penning, the minister of state for policing, criminal justice and victims. His response below:

""Dear Keith,

Thank for you your letter of 11th August on behalf of _SHOULD_BE_WORKING_ of _MY_ADDRESS_ about the use of firearms by the police in England.

The policy in England and Wales has long been that the police should not be routinely armed. This gives a character to our policing that we should not readily give up and is vital in securing the trust of our public.

The police have a wide range of tactical options and tools to resolve conflict. However, officers should also have the best possible protection when facing threats of physical violence and this includes the use of firearms by properly trained officers, when necessary.

The use of firearms by the police is closely governed by the police's own authorised professional practice for England and Wales, which is overseen by the College of Policing. This guidance has been adopted by Police Scotland. The use of firearms by the police is, and will hopefully remain rare. However, whether to authorise the use of firearms and the decision on how armed offices are deployed is an operations matter, and is therefore a decision for Chief Officers in all forces to make.

I hope that clarifies the Government's position on the important issues raised by _SHOULD_BE_WORKING.

Rt Hon Mike Penning MP.""

Despite him having a decent start to the season, I don't think the best Liverpool starting XI still includes Gerrard. 

I know that's blasphemous in some parts, but I'm convinced his defensive shortcomings are no longer outweighed by his offensive contributions. Because we now have two ""front-foot"" defenders in Sakho and Lovren, there are going to be more occasions where they are caught out by quick attacking players and will need cover. I don't think Stevie is the man to provide that, although for that matter I don't think Lucas is either. 

I'd like to see Stevie shifted back into his old CM position alongside Henderson with Allen holding. After 60 minutes or so I would substitute Stevie, probably for Emre Can, and then either shift Allen into CM and have Can hold, or keep Allen holding and have Can switch straight for Stevie. 

Allen is very much a hard-working and tenacious player with good positioning and I think he would be willing to do whatever BR asks of him. I know he won that penalty against Spurs but his contributions in the final third are generally negligible, so I think his abilities to dispossess players, hold and recycle the ball and just generally be a complete nuisance to attackers would be best served at the base of the diamond. 

Thoughts? It's tough to say but Stevie will need to be replaced for the long term soon, likely within the next 2 transfer windows, so I think it merits discussion.

**I will be waiting for and collecting mail until the end of September and into the first week of October**, just to make sure I've got everyone's mail. I will then send a package out to LFC, which will be forwarded directly to Daniel.

I'm hoping this is a huge success -- it would be amazing for Daniel to receive a box with letters bursting out of it, all wishing him the best for his future.

Thanks all, and looking forward to receiving your letters to Agger.

**Penultimately:**  
If you'd like to head up another farewell gift for Agger, please feel free to create your own thread and begin. I will definitely try to participate in whatever way I can.

**Lastly:**  
The link to the thread for Donations (to The Agger Foundation) is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2fsztz/daniel_agger_fan_farewell_donations_thread_2/). I'm asking people to list their donations so I can get an approximate count of who has donated. If you feel uncomfortable disclosing the amount, you do not have to -- you can simply state that you have or have not donated.

Anyone have experience with this? Shall i just try my luck? I hear the DVLA have terrible records and heard rumours that my trips home sort of 'reset' my residency as such. I don't think i've ever entered the UK on my NZ passport, only my Irish one.

Fair admission here, I'm not a Christian. My interest was initially sparked by the notion that Tydecho could be a Christianized Pagan God. Shoving the word 'saint' before a stubborn deity's name wasn't unknown in the early days of the British church.  But human saint or Pagan God, the question is the same.

Points that have me wondering:

1. The spelllings of their names have only become fixed in quite recent centuries.  If you return to Mediaeval sources then Tydecho is referred to as: Decho, Dudec, Tudec, Thudec, Thudoc, Tudes, Techo, Dydecho, Titechon, Techocho, Tydoch, Tydach and a lot more too. Dogmael is variously Dochuael, Dochmael, Dogfael, Ddygfael, Dogwel etc. Tudoc is sometimes Dudoch or Tudoch.

1. Tydecho's main 'hood is the Mawddwy/Mallwyd area. His (once) mother church at Llanmawddwy was originally called Llandudoch.  Llandudoch is also the alternative name for St Dogmael's near Cardigan.

1. Llandudoch (aka St Dogmael's) apparently refers to the fact that he jointly set up his holy order there with St Tudoc.  Nothing else is known about St Tudoc.

1. When St Dogmael set up his church, he was accompanied for a while by St Tydecho!  Who apparently lived there for several years, despite also being in Mawddwy at the same time.

1. According to a Mawddwy legend, Dogmael was Tydecho's brother and lived there for a while with him and their sister Tegfedd. (Another legend says that this was Cadfan; yet another says it was Cadfael; and a third states it was Samson. Some also change Tegfedd's name to Tegfan.)

1. For centuries, St Tydecho went by a nickname variously rendered Tydecho Filwr or Techo Filwr.  Filwr means 'warrior'.  The 'mael' of Dogmael also means prince or warrior, the two things being interchangeable at the time.  Though I am hoping that someone more fluent than I will help fine-tune the translation there.

So are they the same person, do you reckon?  Just known by different names in different regions, or else split into three by the British Church, during the time when they were trying to fend off a Rome takeover by emphasizing that British/Irish Christianity was there first.",false,HistoryWales,t5_33hgc,null,null,self,"Were St Tydecho, St Dogmael and St Tudoc all the same person?",6,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryWales/comments/2g08an/were_st_tydecho_st_dogmael_and_st_tudoc_all_the/

Thinking I'd just failed myself, I was about to silently scream a 'fuuuuuck', until the examiner shouted over ""have another go.""  
Yelled back a ""Thank you!"", and off I went.  
Managed it correctly, exited the area, parked up and went inside.

""Congratulations, you've passed.""

Adebayor is starting and captaining Togo today against Ghana in the AFCON group qualifying. I'd imagine he'll go 90 minutes, so it looks like we'll see either Harry Kane or Roberto Soldado start in his place.

I love the HurriKane, but I think Soldado deserves the start. Kane has also just played 90 minutes for the England U-21s, while Soldado has been in training and is fit.

We got to witness the Lamela-Soldado connection against Limassol, and those two were dangerous the second Lamela came on as a substitute. I know Limassol aren't the best opposition, but Soldado did amazingly well to score that goal. Poor pitch, great ball from Lamela and Bobby takes it perfectly right out of the air while losing his feet from underneath him.

Soldado has only played in the Premiership this season as a late sub against QPR. He hasn't started for us in the Premier League since we were trounced by Liverpool in March. I know a lot of people are labeling Soldado as a flop, but we can't already be giving up on a striker of his talent. There's still a chance he comes good and becomes a quality Premier League striker, the kind we need if we're serious about competing for the Top 4 this season. The man didn't just lose his talent. He'll be playing under better circumstances this year with a manager who knows what he is doing, and our pressing tactics are perfect for Bobby who is always quick on his feet. 

Give him the start at Sunderland. Harry Kane has tremendous potential, but he's never reached the level of play that Soldado showed during his time in Spain. Kane's time will come, but Soldado's time is now.

And with our great shadow Secretary State for Scotland, Margaret Curran, and Lawrence Wason, the Scottish Secretary of USDAW, who has done so much in this campaign.

And it has been a privilege to be part of this campaign, talking to the people of Scotland about the huge choice they face.

I was absolutely clear that today the right thing to do was not to be at PMQs.

But to be back in Scotland listening and making the case.

And in these final days I want to make the case about why I think the right thing to do is to vote for no.

And for Scotland stay in the United Kingdom.

Head, heart and soul.

Head: because I believe we can better create a more equal, a more socially just society together than we can alone.

Heart: because of the ties that bind us together and would be irreversibly broken by separation.

And soul: because it is solidarity that built the great institutions like our National Health Service and can tackle the great injustices of our time.

But I cannot make this case without being candid about my place in it.

I am not a Scot.

I don’t have a vote.

But I do care passionately about the outcome of this referendum.

I care because of the values that motivate me as a person, the reasons I am in politics.

My parents were immigrants, Jews who fled from the Nazis.

They taught me a faith that you should not just get angry about injustice but you should do something about it.

I grew up in the 1980s against the backdrop of the Miners’ strike and Mrs Thatcher.

I saw communities ripped apart by unemployment.

I hated what she was doing to our country and that’s why I joined the Labour Party at 17.

I marched against the poll tax.

And today I feel an immense sense of pride to lead the party I joined then, more than twenty five years ago.

My argument for Scotland to say no starts from the belief in tackling injustice wherever we find it.

The people of Scotland whether they intend to vote no or yes, have established beyond doubt in this campaign that there needs to be profound economic and political change.

I have heard it wherever I have gone in this campaign.

I remember in particular someone I met outside a shopping centre who told me that he was voting no but I needed to realise that too many people he knew could not find decent jobs.

Let me say: this thirst for change is shared across the United Kingdom.

We cannot carry on with an economy that only works for a few people at the top and doesn’t work for most people.

A Labour government will act.

Changing the way our country works and tackling the injustice we see is at the core of the Labour Party’s programme, and the contract we have set out with the people of Scotland.

Getting rid of David Cameron’s government.

An end to the exploitation of zero hours contracts.

A higher minimum wage.

A fairer tax system.

Young people back to work.

The abolition of the bedroom tax across the whole of the UK.

And unlike the SNP we won’t just say it, we vote for it too.

Part of that desire for change is change in how we are governed.

And making it easier for Scotland to deliver on social justice by devolving more powers on fairer tax, on work, on social security, to the Scottish Parliament.

And we will meet the timetable set out by Gordon Brown and Johann Lamont earlier this week and agreed by other Scottish leaders yesterday.

And a Labour government will deliver on it in the first Queen’s speech.

And it beats by a long way the change on offer from the other side of the argument on social justice.

And for a very simple reason:

Because as six Scottish trade unions set out at the weekend, independence would lead to a race to the bottom.

As corporations seek competitive advantage from being in one country or another.

Seeking to drive down tax rates, wage rates and terms and conditions.

And don’t take my word for it.

Because Alex Salmond himself is proposing a 3p cut in corporation tax, taking money away from working families.

Why, when he says public services are facing such pressure, when college places have been cut, when so many people are facing so much hardship would someone claiming to be a social democrat make this his only redistributive proposal?

Because it is where independence takes you: away from social justice.

Not towards it, a race to the bottom.

This is the start of the case that I want to make to you.

But for me the case for saying no goes far beyond these arguments of the head.

To arguments of the heart.

My Dad was in the Royal Navy, stationed in Inverkeithing during the Second World War, serving alongside Scots.

And so many, across the United Kingdom, will have their own connections of friendship and family with Scotland.

Feelings of the heart.

And we are seeing the expressions of those feelings in the saltires being flown elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

A simple message to the people of Scotland:

Please stay with us.

Stay with us because we are stronger together.

Stay with us so we can change Britain together.

And I want to visit Inverkeithing with my children when they are old enough to tell them about the grandfather they never knew and his service in the war.

And I want them to be visiting part of our United Kingdom, not part of another country.

And these connections of the heart work in both directions.

Like the great-grandmother I met here whose great-grandchildren now live in England.

She didn’t want them living in a different country.

It has been said that the emotional argument lies with independence.

Not for me.

Not for so many people across our country.

Because our hearts lie with you.

And for me the third set of arguments are perhaps the most powerful.

The arguments of the soul.

Our movement was founded on solidarity.

That is what it is to be Labour.

My parents were internationalists.

But because of ties of history, geography, connection we are not just citizens of the world, but citizens of the United Kingdom.

And we have an extraordinary history which speaks to this strength and solidarity across our whole country.

And that’s why we have achieved so much.

We demanded and won workers’ rights across the UK, with Scottish trade unions leading the way.

We overcame Fascism and fought for freedom in the world.

We built a National Health Service, Scots, and English and Welsh working together.

And, we secured a National Minimum Wage, the great legacy of John Smith.

And solidarity is not just a historical artefact.

It is there to be built upon today.

The family in Edinburgh cares about the poor child in London.

The working people of Liverpool care about the working people of Glasgow.

Which is why Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, was the first to fly the saltire yesterday morning.

The young people of Manchester care about pensioners in Paisley.

And these bonds of solidarity can lead us to new achievements.

Taking on the vested interests from the energy companies to the banks together.

Putting our young people back to work together.

Replacing insecurity at work with security together.

Building fairness and justice together.

I said at the start, we all have our own values that we bring to this debate.

Scotland’s values of fairness, justice and equality have shone through in this referendum campaign.

But to meet those values I know we have to change our country.

Together we can do that.

Not by irreversibly breaking apart.

With all the risks that means.

But by building a different future.

Solidarity.

Social Justice.

Together, not alone.

From the head.

From the heart.

From the soul.

Vote No in this referendum.

Typical. Although it's a good dilemma to have, I suppose. 

Obviously I have to choose one, and fairly soon too. 

Job A pays more, but is the other side of the country so I'll have to leave my friends and parents far behind. However, I have family on my mum's side in that part of the country, so I can stay with them whilst I sort things out. It's also for a Local Authority, so I imagine it will be a bit more secure and structured than Job B. It's based in Cambridge, ideal for me in that it will be somewhere with a bit of life, whilst not being a huge city. The cost of living is notoriously high though.

Job B in in exports, pays quite a bit less (minimum wage, in fact, although they conduct payment reviews in the New Year apparently) but is practically on my doorstep, and so would allow me to remain in contact with my mates, whilst still being able to move out at some point, and afford a room in a house share in a nearby town where there are actually people, amenities and entertainment. It would also allow me to gain some useful experience, which I could possibly use in the future in a better paid job. Of course, that's far from certain.

I had contemplated speaking to job B tomorrow, telling them I've been offered a better salary at job A, and seeing what they have to say re. money. 

So yeah, sorry for the wall of text there. I'm not asking anyone to make the choice for me, but it would interesting to get some input.

**TL;DR:** Been offered 2 jobs, one near to home but less money, one the other side of the country, better money. What do?

I feel that the increasing use of the word foreign as a negative word is a bit disconcerting. Since when was anything foreign a bad thing?

In no ill way do I say this, but there are times when I feel England and the rest of the UK are foreign to me, in that a lot of things I take for granted as 'very British' turn out to be only Scottish. I am not a patriot by any means, but I feel self conscious about my 'Scottishness' in London as much as I do abroad. And nor is that a bad thing! But when people look at me wide eyed when I tell them I came down ""all the way from Edinburgh"", as if it's some far off place... You feel a disconnect.

This man would introduce me to the Dallas Spurs Supporters group. 
I immediately paid my dues to join. This season I attended my first watch party with the group and Eric Dier's first goal was the first time I have ever celebrated with a group. I'll never forget it. At that point I had never been so happy to support Spurs. I know that goal may not go down in Spurs history but it was more than just a goal to me.

Short story: Was at vacation at 15, met this girl. Sarah. Had a blast for a few weeks, pretty much the single best memory with a girl I got I assume. Pretty hollywood-ish. Regardless, the last day of her vacation we agreed to meet a place, give the information to continue our friendship, and our parents had agreed to. Due to unforutnate circumstances, we were unable to attend. According to the hosts at the place we were supposed to meet, she had stayed until they closed, crying, with me never showing up, before leaving early the next day. And just like that, she was gone.

It's very early on in the season following a highly productive transfer window for our club, where a mix of experienced premier league footballers and young internationals with bags of talent have been brought in. The players along with the fans have high expectations, and we all hope that this current crop of young men are the ones to carry our club to greatness. However the sad reality is that out of all our new signings there will inevitably be some who don't live up to expectations at one of the biggest football clubs in the world. It's time to ask this community who they think will be seen as failures and ushered out of the door in the forthcoming transfer windows. Please include the justification for your nominations, and remember that this post may be worth a few giggles at the end of the season.

It started when Avanta (a work programme) attempted to stop my brothers JSA when he refused, under instruction from his adviser, to borrow money so he could travel to Leeds to work. We later found that it was a job he could not legally have been forced to do. Even if that was not the case, morally it was a low thing to do. He was lied to and treated very unfairly. 
As a result he became stressed and even frightened to attend the work programme at Avanta. Eventually he went back to the jobcentre, explained his situation and was told it would be sorted. In this case, 'sorted' meant sanctioned. 
Now I have only just recently got back into work myself and I am sick of seeing how people are treated, worse still when it is my own kin. I was also with Avanta and found them about as helpful as a hernia. They didnt get me a single interview, instead it was a someone who worked under Avanta that helped me get into work.
Now it seems he is to be forced into unpaid labour, yes I know that JSA counts as payment, but keep in mind he was sanctioned.

I obviously cant give too many details, but any advice anyone could give on how to recieve some fair treatment for once would be greatly appreciated.

As a young person with a rather severe disability, I grew up under the knowledge that life was a fragile thing, and it terrified me. It was a truth that no young boy should be forced to encounter. I saw friends who shared my disability struggle with the many medical issues that it entails. Some did not survive that struggle. As I grew up the fear remained, a kind of constant anxiety that seemed to follow me from one stage of life to another. It is a terrible thing to feel as though your future is written, your accomplishments muted. Even into my college years, the fear seemed to strangle me. But then something happened. A silly little TV show saved me.

The Doctor is one of the greatest fictional characters ever written, and as all great fiction does....it left its audience changed. I decided to believe in the absurd, to believe that in my final moments I'll hear the whir of a Tardis and see an outstretched hand pulling me to something new. A childish fantasy perhaps, but one that has enabled me to do things I would never have imagined. And until that moment, I have promised myself to live up the ideals that make The Doctor great.

I will value people. I will value the acts of bravery present all around me every day, the kindness and love that drives people to do the incredible. I will take joy in wit, in learning, in meeting those different from myself, and strive to meet them from a place of empathy. I won't let a difficult past harm my ability to live life fully, or change for the better. 

When faced with the darker moments of my disease, I will be brave and mine from suffering something unique and valuable. And should I live another year or eight hundred, I will cherish all the people I have been and am yet to be, every companion, every person that has made this life extraordinary. In the end, I don't have time to be afraid. I'm on an adventure...

But to do that I’m going to say what I think series 1-4 did well, and why RTD was the better writer. Biggest point, character development and depth. Moffat doesn’t provide it and RTD did, and it makes such a huge difference. Getting to know a character and staying consistent with a characters behavior is so so so important when writing anything, particularly a TV show. All of RTD’s companions, and even some side characters, had depth. We knew all of the companions families, we knew their jobs, we knew about their past. We had Mickey, and Jackie for Rose, who where well developed themselves. Martha had her whole family and her friends. And with Donna RTD gave us Wilfred and Donna’s mother. 

All of these side characters played substantial roles throughout the series and all of their actions made sense and added to the plot. They helped develop the companion’s personalities and took the show back down to Earth, which is needed for viewers to relate to. When a companion has no family and no explainable past, it can be interesting and mysterious but if that character only interacts with two other people consistently, we don’t get to see their whole personality. We only get to see how they behave around The Doctor, and all of their actions are based purely off The Doctors influence, because that’s the only influence we have seen effect them. 

RTD wrote in side characters not just for fun, as Moffat seems to like doing, but to add to the plot and to help develop the companions and even The Doctor. Rose, Martha, and Donna are all very well developed characters that I know so well I could write a narrative and have it stay consistent with their personalities. RTD wrote in defining characteristics for each of them, and they each have their own style and specific character qualities that set them apart from the average human being. Where as if I where to try and write Amy or Clara in a story removed from the Doctor Who universe where The Doctor isn’t present, I don’t know how they would behave. I honestly could not write dialog for them, because I don’t know how they would behave in a situation that isn’t directly related to The Doctor. Why does it matter that I’m able to remove these characters from the Doctor Who universe you might ask? 

Because the companion shouldn’t be written as a supporting role, the stars of the show are the Doctor *and* the Companion. The companion is supposed to *add* to the dynamic and give us another personality to follow. Clara and Amy without influence from The Doctor are bland characters, and would not be interesting without the Doctor present. I would gladly watch a show following Rose Tyler’s life, because she was interesting. Donna was interesting, and hell even Martha was interesting. They all had well developed lives away from the Doctor and that’s what made them more engaging and that’s what gave them the required depth to be well developed independent characters. Without the Doctor, Amy and Clara are not interesting, because the Doctor *is* what makes them interesting.

The story arcs are the second major issue I have with Moffat’s writing, it annoys me so much that I almost don’t even want to take the time to write out and explain how bad Moffat is with balancing over arching story arcs with individual episodes. You all should be able to tell by now that he isn’t good at it. And if you have seen series 1-4 you definitely should have noticed how rubbish Moffat’s story arcs are compared to RTD’s. For those of you who may not see it, ill explain. 

Lets just start with a reminder of what RTD story arcs were. Series one had us following Rose, and the mystery of “Bad Wolf” and what it meant. This was very pointedly put into nearly every episode, and revealed to us on Satellite 5. It was compelling, but didn’t take away from each individual episode, and the end of the series conclusively resolved it. In series two we have Torchwood, this is an excellent story arc because we get a few episodes based on Torchwood, and it is very present and very much part of the plot for several episodes scattered throughout the series. This is also conclusively resolved and we get satisfying end results with the arc, and the arc added to story lines. The third series we have The Master and the “drumming”. The drumming is a reoccurring event, and has substantial meaning. Again this is something small enough and not to agonizingly mysterious that it can be hinted at and brought up during other episodes, but it isn’t taking away from the story line in those episodes. We get a very good resolution for this story arc with an all out fight between the Master and The Doctor. These story arcs are compelling, but not so much so that they distract from each individual episode. It’s a good balance. 

Now we can take those three and compare it to the more recent three written by Moffat, these arcs include things like… What are these cracks in the universe, who the fuck is River Song, and who is Clara and where did she come from? Also why does Rory keep dying? And to be honest the only solidly answered question out of these is that we know River Song is Amy’s daughter. 

These story arcs are too compelling to be overarching, and could easily be written and resolved in one 45 min episode. They are very compelling, interesting story ideas that would help develop the characters. But instead of answering these very interesting questions, Moffat writes a load of unrelated episodes and keeps us nearly completely in the dark. I still don’t know where those cracks came from, and rebooting the universe, I don’t care how silly Doctor Who is, rebooting the universe is a stupid stupid stupid resolution to the story arc. It was almost as if Moffat came up with the idea of the cracks in the universe without actually knowing how he was going to resolve the mystery. And before he knew it the series finale was the next episode and he was sitting in his room and realized, well shit I haven’t thought about this at all. And so he just said, “fuck it” and made up a bullshit episode that fixes everything. He built up the mystery and developed it but didn’t follow through with a good explanation.
 
I’ve now written too much, but you can take what I’ve said and apply to the others series. RTD understood what Doctor Who was about, he was good at creating new monsters, he was good at character development, he crafted beautiful relationships between the Doctor and his companions, the story arcs never took away from the other episodes, and the episodes never failed to add to the story arc, he wrote the perfect balance of witty comedy, dark angst, and emotion, and he never left questions unanswered. Moffat isn’t a smart writer, he doesn’t do well with big story arcs, and his character development is rubbish. Now this is all opinion, very biased opinion at that, but I was wondering if anyone else agreed.  Also feel free to give your opinions either agreeing with me, or defending the Moff. I’m always open to new interpretations.


TL;DR Doesn’t like Steven Moffat’s writing, and hasn’t enjoyed Doctor Who at the same level since RTD left the show at the end of Series 4.

So this is it post-break, it started leaking when I was moving last Monday. It does hold a certain sentimental value to me and I'm reluctant to throw it away.

It's a sort of egg timer which uses coloured drops of ""water"" which stay in little balls within clear water. The coloured drops are heavier than the ambient water which means when you flip it over the coloured drops fall to the other side, making the wheels turn. One of the sides finished before the other. In the middle, it's a pink/red gel which takes longer than the droplets to finish.

Thing is, searching for things like water timer, water wheel, etc. don't give me anything useful.

She's a 19 year old beauty who takes no shit from the two dogs where I am staying. She's really tiny. There is also 14 year old Mia who is delightfully chubby who fell in love with me immediately. She kept popping her head over the fence to make sure I am okay and to chat to me this morning. Apparently she used to be so chubby that you could not see her paws; next door fed her all the meat. She has lost a lot of weight now but could still do with some aerobics to tighten up that loose belly skin.

Then there is Cooper, a 14 month old dog of some kind. No idea what, small and yappy. He's an attention seeking little bastard. If I stroke a pusscat he is there immediately trying to steal my attention. He and I are going to have a falling out if he crawls under me and puts his wet doggy nose on my inner thigh when I stroke the kitties again.

Then there's the female dog, the name of which currently escapes me. She's quite a bit older and a bit batty. She takes one dog treat, hides it down the sofa cushion and then fiercely guards it all day. She doesn't like young Cooper. He wants to play all the time but she gives no shits, and god help him if he attempts to get anywhere near her hidden treasure. Female dog dislikes the lampshade in the lounge and is often found sitting and barking at it.

There are cats next door both ways. The neighbour to the right seem to feed all the neighbourhood cats. They have apparently built a large structure for them all to sleep in. It's alright for me to knock and ask to see it, right?

Then there are two Lynx cats who live nearby. Beautiful I am told, and worth about 2k each. They like to sit on the shed and taunt the dogs. However, they also beat up Mia. Not on my bloody watch they won't!

Moar pics to follow later. I have had 0 minutes sleep, but as you can probably Imagine, I am in GWNU heaven, floating on cloud nine, and planning a chubby catnapping.

I may never leave this house. 

Oh, the female dog is called Daisy.

On her original contract which covered her first 6 months it stated that she needed to give 2 months notice but she only wants to give one. The original contract stated this but has of course expired. A new contract was never issued and there is nothing with my daughters signature on it to say she is bound now to any 2 month notice period. I said that if he is getting funny about it, ask him to produce such a document with your signature on it. So far he hasn't but threats of holding deposits etc are now coming.

Where does she stand?

What would it take for you to agree that Scotland is better off independent?

The vast majority of Scotland, for a long time, wanting their country to be run differently is my main reason for independence.

There are lots of factors here but what swayed me in favour of independence is the fact Scotland has mostly been governed by a party it hasn't voted for since 50 years ago (only people now over 71 years old would have voted in that election) and for the [past 22 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservative_Party), they have never elected more than 1 MP for that party. In the [2011 Scottish Parliament election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011) 85% of Scottish people voted for a left wing party, yet once again their tax rates are being set by a right wing party that only 15% of them actually want. 

That's my point of view, I'm not wanting to defend it against, ""Coventry hasn't voted Conservative in a while, should we be a separate country too?"" (I've done enough of that on Reddit already).

[Around the same number voted SNP in 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011#Result). Again, about the same number voted Ukip in 2010. This suggests that in 2010 there were as many British and Irish people people voting to leave the UK as there were voting to leave the EU. (You could argue that anti-EU sentiment extends beyond just Ukip voters but this could also be said for Scottish, Welsh, Cornish and Irish views of the UK and their respective independence/nationalist parties). 

Additionally, [The SNP have come first two times in both European elections in Scotland and the Scottish parliament elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party#Electoral_performance), and [Sinn Féin came first in Northern Ireland in the 2009 European elections and second in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in#European_Elections). It looks as though [somewhere in the region of 1.5-2 million Scots are going to vote for independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014), too, whatever the final outcome (I'm assuming a high turnout here).

Overall, it'd be fair to estimate somewhere upward of 2,000,000 citizens of the country don't want to be part of this country anymore. While [this is only about half the number of Ukip voters in the European elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014), it represents a far more significant proportion of people living in those areas with a history of independence and nationalist movements (almost 20%). It's also a far greater than the EU-wide tendency toward anti-EU parties in 2014, which, like the Ukip results, was widely reported as a 'surge'.

(You might argue that I'm kind of cherrypicking here by using the low-turnout EU elections as an indication of Ukip's overall popularity, but low turnout or no the 2014 EU elections represent the highest *absolute* number of Ukip voters in any election, so I think it's fair to count it as a high watermark thus far. If I used General Elections the proportion of Ukip voters would be much lower. Also, calculating support for various kinds of independence is difficult - I read somewhere but now cannot find it that 18% of *SNP voters* are planning to vote *against* independence, while 25-33% of Labour voters are planning to vote *for*. There's also a significant 'Fuck You' factor when it comes to voting for independence and nationalist parties which makes it hard to guage this stuff).

So, taking this all into account, estimates and guesses included, I have a few questions/discussion points:

* Does any other country have a similarly high proportion of people who want to leave it? Perhaps Spain or Belgium?
* If not, what makes Britain so different?
* What does this suggest about the country as a whole? Is it a contemporary crisis or just an inevitable part of our politics given our history?",false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,null,null,self,Discussion: Thoughts about independence/nationalism in the UK.,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BritishPolitics/comments/2g3afi/discussion_thoughts_about_independencenationalism/

If it works properly I wouldn't mind paying a subscription fee/one-off fee. Since Mint doesn't work in UK, I had a brief look at what's available. Here's what I've found:

Moneycenter by Yoodle

Ontrees

First Direct internet banking Plus (First Direct account required)

Money Dashboard

Money Dashboard seems quite alright so I had a brief look at their T&amp;C. Although I don't speak legalese, their T&amp;C seem quite harsh. From what I understand they are basically saying 'we are not liable if we screw up'. Not exactly the kind of company I feel confident sharing my financial information with.

Anyone has any experience with similar services/software? Can you advise me on which one should I try? (I'm aware of YNAB, it's not what I'm looking for.)

EDIT: Thanks for replies everyone, it seems to be the general consensus that such services are in the gray area right now. You are absolutely right that the way almost all of them work means that the user shares sensitive login information with a third party. I did some digging and it seems that Yodlee, provider of Moneycentre, provides back-end solutions for all the software discussed here apart from First Direct Internet Banking Plus. So if you go for Moneydashboard, Ontrees or Pocketsmith, you are not only sharing your data with them, but with Yodlee as well. Yodlee seems to be audited by some US regulators [link](http://help.pocketsmith.com/knowledgebase/articles/302473), but to be honest, it does seem a bit fishy. As for me, I guess I will try First Direct IBP, I was considering opening an account with them anyway. As opposed to the others First Direct IBP does not store your information, and it is a bank that provides the service. From their site:

&gt;for your security, all your usernames and passwords are encrypted and stored in a digital safe on your own computer. 

I guess I'll have to settle for a safer solution at the cost of limited functionality.

I really want to have another job like this, where I can be around books and people who'd like to buy them. I also enjoy the other tasks, like organising shelves and displays.

I'm English. A few years ago I was studying at The University of Leeds, and on my second year of my degree I decided that I didn't want to study any more. I was on a year abroad, and was having a horrible time, with barely any money. On top of that I'd had doubts about what I'd want to do with my degree after I graduate. This culminated in me dropping out of University.

The past couple of years I've been living in another country, just working and staying with some friends that I've known for years. Working a bit, but not really saving anything, just getting by. This isn't important however.

What I really want to ask is any advice on how to get back into studying in the UK again. I never wanted to give up on my education, but because I dropped out in my second year, student finance has said that I have only 2 years of funding left (that's what they said at the time), and that I'd have to pay the first year myself of a 3 year degree. Because of that, and the new very high tuition fee costs, It looks like I cannot study a regular 3 year degree course without saving up something huge like £15,000 first. (that'll take forever with my state of working unskilled).

Am I missing something? Is there another way to get funding for a regular 3 year degree? I have looked into the possibility of a 2 year degree course, but I personally found the courses were of a slim variety that I wasn't interested in.

I have no idea where to start, are there ways of getting private student loans, just for one year that aren't going to have stupidly high interest rates? 

I'm not sure, I'd appreciate any advice related to this.

I want to study a bachelor to narrow that down a bit.

I have pretty decent grades from A levels, ABB but I don't think that's enough for a scholarship.

Anyways, I'm in a muddle, thank you in advance for any advice.

we are five students from Sweden that are working on a project called 'Mission Great Britain' and we are in need of a contact person who is living in Oxford at the moment. 
Our goal with the project is to find out why Oxford is so internationally recognized as it is and we are hopefully going to interview a few students at the university. The contact person is just a small part of the project but it is a necessity for us to be able to travel since finding a contact person is a part of our original assignment. 

We are travelling by plane the 29th of September and we are going back to Sweden the 1st of October. What we need you to do is to be contactable at daytimes during the period (we won't actually need to call you, it's just for the paperwork) and perhaps e-mail a few times before we are leaving. 

If you need any more information or if you are willing to be our contact person, please do not hesitate to PM.

This is a 2-part study. After filling in a few questions about yourself online (about 10 minutes) you would need to attend one short session (approximately 30 minutes) at the University’s Edgbaston campus. You will be asked to complete a few questions about your hunger levels and your mood, and then read a newspaper article, and answer some questions about it. 


All information you provide will remain strictly confidential. You will be provided with refreshments during your time at the laboratory. For safety reasons, individuals with food allergies should not participate. All participants will receive £5 in compensation for their time and be entered into a prize draw to win a £20 gift voucher.


If you would like to take part please visit the study website (http://ow.ly/ArdBo), where you can find more information and register to take part. 


If you have any questions about the study, you can also contact the lead investigator, at: InfoProcStudy@gmail.com

The key to it all is *Robot of Sherwood*. This is the first episode of the season to not have Missy in it. Coincidence? I think not. It's a subtle clue to look closer.

Let's start with the villain of the episode, the Sheriff. Now, he [looks a bit familiar](http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/6/6/8/5/5/9/i/2/0/4/o/Sheriff_of_Nottingham_(Ben_Miller\).jpg), doesn't he? Your first instinct might be that he resembles an [old friend](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121114011015/tardis/images/a/a8/DelgadoLooksLeftCOA.jpg) of ours, but this is a red herring. Moffat's too clever for that, we need to delve deeper. Who else does he look almost just like? That's right, [the six-fingered man](http://www.onlygoodmovies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/count-rugen.jpg) from *The Princess Bride*! Now this is where the level of planning gets impressive. Mel Brooks did his handprint for Grauman's Chinese theater yesterday [*wearing a fake sixth finger*]( http://imgur.com/g3UeNeL.jpg) (also, it happened about as close as you can get between two Saturdays, a clever orchestration). One of, if not the, most acclaimed films of his career is *Young Frankenstein*, where Gene Wilder plays *Doctor* Frederick Frankenstein.  The last thing Gene Wilder acted in was a guest appearance in two episodes of *Will &amp; Grace*, a show famous in the Doctor Who community for almost casting John Barrowman in one of the eponymous roles. Missy is clearly Captain Jack. The connections are there. A certain affinity for the Doctor, plus they both share a lot of features. They both have eyes, a nose, mouth, arms, legs, hair, I could keep going, but I think I've made my point. They're practically the same person. 

You wait and see, over the next few weeks more clues will built up that contribute to this, so don't be surprised when the big reveal comes around in the finale.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,I know who Missy is!,828,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2g3snw/i_know_who_missy_is/

we are five students from Sweden that are working on a project called 'Mission Great Britain' and we are in need of a contact person who is living in Oxford at the moment. 
Our goal with the project is to find out why Oxford is so internationally recognized as it is and we are hopefully going to interview a few students at the university. The contact person is just a small part of the project but it is a necessity for us to be able to travel since finding a contact person is a part of our original assignment. 

We are travelling by plane the 29th of September and we are going back to Sweden the 1st of October. What we need you to do is to be contactable at daytimes during the period (we won't actually need to call you, it's just for the paperwork) and perhaps e-mail a few times before we are leaving.

All quotes are from Bobby himself: 

* ""Every player has come back from international games in a good frame of mind. They had good individual experiences.""

* No injuries were picked up by players on international duty 

* Ross Barkley is ahead of where he should be in terms of recovery but still half way through treatment

* Steven Pienaar and Samuel Eto'o will be assessed ahead of the West Brom game after picking up knocks

* ""I thought we adapted well to each challenge in each of our first three games, but we have been slack in our defensive duties.""

* ""That is something we need to correct. Our attacking play has been pleasing""

* ""Alan Irvine is a football gentleman. We think a lot of him and wish him well but this is a really important game for us."" 

* ""WBA are a team with a lot of new signings - you can't judge them after three games. It will take time to see them settle.""

* ""As you would expect from an Alan Irvine team they want to control the game and keep the ball. His preparation is meticulous.""

* ""Our defending has been a surprise. We've not lost any personnel. We had 15 clean sheets last season""

* ""I was never tempted to go into the market. We have centre halves that I couldn't be happier with. We just need that confidence back.""

* ""We are well aware of what we have to improve on. We just need to get the players enjoying their football.""

* Arouna Kone played 55 minutes in a behind closed doors friendly but hasn't given a date on the Ivorian's return 

* Leon Osman picked up a knock in that game and will be assessed today ahead of West Brom

Yesterday in particular there was a lot of scary stuff to show what the future holds if we vote yes. With all the discussions and arguments going on, people are looking for answers, asking questions. Some people are confused, some are upset and some are even angry at us.

I want to write this letter to my fellow members of this subreddit and explain why I am intending to vote yes a week today and why I want to see Scotland separate from our union.

The first thing I want to address is that you are getting the wrong view from the media. In the last few days since the big 3 traveled up here to convince us of staying in the union the British media has been ablaze in reports and stories, however most of them are missing out on some of the most exciting things about this referendum.

What most of these big organizations are failing to report to you is the political engagement that is taking pace up here. Every single night all over the country, families of all shapes and sizes are packing town halls, community centers, pubs, clubs the lot. They aren't politicians, they aren't campaigners, they are regular folk like you or me and they are in the thick of it. Night after night people debate and discuss our upcoming decision, they excitement of going it solo, the advantages of staying in the union. People are politically involved like you have never seen before, they are switched on and they are thinking. You can see it in their faces, this country is different, it's changed - People are switched on in a way I have never seen before and I truly believe it will never be the same again. They believe in democracy, in politics - they believe for the first time in their lives they can vote for change. I don't mean only the yes voters here, I mean everyone - people truly believe they can make a difference and it's an absolute joy to behold. 

The big media outlets aren't telling you about that, they aren't telling you about the real grassroots of the yes campaign and I believe as such, it paints the wrong picture of this referendum. It paints the picture to the rest of you that it's being spearheaded by Alex Salmond and that folk are just buying into his promises and guarantees's. They aren't telling you about the discussions you hear on the bus, on the train or at work. Up here, the debate really is not as sour or heated as the media paint it, we are civil, we are friendly and we are trying to figure out what's best. It really isn't as polarizing as you might be led to believe.

For my entire life, I have felt disenfranchised to Westminster (I am not silly, I know you do too). I have never felt connected to who our leader was, I have never felt like the politics down in London even cared about me or my wee world up here. Westminster did what's best for London and the UK and that was that, that's the way things have been and will always be. Then along comes this referendum, this guy Alex Salmond, this idea which sounded ridiculous to me at first - ""Why the hell would I want to leave the UK?"" I used to think to myself. However like everyone else, I tuned in, I listened to why it might be good, why it might be bad and for the first time in my life, I took an interest in politics. I learned about how much our Scottish parliament has achieved in it's existence, I got bit by the bug and it's only grew stronger. I feel like for the first time in my life, I could live in a country where what I say or think does matter, it does have meaning. Something I never once thought possible now seems in my grasp. I listened to my Gran, to my mum, talk about what it would mean to be independent, what we, this wee country, could set out to do all on our own and it excites me, it makes me believe.

I'm not voting yes because I hate the union, or because I feel oppressed by the English, that stuff is nonsense. You are all my brothers and sisters. You are mums and dads and uncles and cousins and you want the same thing I want, a roof over your head, food on the table and a happy family. I'm not voting yes because I dislike you, because I want away from you - I love you, I love the UK and no matter what happens **we're not going anywhere**, we will still be those crazy skirt wearing mad bastards that swear a little too much and drink a little too much and no matter how hard we try can never demolish England at football. 

I still want us to work together, I still want to share our assets with each other and if you need help we'll be there, likewise I hope you'll help us. I just want to make a difference, I want that elusive democracy that indeed all of us in the UK feel is a myth. I want us to be successful, to keep our free healthcare, to keep our free education - and I want those things for you as well. 

They aren't really any answers in this rambling, I don't know what's going to happen if we do vote yes, I don't know if we will be another Norway or bring about an economic apocalypse. I just know that when I and my family and my community vote yes, we are doing it with the best of intentions. I really truly hope we vote yes in a weeks time, and I really truly hope you'll see it as cause for celebration along side me.

However, it seems the Yes campaign was terrible, and the No campaign threw enough pictures of dying babies that people voted No.

However, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't want AV. As a voter, we *already* try to self-AV by voting tactically. If you live somewhere which is 40% Con/ 40% Lab and 20% Other, then any sensible voter will vote for Lab/Con as is their preference, as any other vote would be ""wasted"".

Under AV you don't have to do this, you can just vote for your preferred party, then vote your alternative preference for one of the major 2 you were thinking of voting tactically for. But the upside is that if actually 50% of people wanted a certain 3rd party, but were too afraid of the party they didn't like getting in to ""waste"" a vote for them, then they actually get in under AV, while under FPTP they wouldn't.

Another benefit is we would have no BNP MPs unless over 50% of the electorate ranked them higher than the other parties on the ballet. At the moment whenever an area has a high BNP polling, about 4 different people stand under self-made parties as ""Anti-BNP coalition"", ""Unity against racism"" etc, and end up splitting the anti-BNP vote. Possibly this could allow a BNP candidate to get elected with only 20% of the vote, if the 3 major parties poll 19% each, and the various anti-BNP people poll the remaining ~20%.

In my local council ward, we frequently get elections where the results a complete joke. You get the Conservatives on 23%, Labour on 25%, Libdem on 23%, Green on 26%, a few % to others. The result is pretty much random, while under AV you'd get someone who actually secured the majority of the voters confidence.

Ideally, they'd like to consolidate all of this debt, £322K.

We are no longer resident in the UK and no other family member has a UK credit profile which also makes it difficult to know all of the UK financial products or advisers that can truly help. Hence, this ask of PF.

Inheritance Tax liability in the future is a consideration for us. We'd also like to assign some of the property ownership to the children right now to account for other unpaid loans between the children -- yes, it's one of those family messes.

The in-laws can easily survive on their pensions and income from four bedrooms that they rent. We simply need a vehicle to consolidate the debt effectively.

Is a lifetime mortgage (equity release) the best way? How do we manage the Inheritance Tax liability and attributing ownership today? An onshore or offshore Trust? We're also thinking of then putting monthly payments into the mortgage rather than a separate investment/endowment.

Google says that Aviva has one of the best rates but the loan-to-value isn't very high. Who else is reputable?

I've educated myself on the history, wake up at 7 AM local time to watch the games and thoroughly enjoy the league. Am I a front runner because I am a Manchester City fan?

I am 22 years old and I was born in England and have lived here ever since. My father is British and my mother is from Iraq. She has been here in England for over 35 years and she is (obviously) a British Citizen.
She has family members in Iraq still and with the danger increasing day by day we want to move at least 2 of my cousins here. They are both female and one is 36 years old and the other is 30. They do not have children and they are not married. They are both teachers and both live with their parents and support them.
They have a brother who controls their life and restricts them from communicating with many people, and he also beats them for no reason. Basically he is an a**ehole. My mum is contact with them daily and their life is just getting worse and worse, and ISIS is not even in their town yet.
Basically what I am asking is how do we begin the process of helping these poor women out and bringing them to stay with my parents. In their house. They don't need their own house or anything we just want them safe. Who should we contact? Please help. I understand you will almost definitely want more information but we have her in hysterics on the phone right now because she wants to travel somewhere and her abusive brother wont let her.
I apologise if I am in the wrong subreddit but we are sort of in a state of urgency because god knows what their brother will do to them. They do everything for their family but he is unstable and it is only a matter of time before the situation where they live gets worse.

I currently owe £6200 in the form of a bank loan, I have around £7000 debt of credit cards and overdrawn £1200 in the bank.

I've just rang up the bank and tried to extend the bank loan to ~£8000 to cover overdraft so i can get back in the black and have a little left over for for other expenses. At the minute my wages just get eaten almost straight away from outgoings!

Unfortunately the only way to extend the loan would be to take out a whole new loan for ~£8000 over a 5 year period (Note: I currently have 3 years 10 months left of the original loan, and this will increase the price from £160 P/M to £180 P/M but will mean re-instating a new loan for 5 years.)

What is the best way to go about this?

P.S Sorry if its a bit long winded :)

For years I have wanted to learn how to do my own maintenance, take cars apart and be able to piss around with vehicles, but for various reasons I have simply needed a reliable vehicle to get me from A to B and so couldn't do.

However, my wife has recently passed her test, so I now have a legitimate excuse to go out and buy a hobby car that can double as my own toy.

Essentially, I'm looking for a recommendation on an older coupe that I can play with, with view to doing it up and it being a nice car.

I'm hoping to spend less than £5k in cash throughout the life of the project, so the initial purchase cost must be low. I'd be willing to do anything and everything that I can alone, and have tentatively spoken to my local mechanic about him lending me any tools I might need for specialist jobs.

I have practically zero experience under the bonnet of a car, so I guess that whatever I choose shouldn't be overly complicated. I may be going into this a bit naively, but really wanting to be able to buy a haines manual or something and just get stuck in. If I break it, then I'll just swallow my pride and take it to the mechanic :)

Any suggestions?",false,CarTalkUK,t5_2w2lq,null,null,self,Coupe to do up/learn on,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/comments/2g4vyb/coupe_to_do_uplearn_on/

Hi guys!

MEGA ROLLOVER WEEK! 3 weeks of Gold in the pot. The tiebreak will stay the same until the pot is won (not out of laziness... okay maybe out of laziness). I'm also increasing the amount of entrants to 70 in the hope that it gives more people the opportunity to nail it! Good luck guessing!


Please leave a comment below stating your prediction for the upcoming game. I need from you:

&gt;**(1) The Full time score (CLEARLY stating the winner; irrelevant if you think it'll be a draw)** 

&gt;**(2) The First goalscorer (irrelevant if you think it's a 0-0er)**

And the answer to this weeks tiebreak:

&gt;**(3) The minute in which the first goal is scored.**

______________________________________________________
**Gold Pot:** 3 Weeks!!
_______________________________________________________

**Rules:**

* Victor will win the amount of Reddit Gold in the 'Gold Pot'
* If two or more people have the same CORRECT predictions for the game, the winner will be the person closest with their tiebreak answer. 
* If there is no clear winner (no one guesses right or two or more entrants have the same prediction and result to the tiebreak question, the gold will be added to the 'gold pot' carry over to the following week)
* First 70 entrants only
* One entry per person
* Entry shuts an hour before kick off if 50 entrants aren't found
* Entrants accounts must be older than 3 months
* No obviously edited answers (when the * appears)
* These posts will hopefully be weekly (funds permitting), but will not be posted at the same time each week to hopefully catch only /r/Liverpoolfc lurkers.
* This is obviously in it's infancy so there will be teething problems, please be patient with me.

I really didn't think I even had a shot with her and then suddenly we were out drinking last night and I was about to take her home and boom we start kissing and it escalated from there. 

I'm a 22 y/old typical male but seriously all today my stomach has been in fucking knots and I cannot stop thinking about it. If someone has some kind of magic way I can stop feeling constantly sick (I have no idea what emotion is causing this) and stop constantly replaying it in my head please, please, please fucking tell me. I'm going mad. I don't think she is interested in doing anything further. I really just want to see her again and spend some time with her to make sure it's not weird. 

I have just come out of a really long relationship also where I was kinda done with it a long time ago. I haven't really felt any emotions this strong in a few years. Is this normal for a man of my age? When I first kissed her my heart nearly fell out my chest it was goin like the clappers! 

Sorry this is a really scatty post and a bit all over the place, my problem is that she's the one I usually tell shit like this too and now I can't and I don't really have anywhere else to put this but knew I needed to get this out. I keep hanging on my phone waiting for her to message back and shit. I feel like a childish idiot. 

I swear to god kissing her after being pretty much the closest of friends for 7ish years was the biggest endorphin spike I've ever had. Her sock is still on my bedroom floor. I think it's mocking me. 

I am quite drunk so I hope this made sense, thank fuck for predictive text or this would be gibberish.

Some background, I'm a first time buyer, I have a DIP from Nationwide and have put an offer in on a house which was accepted. Please help me ease my mind and hopefully answer some questions I have or offer any advice if you can

Some specifics:

* I'm 28, earning £25k salary and £3k guaranteed bonus/on call.

* I have £5200 in a [Nationwide Save to Buy ISA](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/save-to-buy-isa/features-and-benefits) which will be used as my deposit. I'll be given £500 cashback reward when this ISA is converted to a mortgage with Nationwide
I'll have another £800 cash which I can add to this deposit or use to pay for any fees (I'm not sure which)

* My offer was accepted at £100,500 (My LTV is 5.17%)

* I have no debt except for £300 left on a student loan (I have arranged a DD with SF to pay this off from November onwards). No outstanding loans, I own my car outright and theres nothing on my CC

* I earn £1750 per month after tax and I'm spending £350 on rent + bills, £350-400 on food/fuel/entertainment/misc. I'm left with £1000 - £1100 per month after outgoings.

* 12% of my salary (6% from my employer) is going into a pension so I don't need to worry about this


I'm looking at the 2 year fixed FTB mortgage over 25 years from Nationwide which has a 4.99% initial rate. The £500 fee for this will be waived as part of their first time buyer deal except for a £100 admin charge I believe. The monthly payments for this mortgage is £554 which would rise to £670 a month if rates increased to 7%

* I've budgeted around £220 for bills (including house + content insurance) so about £1100 in outgoings per month leaving me with £670 left. I'm planning on saving some of this and overpaying my mortgage.

* I'm anticipating around £1000 in solicitor fees/surveys, I know Nationwide will pay some of these fees but I don't know the exact details yet. I've also considered white goods and furniture.

Some thoughts

* Do these figures sound reasonable?
* Have I missed anything out?
* Would these figures be ok to pass the affordability checker with the new mortgage applications?
* Can I haggle my mortgage rates with my bank during my interview? 

I'm kinda flying solo here and don't really have anyone knowledgeable to talk to about this so I really appreciate any input you have.",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,default,First time buyer - worried!,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2g56kx/first_time_buyer_worried/

I am looking to buy a 2 bedroom place with a maximum budget of around £180,000. Ideally, I would like to buy a house but realistically, it will probably be a nearly new flat as there aren't many suitable houses within my budget. I would like to rent out the second bedroom, hopefully to a friend but potentially to a stranger in order to provide a bit more spare money/overpay on the mortgage and because I prefer to have the company. I have a friend who would be interested in renting out a room but nothing has been agreed.

I would be able to fund the mortgage, bills, living expenses etc without the rental income so it wouldn't be critical to have it rented out at all times.

Would I need to declare this to the bank when applying for a mortgage? If so, how are banks likely to perceive it?

What do I need to do to a) keep it all above board and b) protect myself and any potential tennant? Are deposits, written contracts etc generally considered necessary when renting out to friends? As far as I understand it, there is no requirement to use a deposit protection scheme for such an arrangement?

The room would probably rent out for £300-320 a month including bills so the income would fall below the Rent a Room Scheme threshold of £4,250 so presumably there would be no tax payable on the income? I presume that would also mean that nothing would be tax deductable either?

From this, we can see she obviously has something to do with being able to control his regeneration. The timing all works out since we always get the big ol' thing about a year earlier than when it's actually important (mostly talking about how we met Clara a year before we really found out who she was). So the theory is this. 

Missy is a timelord (a sister of Karn), the promised land is Karn. The sisters of Karn can trigger regeneration and save people as stated in The Night of the Doctor. The reason that it is heaven is because you can chose when to die, change your face, and essentially be anything you want to be. After the Sisters of Karn help the Doctor regenerate into the 'War Doctor', they have a permanent attachment to him, which also completely explains how the Doctor can regenerate more than twelve times! The Sisterhood is always looking out for him and allowing him to regenerate. This is why everyone else who has supposed to be dead appears on Karn; because the sisterhood brought them back for some still unknown reason. My theory on this is because the sisterhood is trying to bring back Gallifrey by meeting everyone who the doctor has let die, somehow blackmailing him and forcing him to bring back the timelords once and for all. 

**PS**  If I look back on this in a year or five and Im right I better get some credit please and thank you ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,Best theory about Missy I've come up with.

I'm wondering, has Doctor Who ever touched upon theology in this context before? Things like Heaven, God, (non-weeping) Angels, and demons almost never come up with out being explained in a sci-fi way.

Now, I'm mostly a NuWho guy. I've seen a lot of the Classic Who on Netflix but even if I watched it all there's still plenty not on there, plus I've rewatched every NuWho episode countless times so I'm only ""sorta"" well versed in the classic lore but strong on new lore. 

Anyways in NuWho the only examples of this I can think of are, obviously The Impossible Planet/Satan Pit (my personal favorite two parter) and in the first season of Torchwood when Jack faces Abbadon. Also in my eyes the ""devil"" from Satan Pit and Abbadon are one and the same (with a few inconsistencies). But am I forgetting some? Is, specifically Judeo-Christian, theology ever a plot point in Classic Who? 

I know it's probably not going to literally be Heaven, but if it actually was I'm wondering if there's any precedent for that.

I have just discovered that my Student Finance situation has been reassessed after the fact meaning I am no longer eligible for the money I received last year and spent.

I realise that all this was likely in the contract and I have little I can do about that, yet there is one part that bothers me. The Tuition Loan goes straight from Student Finance to the University I attend, this too was pulled and I received an e-mail shortly afterwards from the University demanding the Tuition loan in full from me within a week or I will not be able to enrol on year two.

Obviously the internet, despite being a bit of a free-for-all has a huge US bias and so does a lot of our media. Also upfront/heads-up, I'm not meaning to be offensive or patronising or demeaning with anything I am saying here.

I wasn't really of an age to remember much of 9-11 at the time or really, the world beforehand either. Obviously Muslims have come to be vilified as a result of it, and airport security is tighter, but what else has changed? Americans seem horrified (or, come together) by the very mention of it. I'm not sure if its just an American bias to their own country, or a close-mindedness, but, I saw in an article earlier today how 9-11 was compared to say, the 2004 Tsunami which killed so many people and how we don't talk about a post-tsunami world; or how so many civilians have been killed in Iraq as a result of the war and people tend to shy away from that topic too. 13 years on it is still touted as solely a great American tragedy; yet many other people around the world have been affected by the consequences and following actions. 
Why is this? Is it deliberate?

We met on another island, a much hotter island, a long time ago and we have forged a friendship that has spanned years and might now span a border. When I go to visit him I have strange conversations with him and his friends; I have conversations about their country’s future as if they are actually involved in it as opposed to being silent participants. They talk about politics as if they have a say in it, as if they actually have an opportunity to decide not only their future but their countries future.
It’s refreshing and remarkable and completely alien to me. This is what democracy should be- inclusive and engaging, “were all in this together” seems to be a potential reality in Scotland instead of a hilarious-if-it-wasn’t-so-sad Tory lie as it is in Britain.
He and his friends talk about their futures, not with the resigned acceptance that my English and Welsh friends speak of them with, but with passion and trepidation. They talk about their futures as if they could be anything they choose to make them.
Current and recent British Governments have taught my generation that democracy in Britain barely works and that politics is completely inaccessible to anyone but the elite. I watched as people protested against the disastrous war in Iraq on an unprecedented scale but were then ignored. I was there the day that students and teenagers protested against a rise in tuition fees and a betrayal of an electoral pledge made directly to the youth of the nation. On that day I watched as the government’s police beat us down like dogs in the street, I watched grown men on police horses charge teenage girls and confine us to the indignity of kettling. That was the message the government sent to a whole British generation about democracy: you can have whatever you want as long as it’s what the government of millionaires wants. The full consequences of that selfishness are still waiting to appear but were ominously hinted at by 2011’s summer riots. The message that democracy doesn’t work is a phenomenally dangerous message to send to a generation of debt ridden, well-educated young people.
The United Kingdom is a construct steeped in imperialism and hereditary royalty. The weight of this past, having not been shaken off through, peaceful or otherwise, struggle casts a long shadow over the nation to this day. We still don’t have a written constitution, we are ruled by a political elite drawn from a narrow number of private schools, an unelected second chamber and a royal family that still holds unwarranted political sway. The very presence of the Royal Family tacitly condones elitism. A privately educated wealthy elite that only makes up 7% of Britain currently makes up 71% of senior judges, 62% of senior armed forces and 55% of permanent secretaries. That is the legal, military and political power bases of the UK all ran by people that went to the same schools as each other. Add these figures to the “cabinet of millionaires” and the raft of career politicians from the same backgrounds and schools and you get to the root problem of British society – that we haven’t actually come that far from the days of the aristocracy.
This truth is increasingly obscured by UK youth employment figures and improving economic statistics that are wafted by biased, privately owned media like smoke screens in front of a docile, financially castrated public to hide or help ignore the financial instability and growing alienation of an entire generation from the nation, and from Westminster, that will undoubtedly form the narrative of our times. The political class of Britain taught my generation that gaining change through the system, though sorely needed, is all but impossible and the people of Scotland watched them ignore us or beat and arrest us. So now Scotland is trying to leave the system, the momentum of the Yes campaign is accelerated by the grassroots support and young people, the very people politicians ignore and continue to ignore.
If Scotland stays in the United Kingdom, what awaits it? Austerity, the continuing privatization of Britain at the expense of the working class, the sale of national assets and services, the creeping dismantling of the welfare state, disastrous and pointless foreign wars, necessary and expensive foreign wars and, most heinous of all, the continuing erosion of participation and belief in democracy and more youth nihilism.
The new wave of politicians that also await a Scotland in the Union are now more removed from the rest of society than ever. They mostly have limited interchangeable professional backgrounds and even more limited social backgrounds. They are identikit “career” politicians with the new generation sometimes adding a touch of “they’re the best looking of a bad bunch” looks to the mix. They no longer have rich (in the original sense of the word) and varied backgrounds but similar, interchangeable – regarding school, university or political persuasion- backgrounds. How much in common does the majority of the country- from the schemes of Scotland and council estates of Liverpool to the suburbs of Kent have in common with these people? None. They have proved themselves in neither hard graft, nor gritty conflict, nor shrewd business. They have only proved themselves adept at Westminster backslapping and backstabbing. They have lived isolated and for the most part privileged lives where hugging a hoody is a risk free endeavor and eating a pasty is a novelty. To anyone outside of the Westminster bubble these people’s position of power is as inexplicable as their reason for being there and the lack of accessibility to politics for the average person only further degrades faith in British democracy.
In Scotland though, the independence debate is igniting a fire in the banal embers of the democratic process. A whole country is having a realistic say in how their country will be governed outside of the ethically and morally bankrupt con-dem-lab political world of the United Kingdom.
The island I met my Scottish friend on also sought independence from Britain and was subjected to the same barrage of fear mongering rhetoric that, once you peel away the fear, is merely a list of bureaucratic and administrative intricacies. Support for the Yes campaign is only boosted by the No campaigns tactics. Its constant use of fear, that oft wielded tool of the Conservative, only serves to further push the grass roots supporters towards the yes vote. The arguments of the No campaign are tinged with images of an economic apocalypse that is an insult to the intelligence and industrious character of the Scottish people, or for that matter any people. The No campaign has successfully turned the campaign into a choice between Conservative fear and Scottish courage.
This leads us to an interesting question. Why does the right of Britain want to keep Scotland? David Cameron has an obvious and vain personal desire to not be the Prime Minister that “let Scotland leave”, forever tarnishing his unremarkable premiership. After all, Scotland constantly and consistently votes majority Labour. Why would the right not want to dispense of an immense left power base? Is it because a Yes vote will mean that, north of the wall, the people are instantly rid of the City of London and its corrupting greedy influence, the hereditary second chamber, the poisonous and elite-legitimising influence of the royals, the public school network, Britain’s chronic wealth imbalance and all of those other forces that are woven into the fabric of the British state but superfluous to its function and hindering to its progress? It is because the rest of us left in the Union will look over the wall to those who refuse to kneel, and will see that a better way is possible. It’s just a shame that we are going to have to lose a part of our nation to realise this, but this shows just how entrenched the current system has become.
Scottish independence is about a lot more than self determination for Scotland. It is about breaking away from the silent and accepted inequality of the UK. It is about a genuine step into the 21st century. It is about leaving the 4th most unequal country in the world and living in a country were 1% of the population does not hold as much wealth as 55% of the population. An independent Scotland can satisfy its population’s desire for social progress and give people a meaningful opportunity to change their lives through democracy. It is putting everyone back into the democratic process and letting young people feel like they have a part to play in the crafting of their country’s and their own future.
Will it be an uncertain future? Yes (but why is that a bad thing? Uncertainty is the foundation of the new). Will it be hard work? Yes. Will it be worth it? Yes, if Scotland wants it to be.
Vote yes Scotland. Do it for us all, north and south of Hadrian’s Wall. Go your own way and show us all that there is a better way, that democracy doesn’t just belong to the rich and that we can all have a say in the future of our nations. Vote yes to rid yourselves of this nepotistic, greedy, corrupt perversion of democracy that we have now. Vote yes and show us that there can be a fairer society. Vote yes and show this generation that they can change things and that it can be done through the democratic process. Stay and you will have a future of austerity, cuts and a widening wealth divide. Leave and you will have a chance to save your young people’s futures by giving them all something to build in a new Scotland.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Why a Young Englishman Wants Scottish Independence (xpost from /r/scottishindependence),0,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2g6qm1/why_a_young_englishman_wants_scottish/

* Computerise primary care in the NHS, we have the technology, lets use it.

* Drop student fees, pass cost on to a fully nationalised student loans company.

* Break down planning permission laws to a minimum in London, submit possible designs to a vote by surrounding residents

* Paint the concrete jungle. Assign areas of plain concrete to art schools to decorate for the country's pleasure. Turn motorways into drive through galleries, old blocks of flats into giant canvases, underpasses into artistic havens, etc.

* Legalise and regulate cannabis and natural hallucinogens. Decriminalise possession of all other drugs. Make dealing of very harmful drugs; heroin, crack, crystal-meth, 

* End faith schools. Give them a 5 year grace period to end their nonsense.

* Give all police officers chest cameras, obliged to always be worn under normal circumstances.

* Raise tax rate in the £150k + bracket 

* Divert agriculture subsidies to proven vertical farming technologies in and around main cities. Compensate the now jobless farmers with money to buy their land, then turn it into a national park, and hire them to reforest it.

Glory Glory Harry Hotspur
By Dan Sardella

Just outside of London there was a bird who went by the name of Harry Hotspur. Harry was a hard worker, and he made the best of what he had. In the times when Harry wasn’t working so darn hard he often day dreamed about doing great things, and hoping his hard work would eventually turn into something glorious.  This was kind of spurred on by the fact that Harry always had pressure from his nosy neighbor to do better. Harry’s neighbor was Callum the Cannon, and had just recently moved from the other side of town.
 
Callum was originally from a place called Woolwich. In Woolwich Callum had space to do as he wished… however he got quite lonely which lead to the move north, to a place called Highbury. This usually wouldn’t mean much of anything except for the fact that both Callum and Harry were owners of their very own teams in the Bunny Premier League. The move didn’t sit well with Harry because he liked having the only team on the north side of the city. Callum didn’t much care for Harry’s thoughts because Callum liked winning and that was it. He would do anything it took, such as luring Harry’s players away, or giving his players more carrots a week, because he paid off all the farmers in the area. Through all of this though Harry just kept working hard to do the best he could for his team.  

Now the Bunny Premier League was the most serious of all the Leporid football leagues in the United Kingdom, and one of the most prestigious in the world. It rivaled leagues such as La Liga Liebre of Spain, the Fussball-Kaninchen of Germany, Ligue Lapin of France, and the Coniglietto A of Italy. The most exciting part of this is that every year the top teams from these leagues and a few others met in a tournament called the ERFA (European Rabbit Football Association) Champions Cup. Harry had always dreamed about taking his team to the Champions Cup, but unfortunately his nosy neighbor kept getting in the way. In the Bunny Premier League the four top teams make it in to the cup, and it always seemed as if Harry and Callum’s teams were battling it out for fourth and fifth. Other teams like Frank’s Blue Lions (who were a team from just off the river Thames) or Stevie’s Reds of Liverpool would be fighting at the top, with the perennial big spenders from Manchester (Wayne’s Red Devils and Vincent’s Eagles). No matter what though recently it came down between Harry’s Lilywhites and Callum’s (rather selfishly) self-titled Cannons for fourth and fifth place.
 
Harry and his team over the years had gotten very close even making it to fourth one year, led by one particularly spritely hare from Wales named Gareth. Gareth quickly became Harry’s favorite player but unfortunately he decided to chase his childhood dream of playing for Los Galacticos from Madrid. Since Gareth left Harry had been wishing he could make it back to the Champions Cup, but every year Callum had been spending more and more money to get better players than Harry could afford. Callum had even had a new stadium built to bring more fans to his games which in turn made it even harder for Harry to attract players to his club, which looked much smaller in comparison. Harry kept at it though and managed to convince a few relatively young but promising talents to his team; the main ones being Christian a snowshoe hare from Denmark, Bobby a bunny from Spain, Hugo hare from France, and Erik a particularly tricky rabbit from Argentina.  Due to this large gap in spending, Callum had begun to discount Harry and his team, and sent all his players on vacation to Brazil in the summer. Harry however had his team practicing hard and working towards the new season. 

As the weeks past though it looked as if Callum had not made a mistake in his judgment and his team was in fourth place just as expected. The players had even begun to share the same sentiment as their owner, discounting their cross town rivals as real threats. Harry however knew that if his team kept their heads down and working hard they could achieve their dream of making the Champions Cup. The weeks kept counting down, until the last week of the season. Harry and his team had managed to pull back the gap between fourth and fifth to just two points. Just as luck would have it, their last opponent of the season was Callum and his Cannons. This meant that all Harry’s Lilywhites would have to do is win the game against the Cannons and they would achieve their goal.  
So there it was, the stage was set for Harry to take on his cross town rival Callum for a chance to play against the best teams in Europe. The game which was to be played at the Lilywhite’s hometown field off of White Hart Lane, in Tottenham was sizing up to be a fierce and riveting struggle, especially as Callum had said before the game “I’m not too concerned about Harry’s team, they just don’t have the quality we do anywhere on the field.”
Harry and his team had heard these comments, but he was not phased by Callum’s pompous comments. He wouldn’t let his team be phased either as he told them “Keep our dreams and goals in mind, and work as hard as you can out there. For the game is about glory, and the glory will be ours.”

The game kicked off on a warm May afternoon, with Harry’s team out in their signature lilywhite uniforms and Callum having his team in cardinal red. It was a nip and tuck affair for the early stages of the game. Christian and Erik combined with a few good chances, as well as Bobby getting very close but missing the target. The Cannons had a few good chances as well as one particularly quick hare from Chile named Alexis was giving Hugo the most trouble. As clock wound down towards half time, Alexis happened to get the ball in a very good position and put it by Hugo as cool as you like. After the goal, Callum called over to Harry saying “Want to call it now? You guys just aren’t up to it this game… It could save you more embarrassment.” 

Harry not being one to give in politely rebuffed Callum’s impolite banter saying “Glory is rarely easy, and being a worthy opponent I would expect nothing less from you.” 
Callum was quite perplexed at the way Harry responded. Not knowing whether to thank him for being so polite, or make another comment, but he just left it be saying “We will see what the second half brings…” 
Harry back in the locker room with his team saw the faces of Christian, Erik, Hugo, and especially Bobby beginning to sink as they lost the momentum going into halftime. Harry looked at each and everyone one of his players. He said to them “Look at your shirts and listen to the crowd out there… They came to see you, the proud Lilywhites, hear the echoes of glory being sent your way. Go out there and take it!” 

Harry’s team came out for halftime with a renewed sense of purpose, and playing harder than they had all season were actually managing to bring momentum back into their favor during the second half.  They quickly found a great chance at getting back into the game as Erik had been dribbling around the Cannons penalty area as he tricked one of the Cannons more impulsive defenders Laurent into making an ill-advised challenge causing a foul. It was in the perfect spot for Christian to set up and take it. With the ball sitting off towards the goal keepers right hand side about twenty-five yards away, Christian stood waiting for the referee’s whistle. As he stood listening to the echoes of the crowd, he thought about all the hard hours he had put into training for situations just like this and in a moment it was all gone. The game, the stadium, the crowd, even the goalkeeper had disappeared, and he was back on a field in Denmark with a ball and a particularly lonely net. Then as he had a million times when he was back home, he hit the ball just so, and it sailed up and then dipped violently down into the top right corner of the net. In a flash he was back, and his team was all running towards him as he had given them a chance, a hope to seize glory. 

After Christian’s stunning display of skill, the game settled down for a long stretch of the second half. Callum had instructed his team to be content with what they had as everyone knew the draw would be enough to keep them in fourth. Harry however had told his team to push harder and dig deeper, as they knew all too well that they needed to score at least one more goal. As the minutes ticked on the atmosphere around the stadium became hushed, with a sense of urgency. However as fate would have it in the 89th minute, Erik snatched the ball from a Cannons defender just past half field. He was stranded by himself in the middle of three more Cannons players… Just as Christian had when he stepped up to the ball earlier Erik had flashes of all the hard work that he had put towards this moment, and by what seemed to be another worldly sense of grace, he dribbled past all three of the stunned Cannon players. This put Erik through on goal with just the keeper to beat. Erik positioned the ball so that his left foot could make the best contact possible with the ball, and fired for the top corner of the net. As the ball sailed the Cannons keeper leapt from his perch in the center of the net, diving with power and agility to the corner Erik shot for, and managed to get his hand to the ball pushing it straight up and seemingly dashing the Lilywhites hopes. As he fell to the ground you could almost see a look of arrogance on his face. This was short lived however, as he failed to realize that the ball was still in play, and that Bobby the Lilywhites striker was in perfect position to put it in to the empty net that was left for him. 

In a word was followed was pure elation, as the ball gracefully rolled into the unguarded net. The stadium erupted into echoes and cheers, as the players all swarmed to Bobby to congratulate him. The referee seeing that time had gone past the 2 minutes of added time blew his whistle and the game had ended, before the Cannons could even put the ball back into play. Harry and his Lilywhites had won the game, through hard work and determination they had achieved their goals. Harry left the bench and walked over to shake Callum’s hand as he was a gracious winner, but when he got to the Cannon’s bench he was nowhere to be found. As Harry would find out later, Callum couldn’t bear facing Harry after what he said before halftime, so he had gone straight to the visiting locker room. This didn’t sit well with Harry as he had always been told to be gracious and victory and defeat, but it didn’t stop him from enjoying the moment at hand. Harry enjoyed the celebrations with his team, as they all surrounded him and encouraged the fans to join in in cheers of “Glory, glory Harry Hotspur!” For they all knew without Harry’s words of encouragement and dedication to hard work they would’ve never made it this far.

Am moving to live with my friend in Brighton at the end of October. 
Ideally,I want to find wok with a law firm, business, anything basically where I would have the chance to observe the Big Bosses at work and learn from them,a step up. Am not a student so can and want to work full time, I am willing to go above and beyond and do anything as long as I get to learn about something bigger than how to make frappucinos. My friend, who I'm going to be living with, wants to start a business sometime in the future,but for that I need first to learn how that works.

Any jobs that require a more intelligent and creative approach would be welcome, like assistants, receptionists, administrators etc. 

I'm fairly proficient in English, Russian and Latvian, and have OK organizational skills, and have an eye for detail and would be enthusiastic about gaining new skills and maintaining a high job performance. 
If you know anyone who would hire me or have any relevant advice, please contact me :)

Edit:Thanks for the advice, I deleted the email!

Hope everyone's had a good week, in or out of work! Things are getting busier over here, so I thought I'd do a round up of what I've got going on, what's coming up, and maybe get some updates from the community to see if there's anything you'd be interested in or would like me to look into if you've got a specific skill set you think would be a good match for Sky!

So, position wise, I've got 4 that I'm currently helping to recruit for. They are:

1. Shift Manager with the Sky Network Operations team
1. Enterprise Network Engineer
1. Procurement Manager
1. Personal Assistant  for Sky Network Services

If you or anyone you know works within these positions, and you (or they) fancy checking out how they fit into Sky, then drop me a PM and I can go through the job spec and salary and what have you.

Also, there's an ongoing requirement for web developers with node.js and angular.js (and general good javascript experience) to come to the team in Osterley. I'm planning on going along to a couple of meetups next month, including Find A Tech Job In London and a few tech specific groups, to talk about working at Sky and the kinds of projects that we're working on over here. So if any of you guys are members of a meetup group that you think it would be worth me popping my head into, or want to come and (shock horror!), meet in person to talk about you and Sky, I'll have more details nearer the time

As it's Friday, if you guys want to post on here what you're interested in job wise, and want me to look into upcoming opps in that area over the next week or so, I'm more than happy to jot them all down and at the very least ask the question! I've gotten back to a few of you, but if I haven't, please bear with me while I find out who the best point of contact is.

I'm also trying to get /r/londonforhiremeetups going, so if you haven't subscribed yet, but want to and have some ideas on how we could get that train rolling, I'd appreciate any input at all. Even if it's just to mouth off about recruiters being crap.

In the meantime, I hope everyone has a great weekend, and I look forward to hearing from anyone either interested in the positions I'm currently hiring for, or just generally want to throw their hat in the ring and see what comes back

I've been looking at one bed flats or flat shares on the internet; but I did a weeks work there last week and stayed with a mate of mine; upon leaving I got his landlord's number. 


Rang the guy yesterday and he's only got 2 beds on the go. They are being renovated at the minute but he says there's one that is almost done and will only need finishing touches if I move in around the 26th. 

He usually only rents to couples but says he wouldn't have a problem if myself and another reasonable human being shared. 

So I'm just looking to see if there's anyone looking somewhere to live in Edinburgh. The house is in Christian Crescent. He's willing to give a discount for the first month because of the work being done and its definitely non-smoking. Rent is £550/£600 a month. He hasn't decided yet. 

If anyone's looking to live with a late 20s Norn Irish journalist and is about the same age and in employment I'd be looking to try sorting out getting this place as he seems a decent landlord to rent from from what my mate says. 

PM me if you're looking a place to move into at the end of the month and if anyone has any advice on where else to find a flat mate/ a place to live I'd be all ears.

I wish there was a way to easily search my comments, but there's not, so I'll have to summarise what I said before.

A lot of people were raising their eyebrows when Laudrup was sacked for Monk to take over. Quite a number of people went as far as to say that we were run by idiots, and that we were sealing our fate to relegation.

Our current board have been in charge since the depths of League Two. They sat down years ago, said 'this is what we want to achieve, **and this is how we will achieve it**', and have stuck to their guns the whole way. Laudrup had to go because his methods started straying further and further away from this methodology that the club is now entirely based on.

When Huw Jenkins picks a manager, you'd best fucking believe he's got a lot of good reasons why he's doing it. In the Premier League, Everton's Roberto Martínez made his start with us when he was taken from Chester as a player in League Two, Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers came to us after two short, unsuccessful stints with Championship clubs that had left his reputation as essentially a nobody form the failures, while again with the current Manager of the Month we've got someone who wasn't even on the managerial radar when he was appointed.

After being nominated for the award, Garry said he doesn't worry too much about the awards at a personal level, taking them as a reflection of the club as a whole rather than as a statement about himself. I've got to agree; he's proven himself thus far to be an excellent appointment and he has my full support as a club legend, but the fact remains that he's a cog in the works of a club run in a very specific way.

When he was appointed as caretaker and then as full time manager, my reaction was this: I'm not sure at all about this, but Huw's picked him out so I'll put my trust in him. That logic has not let me down yet. Everyone likes to think their club is special - we're not the most unique club in the world but I do like to think we're evidence that you can do quite well in the modern game doing things 'the right way'.

It's a ramble here, but I feel like our board deserve widespread recognition for the excellent work they've done for the club and this city. I'll be watching the film about them ([Jack to a King](http://www.jacktoaking.com/)) in the cinema in the next week, and those of you in the UK who take an interest in the game at large I really recommend you go and watch it, or find a copy online if you can't get a showing near you.

*For those of us here on /r/swanseacity, I'd also like to add a little bit extra, particularly those who have taken up the club from abroad since we got into the top flight. I can't stress enough how key our board are to being the club we are today. If you want to get a bit of the story now before this new film gets onto the internet, you should watch '[Swansea City: The Fall and Rise](http://movzap.com/qsqyfsx5kfqk)'.*

*In all honesty, I hate modern football. However, so long as we continue going forward in the manner we have thus far, I won't lose my love of my local club.*",false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,null,null,self,A ramble about the Swansea City board,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/swanseacity/comments/2g7exv/a_ramble_about_the_swansea_city_board/

* The Blues won both meetings with Swansea in the league last season 1-0.
* The Swans did win 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in the League Cup in January 2013, however, with Michu and Danny Graham on the scoresheet.
* Swansea's only league victory at Chelsea came in the very first meeting between the sides back in 1925.
* The Swans' last league win over Chelsea was a 3-0 Division One success at their old Vetch Field home in April 1981.
* This is only the second time in Premier League history that the top two sides in the table have met as early as this in the season.

Be a part of the most interesting technical team around!

Our outlook is moulded around the principle of recruiting only candidates who combine breadth and depth of outlook and experience. We do not recruit people to slot into a particular technical role, but all-rounders familiar with a broad range of
operating environments, programming languages, etc., combined with a high level of software engineering expertise.

**Skills &amp; Requirements**

A good Shifty will have the following skills:

* Knowledge of algorithms, data structures, complexity
* Experience with different programming paradigms (definitely OO, at least one of functional or declarative, and any others a bonus!)
* Versed in several programming languages
* Experience of all stages in the project life cycle
* Good Unix and Windows skills

Other characteristics we expect:

* You care about technology
* You know what makes projects succeed
* You have a pretty good idea how to stop them failing ;-)

All Shifties are required to act as client-facing Lead Developers, managing all technical aspects of a project from its inception through to delivery. This has led to an ethos of using the right tool for the job which is reflected in the range of
technologies we use; we have built projects that are deployed on Unix, Windows, Android &amp; iOS, and have used C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, Scala, Ruby, Objective C, F#, Scheme and Erlang in production.

Our client list is also broad, and includes companies from the financial, telecommunications, retail, broadcast, publishing and technology sectors.

**About LShift Ltd**

LShift is possibly the best agile software development company in London. It is small but, we like to think, close to perfectly formed. Our company is home to some of the best developers in the UK - not only in our opinion, but in the opinion of the head of technology incubation at one of the largest software companies in the world, who described us as his ""European brain pool"".

LShift was set up to make sure that it would be a good place for smart people to work. The day to day routine is as flexible and informal as possible to give you room to manage yourself as you see fit, and you'll spend your days working with like-minded people. We are so confident about this that when we interview you we will also arrange for you to meet the rest of the team socially and hear directly for yourself what it's like to work with us.

We designed and built RabbitMQ, the leading open source implementation of the AMQP open standard and we continue to provide services around RabbitMQ and a number of types of messaging and integration technologies.

We try to reward staff in direct proportion to their skills and commitment. To this end we run bonus, healthcare and pensions schemes. Our offices are based in sunny Hoxton, in central London, surrounded by every type of modern urban amenity. However, the biggest benefit in joining us is the chance to work in a truly stimulating environment.

LShift is a great place to work if you love a challenge and are fed up with conventional thinking and working in teams constrained by that.

**How to apply**

If you are interested in applying please email us at elaine@lshift.net with your CV, some code samples and a nice covering letter, as we can often tell quite a lot from that.
