I have numerous clients from major markets all across the US and even a few in Australia and New Zealand.

I am well versed in the latest SEO best practices, random CMS's you've never heard of, and my company even requires us to spend 4 hours a week doing research. I'm also in charge of 4 ""junior"" strategists. Monthly reports and strategy calls with clients are other things my job requires; so its all very hands on.

I got my masters from an uni in London, and I've been aching to get back into the city ever since I moved back to the states - since I couldn't find a company willing to sponsor me fresh out of uni.

But now that I have experience under my belt, I'm hoping that sponsorship will come much easier.

So here are my questions:

* Is SEO/internet marketing something companies are normally willing to sponsor experienced foreigners for work visas?

* What is the pay for SEO Analysts/Strategists/Managers/Executives/etc in London? I currently make $40,000 (~ £24,000) - which allows me enough money to afford a house where I live in the US.

Currently, I'd like to see through several projects at my current job, so I'm looking to do some hard job searching later this summer. 

I'm looking for these basic questions to be answered before I proceed further or make any commitments.

She is not voting in the Italian EU election and instead wishes to cast her vote here in the UK, since she lives here.

We were surprised to find that she was denied access to the EU ballot paper to vote in the EU election even though it says on [aboutmyvote.co.uk](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/who_can_register_to_vote.aspx) that:
&gt;Citizens of the European Union (who are not Commonwealth citizens or Citizens of the Republic of Ireland) can vote in European and local elections in the UK

I showed this page to the clerks and they said no, that's not the case because she is on their list as a ""G"" and ""G""s can only vote in local elections.

When pushed, they said to call the election office which we did. The person on the phone said that my friend should have registered to vote for the EU election in the UK in advance.

The thing is, that she did deliberately contact the council to register to vote in Oxford at the end of April, well in advance, so that there would be time to set everything in order. She was promptly registered and thought that was that.

But according to the lady on the phone, she was supposed to have been sent some sort of extra form to sign in order to declare that she would be voting for the EU elections in the UK only and not in Italy. Which is fair enough, you're not allowed to vote twice. But no such letter ever arrived. She received a letter confirming her registration but nothing else. We have checked and double checked all the mail. Now it is too late to register as such and obviously also too late to go home to Italy to vote. So essentially she is now being denied her right to vote at all in this EU election!

The rules on having to sign off on where she is intending to vote is fair enough, but she was not told about this prerequisite in advance so she never knew to expect a letter or chase one up. And this information is not available on any website I have found. No where on the aboutmyvote or Oxford council site does it say that you have to perform extra registration to vote in the EU election.

This is simply not acceptable and a mockery of our democratic process. If possible, she wants to complain to someone to sort this out and be able to vote, but the people at the polls and the lady on the phone were very unhelpful. **Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions on who to contact and what to do to try and sort this out?**

They will be pretty stat heavy, and although stats only give us a glimpse of the real story- they can be used an an effective analysis tool that will show us how our players have reacted to the Martinez system, and the parts of their game that have changed most. 

I am hoping that the analysis will throw up a few surprises, as looking at things in a vacuum can often reveal things we may have missed when immersed in the game. 

Starting with the man between the sticks seems logical. He is our (effective) number 1, and the goalkeeper positon is probably the least taxing stat wise. So.. Here it goes

The most important stat on the list is undoubtedly the 15 clean sheets that Howard has kept this season. Whilst it is unlikely that he has improved significantly at his technical abilities during that time, it is probably more indicative of how effective our system has been, and the strong start to the season we had at the back (which was rare under Moyes). 

His number of saves is also up, and his saves per goal conceded is increased; that means we are actually giving up about 0.5 extra shots per game; but less are going in. This could be put down to a number of things, but I feel that better defensive positioning from our deep midfielders has contributed hugely to a high defense, and forced the opposition into taking more frustrated shots at us in less opportune positions. I will hopefully go into a bit more detail about this when I discuss Barry and MccArthy.

What I find somewhat surprising is that the number of passes Howard has made has not shot up. With our more passing based system I expected him to be used as an outlet more than 2.5 times per game- but the reason for this may be his low pass success rate, which means the team are less likely to pass to him. 

One stat of note that was a bit surprising for me is how high Howard figures on the distribution tables. Now I think of it, his throws and goal kicks are consistently good, and time and again he has opened up a flank for a counterattack; but I honestly wouldn't have written this down as a key benefit of

If I compare his 60.4% completion rate to other keepers, he comes up at the middle end of the scale; but low for keepers who play in a passing side: Szczesny sits at 64% and Mignolet at 67%. This is obviously not currently an issue due to how he excels in other areas, but when we are looking to replace Howard in the future, it would be worth looking at a keeper who fits a bit more into the passing mindset.

So got into a debate on FB, need your help!!

H - Vote for whoever you want to today. Or if you don't like any of the candidates, don't vote at all. It's not yet compulsory.

M - May as well go vote for someone since it is proportional voting, so by not voting you are allowing the people who vote to get more members in as they obtain a bigger share of the votes that were cast. So by all the Mainstream people getting 70% of the vote, of which only 20% of the country vote for, they get more MEPs than if they only got 10% of the votes if 80% of people voted.

H - But if you don't like any of the candidates, or in fact, have equal contempt for them all, it is pointless endorsing any of them. You wouldn't buy a product you don't want.

M - So you are saying of all the candidates not a single one presents a folio that you believe in? whether it be the Christian party, Pirate Party or Animal Rights party?

H - We're not talking about me, but it is indeed possible that many people don't want to vote for anybody. The sanctimony of telling people 'you should vote' is unbearable.

M - Fair enough, but I see it as by not voting you are hardly making the parties sit up and go 'By god no-one is voting' and they get to retain power by default. 100 years agot women could not vote, in America blacks could not vote, in many countries of the world today, many people cannot vote, they have no power to hear their voice be heard, But yeah, lets not vote, cos fuck the politicians you know...

H - They protested for the right to vote. And the right not to vote, which is just as precious. Plus, if somebody is not interested and knows nothing about politics, I'd rather they just didn't vote, rather than vote for whomever their parents/mates tell them to vote for.

M - Maybe they should educate themselves about the parties? by not voting you simply allow the most popular party among a dwindling pool of voters to obtain all the power, hence how BNP managed to get seats last year.

H - People should educate themselves on a whole bunch of things. But they don't. And if they don't, not much point in them voting.

M - Well if hey dont want to work we should cut off their Welfare too? not paying tax and NI? better cut off their NHS treatments and support too..

H - No idea what that paragraph means, sorry

M - The statement about ' People should educate themselves on a whole bunch of things. But they don't. And if they don't, not much point in them voting.' feels like you may as well say 'these plebs do not know what is best for them, they should leave it to us better educated people to decide for them'

H - Your words. But what's the point in taking part in a poll if you don't know anything about the subject?

Although Bryan Oviedo closed the season with the highest overall rating, he did it while appearing in just 9 games. From there, it seems that Seamus Coleman coming in at 7.54 over 26 games was our player of the season (or at least 29 games).

My thoughts are that the Tardis may become overcrowded and character plots (such as Claras) will be difficult to develop over 45-50 min episodes. I would have prefered to see just Clara as the companion, as she has not had a full series to her self and this might just be her last series she is in and i would have liked to see her relationship with the doctor evolve more.

I'll be moving to London from South America (I'm an EU citizen) with my non-EU wife. Her visa status is already solved. We were thinking of going to Dublin, but we like London better and it appears to be easier to get a job there, since we have more connections.

We are young professionals: I'm an economist - most experience on research (~3 years) and a bit in finance and management (1 year) and I have intention to do CIMA courses and get certificated. She's on the IT field (~3 years as well) with CCNA, LPI-2 and ITIL Foundation certifications. We are applying for jobs but I guess we'll have a harder time getting employed from a distance than living there, so we will actively start looking for jobs when we arrive.

We are going with the intention of staying there forever, but if things doesn't work out we still can move back. We are also willing to work on things outside our fields for a while. We both speak portuguese and english, she speaks spanish and I speak a bit of French. We are also musicians, but mostly for fun.

Since we'll be jobseeking we'll need some money to survive on that while. How much do you think it's okay including rent (we are thinking of living on not-so-central London or metro area), food, utilities, transportation and an occasional beer? We're thinking if we can't manage to get a job in 6-8 months we will move elsewhere, so it's the money would be for that period.

The second question is trickier and I don't think it's possible to get an accurate answer: considering our qualifications: how much time do you think it'd take to at least one of us get a job?

- Google of the registration seems to link it with ""spy planes"" used to intercept phones.  

    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8857517/Met-Police-spends-millions-of-pounds-on-  secret-aircraft.html

   One of the planes is apparently a Cessena F04 leased by a company called Nor and the aircraft flying is one of the aircraft allegedly leased.

- Plane has no call sign.

- Seems to have departed from Farnborough airport rather than RAF Northolt which is where the RAF house known fixed wing aircraft that actually do ""light communications"" work  http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/islander.cfm (these aircraft are different to one flying now).

- http://www.pprune.org/spectators-balcony-spotters-corner/536465-no-callsign-over-london.html
  
  Seems to suggest it's doing survey work or something.

- 23:52 looks like it landed at ""London"" Southend Airport http://i.imgur.com/eGwnRdj.jpg

I'm sure anyone who saw a Sinn Fein sample ballot saw how it was laid out, instead of explaining how to actually submit your preferences, they simply had 1, 2, 3 and 4 placed beside their candidates names.  

I worked in the New Lodge today as a poll clerk whilst Sinn Fein ""agents"" as my superior called them waited outside the gates of the building handing out ballots to voters as they came in.  Now I'm from West Belfast, I was born and reared their and so were most of my family, so I'm not trying to insult anyone, but I cannot lie when I say that those voters must be the stupidest crowd I've ever seen.  Half of them thought that the Shinner hand-outs were the actual ballots and tried to submit them, even after we'd handed them the actual ballots, the other half didn't even know that their were two elections going on today or that they were allowed more than one vote on both ballots.  Sinn Fein party members were the only ones sitting at the table for party representatives, they took it in shifts and they all took down notes of who had turned up and who didn't whilst the rest of them waited outside at the gates for **15** hours!

I know, the New Lodge is a safe republican seat, and I know it's one of the most run down areas of Belfast, but that election was pretty eye-opening as to how things are run here.  I've had my sympathies with Sinn Fein for many, many years and I always saw them as dynamic and open despite their bloody past.  But for fuck sake, today all I saw was blind loyalty from people who are currently being fucked out of their homes by developers, I saw many young people who were just voting because they had been told too without thinking.  They trust the party and the party is letting them down, and they can't even get any other options because let's face it, **it's Sinn Fein in the New Lodge**.  If you put up a a poster that didn't feature a former H-block prisoner in their then you'd be chased out by some brick shithouse on wheels.

Here's how I see it

&gt;Under the 1967 Abortion Act, a pregnancy can be terminated legally if two doctors agree that the physical or mental health of the child or the woman is in jeopardy.

Surely a woman's mental and physical health is in jeopardy with every pregnancy?  So there can't ever be a good reason to deny someone an abortion (aside from the odd case where the abortion might be more dangerous due to complications or something).

How is it possible to reasonably enforce the illegality of gender-selective abortion without adding to a woman's mental and physical health risk by telling her she must follow through with the pregnancy?

If for some 'strange' reason the None of the Above option came out on top maybe it would lead to something like the need for a re-election and/or shake up of parties and MPs?

I've been offered a job in Edinburgh and I'm finding it harder and harder to come up with reasons why I shouldn't accept it.

The job itself isn't all that jazzy but the possibility of living abroad again is nearly too much to resist.

Thing is that they're hoping a response from me come monday and I'd have to move there rather soon and I've very little idea what Edinburgh is like.

I'd need to find my own flat and the company won't be able to help too much. The job is located in Stockbridge, not far from Edinburgh Castle (500 or so meters) and a flat not too far from there would be brilliant. My question is, I suppose, is it difficult to get flats in Edinburgh? And the prices/rents, are they high?

Is Edinburgh a nice sort of a place to live and hang out at?

I've plenty of friends in England and it would be splendid to go meet them every now and then. How expensive is it to travel around the UK?

4.2k Solo MMR, 51.4% WR. http://dotabuff.com/players/34957866 

Mostly experience playing Support role 4/5 in scrims and TMM but competent carry would honestly prefer to carry but role rotation is also good. In support roles I really enjoy the strategy element of dota. 

Previous teams: Rasta(i51), DDogs, fl.int, These were just draft teams unfortuently. 

Obviously speak English, I'm 21. 

Previously played with Rasta at iSeries where we came 4th. I can guarantee you a great Io player ;D. Main expectations is to play weekly tournies and train up for next iSeries with ideally gaining some euro contacts for their scrim groups etc. 

Judging from current top placing teams that should be alright if we execute correctly etc. Thats my main goal in getting this team together, have fun with similarly skilled people and achieve a decent placing. Get some xp and move forward.

My hero pool is pretty big, not comfortable with Chen yet. Visage is fine. I'm really strong at drafting and watch a lot of comp dota. Carry wise anything is good. 

Been previously pro at SF4 and other games. I know what eSportz is like and can bring a lot of knowledge to a team. 

Add me via steam and we'll see how we go. gamingninja2 Link: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995223594/

**# who are we?**

There’s a new way to stay in a city. onefinestay is a trusted service for hosts to flexibly share their homes while they’re out of town. We give guests the best bits of a boutique hotel stay inside some of the most distinctive homes around.

**# why does onefinestay need developers?**

As well as continuously improving www.onefinestay.com we’re building a whole bevy of tools to support the very real, very logistical business that depends on technology, from mobile tools to scheduling systems. Here’s a snapshot of some of the things we're currently working on, will be working on soon, or maybe just finished.

* Updating the entire online pre-stay experience for guests (we call it, online check-in)
* Launched a brand new online magazine with custom cms called The Edition
* Developed an authentication and staff management system to handle our ever-growing team
* Completely revamping the entire site to support mobile devices (40% of our traffic comes from iOS)

**# who do we want?**

We're looking for someone who can question the status quo, bring new ideas to the table, see the full potential of a new feature (and push it to realisation), or if necessary tone down something that is getting out of hand. Everyone on the team is a fullstack developer, to some degree. But our django heavy application is moving more and more to the client in order to keep our interfaces as usable as possible. We'd like you to have some experience with client-side frameworks in a production environment, but if yours isn’t in backbone or reactjs, don't worry, there’ll be plenty of time to learn. With that in mind, we’re looking for:

* High-level ability in HTML/CSS (SASS)
* MVC style application development with javascript (backbone, underscore, react)
* Experience with server side frameworks (django, RoR, express)
* Ability to work with our product team to develop high quality user experience
* Strong knowledge of web standards and cross-browser compatibility

There's a bunch of other stuff that will go a long way to get us excited:

* Experience with source control (git, mercurial)
* Experience with agile development methodologies
* Comfortable working with pre-processors such as browserify, React's jsx format
* Experience with CI and automated testing (jenkins, jasmine) 

**# what we can offer you?**

* Competitive salaries
* Stock options
* A social work environment filled to the brim with talented developers
* Your choice of dev environment (on the penthouse floor of our sweet new offices)
* Time to expand and grow your skills

Please apply at the following link:

“Agüero is so powerful he hurts himself. He's the Super Saiyan 2 Trunks of football.”

“DAE Aguero would have won the Golden Boot if he hadn't missed 13 games? These commentators won't shut up.”

&amp;nbsp;

###**Review:**

Everything I write about Sergio Aguero will not be a surprise or controversial to any readers of this subreddit. Aguero’s season is pretty simple to define. When he plays, he’s amazing. His skills on the ball are one of a kind - dancing around players like a math professor doing calculus. His vision for the game is impeccable, rarely getting caught offsides and always seeming to make the right passes or get into the box. His work ethic outweighs that of any forward City have, as if somebody dressed the Energizer bunny in sky blue and with a fancy haircut and irresistible eyes and [smile](https://24.media.tumblr.com/15fe0cff085e5c64ad521fc1a98b10f3/tumblr_n5z9piqLcr1qjexqoo3_r1_250.gif) (Yes, I do have a slight man crush). He rarely goes down in the box, wanting to finish off every chance for himself. Off the field - he is a hilarious, apparently loves Pepsi, and does so much for the club and community. 

However, Sergio’s hamstring has been [hanging out with Stevan Jovetic for too long](http://24.media.tumblr.com/0904915fb5b5a774629a3ea47ec17155/tumblr_n5fhnnK7CD1ttrumdo1_500.png). It may be as though he’s pushing himself too hard to be in the squad every week, but it seems like he plays for sixty minutes and then misses two weeks. I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say, “figure that out.” Plenty will say that without Yaya, City are a different team. Maybe without Aguero, City can still win, but the argument is that WITH Aguero, City are THAT much better. 

Front mid October to the end of November, Aguero went on an immense streak, tallying 12 goals and four assists in nine games - including MOTM performances against West Ham, CSKA Moscow, and Norwich which earned him a perfect 10 WhoScored rating. In his last nine games, however, he only managed two goals. Aguero amassed FIVE ratings of 9+ (now I know WhoScored is not a be all end all, but wow) this season. Even Yaya didn’t do that. 

A slight worry for City fans could be Kun’s performances against Barcelona after barely contributing and coming off after only 45 minutes in a massive match. He picked up a knock, but that performance could likely just be a fluke. 

&amp;nbsp;

###**Summer plans:**
Aguero is in Argentina’s world cup squad with a few other City pals, and will have a lot to prove. Despite his love at City, he isn’t always first choice for Argentina - with Gonzalo Higuain and of course Lionel Messi getting first dibs. Carlos Tevez isn’t this year, and he’s surely ahead of Ezequiel Lavezzi and Rodrigo Palacio. This World Cup could be Kun’s chance to develop into Argentina’s premier forward and bring home another piece of silverware for his (already full) trophy case. A golden boot and second place sounds feasible, no? 

&amp;nbsp;

###**Expectations for next year:**
Short and sweet for Aguero. There’s no doubt he is the best goalscorer on City. If healthy for a full year, he is a perennial choice for the Premier League’s Golden Boot and possibly the best player in Europe. Working with Silva, Nasri, and even a healthy Jovetic will mean more options for goals and more chances.  A full year for Kun could be trouble, though, as once again rumors about Real Madrid and Barcelona are sure to arise. We all know that [Messi and Aguero are best friends](http://31.media.tumblr.com/44ad0ddedae896e762204fbeeab9c25e/tumblr_mu0lk19gVa1rledkoo1_500.gif) and their time spent together in the summer could reaffirm their desire to play together. Let’s hope that it’s Messi who makes the move rather than Aguero.  A 30-40 goal season could give Aguero greater aspirations if City can’t find its way deeper in the Champions League. 

&amp;nbsp;

###**Overall:**
8.5/10

&amp;nbsp;

How much effort would it take to just build a website that offers entry level positions for people wanting to get off the dole.

take all the complaints from universal jobmatch (pyramid schemes, not real jobs, not updated often enough, salary too low to raise out of poverty, interview too far away), enforce a strict sorting and filing system so that even with the most basic job description, it finds its way into the hands of those who need it. Do everything to make sure the employer and employee meet as soon as possible so that competition

maybe, if it goes alright, set up a pay per cv system for recent graduates. 

The only crux as far as I can see is getting the information directly from employees and making sure there are no middlemen and all the businesses are verified.

No direct article to link to, but on todays You and Yours it was discussed how a few people have been denied mortgages since the new affordability tests since they came in a few years ago. It seems that pensions are being counted so if you pay into a pension pot - you basically have to choose between having a house or having a pension. 

Now, this seems sensible enough on the face of affordability - but in terms of long term stability if this is the case for many people (only a few have noticed as it's hit applications on the cross over) - and for one I'm concerned for the younger generations who are buying houses. 

There's likely to be a pension crisis anyway and this seems like another  nail in the coffin to ensuring it happens - especially for the young who will have little choice in the matter.

Watch out for the Match Thread in /r/soccer, it's predictably a toxic environment right now - top comment is 'Fuck QPR'. Class.

**Match Updates: (will update when possible)**

0' Kick-off at Wembley. Come on you R's!!!

4' Free kick in dangerous place for Derby...

5' Straight into the wall.

6' Corner to Rangers.

8' Long-range effort goes wide from Austin.

15' Good free-kick opportunity here for QPR...

16' ...into the wall.

18' Lots of QPR long-range shots going nowhere at the moment. Derby 55% possession so far.

25' Corner for Derby produces nothing much. Derby have had more of the game so far.

28' Penalty shout for Derby. Looks like a dive after replays, 

33' Kranjcar goes off injured for Traore. Watching this right now is nervewracking, can't imagine what it's like being there. Derby having all the pressure, and when they attack it's with rapid pace. However neither team has created any clear-cut opportunities yet. Hoilett with a good run into the area loses the ball.

41' Great save from Rob Green from an in-swinging free kick that could have gone in had he not been so alert.

44' Traore makes a decent run after a great bit of work from Clint Hill, but his shot is way off-target.

45' Half-time and it's **0-0**. Cagey.

***

46' Back out then for the second half. Come on Rangers!

55' Lots of Derby pressure, corners and crosses. Bobby is preparing to come on.

57' Charlie Austin misses a cracking chance from about seven / eight yards out. Agonizingly close. Bobby now on for Doyle. Best chance of the tie goes begging.

60' O'Neil sent off for a challenge just outside the box. Straight red. In my opinion he was not the last man, Hill was, but we all know what Lee Mason's like. It'll be a shame if it comes down to a poor refereeing decision.

Derby had huge amounts of pressure for the whole game, and unbelievably Zamora snatched it with our only shot on target in injury time. These are the moments that make life worth living. Premier League again next year, hopefully we'll do a hell of a better job than we did last time. And make sure /r/soccer knows about it.

Just incredible. Derby were pressing so so hard, then away broke Hoilett and after Derby had a few great chances to clear it, he kept fighting, won the ball and crossed it where it found Bobby who curled it around the keeper into the top-left corner. Truly unbelievable.

It seems to me like their increased TV coverage was a significant factor in the massive swing towards UKIP in Thursdays local elections (And as we'll likely see on Sunday, the European elections too). This is because voters who traditionally support one of the major parties found through the increased media exposure, that they actually agree with UKIP on a lot of issues. I'm sure that given the same opportunity for exposure, the Greens (Or any other party for that matter) would gain a significant number of votes too.

If UKIP carry their 'major party' media status in the next general election, they have a real chance of gaining seats even with the FPTP system, but the Greens don't stand a chance outside of their home constituency because they don't have any coverage or exposure in the media. This means that many people who do support them ~~think~~ know they're a wasted vote in a flawed FPTP system.

In September I will be starting a graduate job and can apply for a £7000 interest free loan via Santander. I get the option of 12, 24, 36, or 48 month repayment plans.

I will come into the job with savings of approx £15k, and an interest free overdraft from university, likely close to it's maximum of £1000 after having to finance a summer without a job, and also a deposit on a place in London, plus all related moving expenses.

The 15k is in a Nationwide ISA, currently earning 2.25%. I was planning  a revamp of my personal finances this summer and moving that into a better account if it is available.

I'm trying to work out what the best method of utilizing this loan would be, or whether it would be better not to at all.

My intial idea was to whack it all into an ISA (possibly stocks/shares) and pay off the interest out of my salary each month, effectively using it as a form of saving, but getting the benefit of interest on the lump sum from the start as opposed to the however much it is per month. Due to the cost of living in London, I would likely take the longest, 4 year repayment period and be repaying approx £145 a month, which is likely affordable for me, although I'm not 100% sure until I am living there. 

My other option is to not take the loan, and pay the money into a pension pre tax, which, due to the before tax deduction, end up being more money. I am hesitant to do this as the company only matches pension funding up to 2%, and an overall concern of whether a pension is a great idea. I appreciate that I need to save for older age, but it still seems somewhat... wrong to lock up the money I have until I am 55+. My mother is a landlord and property is thus appealing instead of a pension, but I am very much swayable on this.

TLDR
Age 22

Starting job in London on wage of circa £28k

£15k in 2.25% ISA

Approx £1000 overdraft interest free.

Graduate loan offered of £7k with 1, 2, 3 or 4 year repayment terms, all at 0% fixed via Santander.

Can afford to take it and pay the repayments whilst saving the 7k long term; should I? Or should I contribute to pension?

Was it a lack of quality in our defensive players? We all know that the form of Glen Johnson was a disappointment but the defense consisted of much more than just him. Martin Skrtel netted a few own-goals and seemed to make a few failures that led to conceding a goal, not good. Daniel Agger, we didn't see much of him but he seemed shaky in games like vs. Cardiff away, not good. Mamadou Sakho, quality centre back but is very young and lacks experience, don't remember any expensive mistakes, but I cringed a lot while he was playing, not good. Jon Flanagan, great tackler and we saw a lot of his strong sides in the season, but then when we saw statistics it turned out no one has been dribbled past as much as him in the league, not good. Aly Cissokho, weeeeell, don't know what to say about him. Kolo Touré, 2 expensive mistakes but still won after his own-goal vs. Fulham but still lost a goal and then two points after his assist for WBA to redeem the equalizer, not good. Now what is the real problem, all of our defenders seemed to have very big weak sides, but we don't know why. Now, should we renew the defensive roster or should we take in new defensive coaches? When we look back to the 2008-09 season, we only conceded 27 goals in the league, and the man behind the scenes back then was Mauricio Pellegrino I think, now he is the head coach of Estudiantes, a club in a relegation battle in the Argentinian league, do we want that lad back to show our defenders how to do it or should we hire Jamie Carragher to do the job. If the problem is not the staff, but the players, how could we change the defensive roster, who should go out and who should we bring in? I think Enrique can do a good job in the first team next season, but I don't know about the other 3.

This is another one of the word-limit-pushing submissions I have written on this sub. This will focus on the young players at the club, and what Liverpool could and/or should be trying to do with/for them. This is generally conjecture or my opinion.

This will be the 1st part, about the senior squad defenders. Next will be midfielders and attackers, followed by the youth prospects at the club.

##Players

This is going to be split into the current squad status of the player, and then by their position.

##First Team

In the first team squad, the following players either have been on loan at some point in the last season, or it appears they could benefit from a loan move:

**CB: [16. Sebastian Coates](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Sebastian_Coates)**

* Had a challenging last season, suffering a season ending injury before preseason.
* Went on loan to [Nacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Nacional_de_Football) in his home country of Uruguay in January to help his recovery
* Good technical player, but needs to learn to utilise his height and size more effectively.

*Verdict: To me, seems that he would benefit from 38 games in the Premier League on loan. If after playing week in week out he still doesn't meet the standards of the club, then offload him.*

*Dream - Loan to Stoke*

**CB: [26. Tiago Ilori](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Tiago_Ilori)**

* Arrived last summer from [Sporting Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Clube_de_Portugal) for £7 Million
* Moved to [Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_CF) in January after failing to make a first team appearance for the club.
* [Rodgers mentions his reasoning behind Ilori's loan are development and adapting](http://www.insidefutbol.com/2013/12/04/liverpool-boss-brendan-rodgers-confirms-tiago-ilori-loan-intention/111491/)
* Looks to be a great defender, with strength and vision beyond his years.
* Needs to get game time in order to continue developing.

*Verdict: With Liverpool linked with 2 more Centre-half signings this summer ([Dejan Lovren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejan_Lovren), [Rumour](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-transfer-rumours-reds-8million-3579551) &amp; [Steven Caulker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Caulker), [Rumour](http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/307061.html) + [Comparison of the 2 and Martin Skrtel](http://www.thisisanfield.com/2014/05/skrtel-vs-caulker-vs-lovren-complete-defender/)) it seems the club will be full on their stocks. Ilori will struggle to get gametime if he remains at Liverpool, so a loan move away to a Premier League team would be highly beneficial to his development. He would learn the English game, as well as adapting to the physical nature of the Premier League, while hopefully playing for a team with a similar passing philosophy.*

*Dream - Loan to Southampton in deal for Lovren*

**RB/CB: [34. Martin Kelly](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Martin_Kelly)**

* Kelly is a youth product of Merseyside, beginning his career as a right back, but always intending to become a centre-half once he matured.
* He has had his oppurtunities limited at the club. After seemingly being Rodgers preference to [Jose Enrique](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Jose_Enrique) at the start of the 2012/13 season when [Glen Johnson](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Glen_Johnson) was played on the left, he suffered a season ending ACL injury.
* He has been severely injury prone, and that injury suffered against [Manchester City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.) in a [2-2 draw at Anfield](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19310450) has been hugely detrimental to his development.
* Possesses the traits desired in a high-level defender, but needs to improve his range of passing and defensive headers.

*Verdict: While Kelly has suffered a lack of game time at the club, a return to the first team squad, as well as participation in both Domestic and Continental Cup competitions should see him find some match fitness.*

*Dream - Stays until January and plays in the Cups and the occasional league game while we rest players for Europe. Goes on loan in January to play the second half of the season week in week out. Half Season Loan to Sunderland*

**RB/CB: [47. Andre Wisdom](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Andre_Wisdom)**

* Came in to replace Kelly in 2012/13 at right back
* Showed promise and potential while still very young
* Went on loan to [Derby County](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEQQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDerby_County_F.C.&amp;ei=Zcx_U_eGO8fSkgWD6IC4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEP7f7_ZTBeNcgDJgvrdywxe91tQ&amp;sig2=aZPf4kWzzS00DSgG5tKQUA&amp;bvm=bv.67720277,d.dGI) last season, playing predominantly at right back.
* Seems to be on the same trajectory as Kelly, developing as a defender at right back before shifting to the centre.
* Strong and fast but needs to work on his passing and delivery to the box.

*Verdict: Will struggle to get games now he seems to be behind 3 players for the right back spot. Another loan seems likely, probably back to Derby if they get promoted.*

*Dream - Loan to Derby in deal for [Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hughes)*
 
**LB: [49. Jack Robinson](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Robinson)**

* Looked very promising at The Academy a few years ago, but seems to have dropped off.
* Spent the last half of 2012/13 at [Wolverhampton Wanderers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.) and the whole of last season at [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool_F.C.)
* Fast and good deliveries for his forwards, but he lacks the power of other Left Back prodigies in the club or country.
* Defensively he has been exposed at times, and can also be a bit brash.

*Verdict: Won't get a game at Liverpool next season, with a new Left Back joining Enrique to strengthen the squads depth. Another loan looks likely, and again a Premier League side would be ideal.*

*Dream - Loan to West Ham/Aston Villa*

I've been knocked off again. 

Heading round the North Circ to Kilburn, came off and went through Neasden 'cause the traffic was pants on the circ,  to get the bike MOT'd at Southern Cross, and I'm filtering, roughly 15mph. There's a bus at a bus stop on the right side of the road, so I figured it's ok to filter with no-oncoming traffic; As I got to the gap with the bus and my lane, someone drove at me head on from a side road. I grabbed my front brake, endo'd the bike, landed on their bonnet with the bike pinning my legs down. 

The driver gave the excuse that the person in stationary traffic flashed them that it was ok to come out. 

Apparently there was damage to their car, caused by me, and potentially their bike. Police attended, Ambulance took me off, had some pretty bad pain in my knees. Hospital said my knee's were fine though. 

Ended up paying £20 for a cab ride back to the bike, then rode it 20 miles home. The rear panel is seriously messed up, cracked and everything else. clutch perch seems to be broken too. 

Not sure what's next, who's fault it is, and if I'll be able to afford a bike any time in the near future (If I have a claim against me)

The woman said she was sorry, etc, it was a freak accident, all that. Surely saying sorry all the time is an admission of guilt? 

Does anyone know what I should be doing right now? Never had an accident involving another vehicle.

Where does one get such data?

We have some primary focuses for this year which include sexual orientation and mental health in the workplace (I work for a mental health trust) but we are also trying to ensure that we adhere to the nine [protected characterists](http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/community-and-living/equality-and-diversity/the-nine-protected-characteristics/).

Like, the Doctor decides to kill them via ice pool, and a patrol gets there, and then the Doctor just *pushes the shit* out of one of them, and one of the Thal's pushes him too but he gets knocked out by a goddamn eyestalk strike, but really the Dalek is somehow entirely defenseless, and all he does is say ""ASSIST"" really high-pitched like. It's just like, c'mon son, they become these goofy mooks who are entirely unaware of people snooping around behind them, who don't have a fast enough reaction time to shoot elevator doors down, and who can be stopped by getting pushed a lot.


Another thing I noticed and loved were the little bits of character. Like when that Spirodon is in the Dalek's base, saying that he has to talk to the section leader, and the Dalek talking to him is all ""NO THE SECTION LEADER'S DOING STUFF"" and then upon being told that it was vital he goes ""....OKAY"", trusting him for absolutely no reason. And then, when the Spirodon goes to hang out in the lab, these two scientist Daleks are discussing vaccination procedures for them, and one says that he'll assist the other in something and starts to move, but his gun bangs into the glass case containing the vaccine, and the other just really apprehensively goes ""CAUTION, **CAUTION**"" oh man it's so great

I can also see an agreement between the two to give Jose a long spell regardless of what happens in the first couple of seasons.

So The Doctor chooses his name.

In the good man goes to war River says we got the word from you, Doctor is healer in everything blah blah translation circuit would make the meaning the same where ever he spoke his self-given title. 

Choosing the Doctor as a name MADE the Doctor the name to be chosen cause hes a time traveler. If he was as amazing but named Dinglebut, Dinglebut would replace the word Doctor. 

""I choose to be The Doctor cause Im a healer and will always help ect. ect.""

He is destined to full fill his promise because they travel through time and affecting language itself everywhere, that special promise is actually the creation of the word. 

So intense ritual Timelord stuff. Creating Paradoxes. 

If you fullfill the promise you know your REAL name, cause it would be a Paradox, where did the word come from? So if the promise is met it would come from you. Doctor is the name the Universe chose for him. USING TIME TRAVEL LIKE A BOSS.

Main questions are:

* How long do you think it will be before you can buy?
* If you are buying  - how long as it taken you?
* Where is the best place in the country to buy (a bit unrelated)

For me to buy in Brighton at least, I can't see it happening in under 10-15 years even if everything goes well. We could buy outside of here but even then I can't imagine it being that much quicker. 

In terms of best to buy I'm thinking in terms of good quality of life, but not yet hit that boom of people flooding in.

They twice as many followers than a racist grouping (BNP) and even a currently popular party that deals in populism (UKIP).

##**Comments from Reddit:**

“I don't hate him, but it's ridiculous that he starts so much; what more does he have to do? score an own goal hat trick? give away a penalty in every match?”

“Never lose faith in the ponytail is what I learned this season.”

“Fuck Demichelis”

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Review:**

Demichelis didn’t get the start he would have hoped for upon his arrival at Manchester City, injuring himself in his very first training session, and giving Pellegrini something of a defensive nightmare with Kompany also out injured.

Upon his return from injury Demichelis found himself part of a backline that had found no consistency, either in personnel or performance, and struggling to cope with the higher line and more adventurous midfield than they were used to.  Systematic problems and occasional individual errors gave fans and journalists an easy scapegoat for City’s frailties at the back, and Demichelis quickly became a figure of ridicule.

While others mocked, City’s defensive organisation improved and Demichelis continued to put in commanding performances, and slowly but surely reminded people why his CV was so impressive to begin with.

Grudging acceptance of his abilities eventually turned to legitimate praise, earning him Player of the Month for April.  The turning point, perhaps, came a little earlier in mid-March, away to Hull City.  Vincent Kompany was given an early bath, and City were left with a defensive pairing of the club’s two biggest figures of ridicule - Martin Demichelis, and an out-of-position Javi Garcia.  The two “calamitous” defenders combined to deliver a genuine offside trap masterclass, held a high defensive line excellently, and Demichelis in particular showcased his ability to launch attacks from deep in his own half.

After a great deal of unwarranted criticism, Demichelis finally won over his doubters, won the Barclays Premier League, and played his way back into contention for one of the strongest national squads in world football.

Not bad.

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Summer plans:**

Off the back of a very strong season, Demichelis has found himself in the 30-man provisional Argentina squad after a two-year absence.  If he impresses in training, Demichelis could find himself among the favourites to lift the most coveted prize in all of football - if not in all of sport - the World Cup.  If Demichelis can steady the back-line for his national team, their attacking prowess means there’s no limit to how far they could go this summer.

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Expectations for next year:**

Demichelis doesn’t appear to be going anywhere but will almost certainly find himself with stronger competition for his starting spot in City’s defence.  He will likely find himself as a back-up for (rather than a partner to) Vincent Kompany, but has shown he is capable of leading from the back in the captain’s absence.

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Overall:**

7.5

The reaction, therefore, for many is to vote UKIP (because of the 'out the EU' pledge) or even in some cases voting Britain First or BNP. There's obviously a lot of anger out there - it seems similar to the reaction to the immigrants from Pakistan and India in the 70s and 80s and the rise of the National Front (ie. 'things going bad? One change I can see is more foreign people, that must be the reason!'). 

For example, I see people on my Facebook page, people I went to school with, ranting anti-immigrant statuses and happy with the rise of UKIP. I don't think they're racist, neccassarily, but seem scared and don't like perceived change. For instance, someone may respond to a status with undisputed facts and the reply to that will be 'I disagree'.  

I don't really have a stand with this issue personally (I think it's inevitable the world becomes more international; plus I don't like the anti-EU stance because of the millions from the UK who live in other parts of Europe, and I'd quite like to live in a few European places someday too), but I do think some changes need to be made to curb the anger.

Therefore, what can be done? The anger and fear about immigration is not going away, and the media certainly isn't helping with the education side of the issue. There probably isn't an answer or a solution, but the resentment and bubbling anger against immigrants in my area is worrying to see, as many I see doing it I don't think are, or were, angry or racist people.

Is it about education? If so, how to approach it?
What changes to immigration should be undertaken? Does UKIP have a point?
How do you tackle those areas with large percentages of people who are now against immigrants and the EU?

A lot of people seem to be asking about stacks for the ESL cup and quite a few new people coming to the sub Reddit since the post the other day hit front page of /r/dota2.

[ESL Cup Hub](http://www.esl.eu/uk/dota2/dota2challenge2/) - We now have 5 weeks left of this series, and sign ups are open until seedings go live on the night of the cup.

I've made this thread as a central location for people that want to play in this cup series for fun in a stack, or find new people to play with for this series.

For simplicity, I would recommend posting a bit about yourself for people so people get an idea for what skill you are, what you like to play etc. 


For me this would be -

Player - Holy Cupcake

Steam - http://steamcommunity.com/id/holycupcake

Dotabuff - http://dotabuff.com/players/33218747

MMR - 3.2k, so about the same as Sproink.

Position - 4/5

Also, I know dipbrow a) is expensive, b) is always out of stock ([I got mine here](http://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/)) and c) dries almost INSTANTLY so if you're wanting something different I can recommend the Rimmel eyebrow pencil, with a spoolie on the end as a bonus, and the HD brow palette in Foxy which has a powder in a shade almost identical to Auburn as well as an ash brown, a blonde and a black.

I just finished one of my business studies exam, and dispite trying, I'm afraid that I didn't do well. I want to get an 'A' in the exam, but I worry that I got a 'B' in this one, and I got a 'B' in the controlled assessment. I'm not sure that much less than a high 'A*' in the final exam will bring the final grade to an 'A'. I am concerned, because I fear that I won't be able to enter Cambridge to do business there if I don't get the marks I need. 

My course is split like this: 

* Unit 1: Setting up a Business (40%) - done 
* Unit 2: Growing as a Business (35%) - will do 
* Unit 3: Investigating a business (25%) - done 

In unit 3 I believe I was only a mark from an 'A'. 

Around how many marks are likely to be needed to get an 'A' in the unit 1 + 2 papers?
 
How many marks do I need in total to get an 'A'? 

Will I be able to re-sit unit 1+2? I realize that I can't resit the controlled assessment.

Here it is!

---

9 years ago Liverpool took the trip to Istanbul to face AC Milan in the Champions League final. AC Milan were clear favourites to win the match, and rightly so, their side was way better than Liverpool's.

When the match started, Djimi Traore gave Milan a free kick on the right wing. The free kick was whipped in and Paolo Maldini gave them the lead inside a minute. Things didn't get better for Liverpool, as Harry Kewell had to go off injured after about 15 minutes, Vladimir Smicer came on for him. Shortly after that, Liverpool felt they deserved a penalty, but didn't get one, and Crespo scored on the counter. Crespo scored again a couple of minutes later to make it 3-0.

Milan fans were celebrating. Scousers were crying. Everybody thought it was over. But it wasn't. Second half started. Then came the six minutes that would change Liverpool's history forever.

Riise crossed in. Who else but Steven Gerrard leaped up and scored a beautiful header. Hope shot into every single Liverpool fans hearts. 2 minutes later, Smicer found himself in some space, and fancied a shot, and it went in. 3-2. The hope had changed into belief. 2 minutes later, Gerrard was through on goal, and about to make it 3-3, but Gattuso fouled him. Penalty awarded.

This was the moment. Xabi Alonso stepped up to take the penalty. He shoots into the bottom left corner. Dida saves. But Alonso followed it up. 3-3. The most amazing comeback in European football history was complete.

The city of Milan was shell shocked. The city of Liverpool was going mental. Liverpool had taken the game from the jaws of defeat, and managed to equalize. Now came the hard part. The whole team was exhausted, and they had to defend for their lives. Luckily, the Liverpool goalkeeper had the game of his life, making arguably one of the best saves of all time when there were 3 minutes left of extra time. After extra time, it was time for the dreaded penalty shootout.

Milan took the first penalty. Serginho stepped up, one of the best penalty takers in the world, and he fired it miles over the bar.

Hamann took the next penalty. Scored.

Pirlo took the next one. Saved by Dudek. 

Cissé took the next one. Scored.

Jon Dahl Tomasson took the next one. Scored.

Riise took the next one. Saved by Dida.

Smicer took the next one. Scored. Match point, Liverpool.

Shevchenko walked up to take potentially the last penalty of the game. Ran up to the ball. Dudek saved. Liverpool had completed the best comeback in the history of European Football.

Liverpool had won the Champions League.

I was confused though by the online store because it asked for a start date on my Visa card. I can't seem to find any info regarding how to find the start date and I want to make sure I snatch up a kit before they are all sold. Is there a way to go about doing it without calling my bank since it won't be open until Tuesday? Have any other US supporters had this same problem? I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post on for this. Just figured maybe some other US Spurs supporters had the same issue.

Update: Just used a friends card to get my jersey ordered!! First jersey for me and I'm looking forward to possibly more. Thanks for the help everyone.

I've been searching for the right sub to post this to, and this seemed like the best choice. I'm British and was born and raised in the UK, but I never actually went to secondary school. The reason for this was that my mother was overly protective of me, to a somewhat extreme degree. She seemed to have a particular, negative view about state schools. She thought I would be getting beaten up every day by other boys and wouldn't be able to cope. I got homeschooled from 11-16. Also, I don't want this to be an IAmA as I rarely discuss this with anyone and don't feel comfortable doing so. Here are my questions anyway.

When you went to secondary, was there a lot of violence or fighting between the boys? If fights broke out, did they typically get broken up quite quickly? Was it an everyday thing? I guess I'm trying to figure out whether my mum's fears were anything close to the reality. I suspect they weren't, but I'd like to hear from people who actually went. 

Are state schools generally ""rougher"" than private schools, or is that not the case? By rougher, I mean is the kids' behavior usually worse, is there more violence, is the teaching generally worse in state schools compared to private? What was your experience like? I would have been in a state school if I'd actually went. My mum wanted to get me into a private school but couldn't afford it.

How important of a phase in your life was secondary school for you? Do you remember it fondly? Do you feel it played an important role in shaping the man or woman you are today? That's all I can think of.

If you don't know anything about Russian people maybe you can watch Russian news or film or read an article or ask your friends or anything to get some information and then decide for yourself if it's false or seems like truth.

I am here, because I want opinions of real people not just shit from mass media or politicians.

I want to know what British people think of Russian people. And yes, for sure we can't avoid stereotypes but they are necessary too to analyze and cure them.

Anyway, please, answer this questionnaire if it's not too difficult for you.I would be very grateful if you did it!You would help me to do well my project and pass the subject.

I'm genuinely stunned that anyone can spend $1000 a month on food for one person, let alone that this seems to be a regular thing for so many people.

I appreciate that yes costs are higher in the US and yes wages are higher, but that does seem to be an absolutely astronomical amount of money to spend on something that you're only going to flush down the toilet at the end of the day.

Here's why its metaphorical:

1) Suarez brilliance - Thats the first thing that comes to our mind. Without Luis Suarez's absolute brilliance this season, we wouldn't have been where we ended.

2) The Gerrard cross - Another reason: Classic assists and set pieces by our El Captino. Great free kicks, crosses and penalties. 

3) The long shot - Just like Suarez's amazing shot, finishing second was a long shot. And a crazy long shot at that. 

4) So close, yet so far - The beautiful shot, and missed by a few inches. Just like this season, so close yet so far.

5) Everything went right - Everything was absolutely perfect with Suarez's shot, apart of course from the final result. Sound familiar?

6) Utter and total dominance - Thats what comes to mind. The way we dominated other teams. Just steam rolled so many of them, a lot like this game.

7) Kolo Toure's miss- Suarez showed brilliance and was so incredibly amazing in creating that chance, and Kolo messed up. Now replace Suarez with ""Liverpool's attack"" and Kolo with ""Liverpool's defence"".

8) A little more of a normal one - We hit the most 20 times, the most by any PL team. 

9) And finally, just like this season, this attempt left us speechless. It was enjoyable but it will leave us saying, ""If only it went in"".

Hello r/Cambridge! I'm writing out of **desperation** as I need to move to your beautiful town in a week to start a job and haven't had any luck finding a place! It's been so difficult because I live in Edinburgh at the moment and haven't been able to afford to come through Cambridge to view rooms.

My name is Chris, I'm a 23 year old guy currently living in Edinburgh. I'm quiet, very tidy to live with and generally laid back. I am looking for a place to stay from 1st June to 31st of August in Cambridge as I will be working with Cambridge University Press through the summer. 

I'm just finishing up my Masters in Publishing and will be writing my dissertation through the summer. 

I can provide references from previous flatmates/letting agents if you would like them. 

I need to move in on the 1st of June. 

Ideally rent will be in the region of £400-£460 per month with bills included. (I'm happy to be flexible on price for the right place). /copypasta

So, if any of you have a room for rent or know anyone who does and could put me in touch with them I'd be forever grateful as it's coming to crunch time.

p.s. sorry for the wall of text :)

Explanation: I was watching a short documentary series on the BBC iPlayer a few days ago called ""Nairn Across Britain"" where a chap travels across the country via road, canal and railway in 1972. In the 2nd episode he ends up at Leeds and I was just amazed how simple Leeds looked back in the early 70s! Atleast from the canal areas.   
So I wanted to figure out where he ended up, I found some points of reference in the 2nd image, namely the white and brown building and figured out where he was standing by finding them on Google Earth. I gotta say, I'm just blown away how much it's changed!  

What I found interesting was how the presenter in the documentary laments the fact at how there is little development in Leeds, especially the canals which would make great place for buildings and now today the canals have tons of developments that run along side it.",false,yorkshire,t5_2rz9n,null,null,self,Leeds in 1972 vs today,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/yorkshire/comments/26fvst/leeds_in_1972_vs_today/

Well, [the survey is out](http://www.begbies-traynorgroup.com/Libraries/Documents/Football_Insolvency_Survey_2014_-_Scotland.sflb.ashx) (warning: PDF).

So, what does it say

It's worth pointing out that there are, for some reason, only 32 clubs involved in this survey.

3 clubs are in critical financial distress.  This is down from when the last survey was done by 1 (rumoured to be Killmarnock).  One of these clubs will be Rangers, with their financial troubles well known and discussed.  Depending on when the survey was conducted, another is likely to be Hearts.  However, they are now out of administration with a solid plan for recovery.  No idea who the third club could be.  This is also the lowest number in 2 years.

16 clubs show signs of early financial distress.  This is described as less serious.  Obviously, this isn't ideal, but they don't show any comparison to the last one, so no idea if this is an upward or downward trend.

Now, attendance.  It's oft repeated on here that all attendances are down across the board.  And a look at the statistics over the SPFL as a whole, down 6% on the last survey, would seem to back that up.  However, look at a league by league breakdown.  The SPL is up 3% from six months ago.  This fits in with what has been widely reported over the season.  The 1st division is down 8%, which is somewhat of a surprise.  Division 2 is down a massive 16%.  This puts the lie to the much repeated claim that Rangers attract fans.  It's also worth pointing out that this is still the second highest attendance numbers since 2012.  Division 3 has risen 1%

So, what of the future?  I have to warn you, this is pure speculation on my part.  Rangers, I don't know.  I actually do think that unless something is done, and soon, they will at the very least go back into administration.  If Hearts stick to their plan and don't go mad, they will be fine.

The 16 clubs, no idea what could be causing their problems, but it could be something as simple as low attendance or something more serious.

Attendances?  I can't see the SPL dropping.  I keep saying because it's true, outside Celtic and Hearts, the SPL was more competitive this year than I've seen in a good while.  With proper relegation and clubs making noises about actually competing with Celtic rather than settling for best of the rest, I can't see that changing.  I'd expect attendances to at least stay the same.

Division 1 is where it'll be next year.  Ranger, Hearts, either Hibs or Hamilton and some possible surprise teams, I can't see attendances going any other direction than up.

Division 2 will probably increase as well.  I get the feeling there was somewhat of an air of inevitability about just about every position last season.  With that gone, it should rise.

Division 3 will probably increase as well.  Finishing last doesn't just mean being the worst team in league football, it could mean an end to league football for the club.  The play off is widely credited (rightly, even if they messed up the structure) with making the bottom half of the SPL exciting last season and the same will likely happen in Division 3.

Feel free to come back and laugh if/when I'm proven horribly wrong.

Been reading up on PF for a while and still have some questions left over.  


My background:

24, live in house with my girlfriend, both employed @ around £22k a year.

I started looking into PF earlier in the year and got as far as maxing out my cash ISA before the end of the last tax year, but haven't made any other moves because I'm still confused, so here goes:  



**ISA's being tax free:**
&gt; * If you only get the interest on your ISA tax free, and the ISA interest rate is low (e.g. mine is 1%), but inflation is 2.5%, aren't you losing money?

&gt; * Why would you use an ISA at such a low rate?



**Vanguard LifeStrategy account:**
&gt; * After reading about various investments and different types, I settled on tracker funds being right for me.   

&gt; * A name that I've seen a lot is the Vanguard LifeStrategy funds, so Looked into them. However, they're only at 1.3/1.4% growth (below inflation?) http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/v/vanguard-lifestrategy-40-equity-accumulation  

&gt; * Why are these so regularly recommended if the returns are so low? (e.g. compare them with another one I found, the HSBC FTSE 250 Index - http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/h/hsbc-ftse-250-index-class-c-accumulation )  


**Why are things so bad this year?**
&gt; * Looking in other places, and recently here - http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/index-tracker-funds/view-index-tracker-funds - 
&gt; * Things for 13/14 seem to be so much worse than previous years. The HSBC FTSE 250 I linked earlier is a good example of this, 42% last year, down to 10% this year.  

**General Points / Questions**
&gt; *My general plan now is:*

&gt; * Emergency fund of 6 months expenses into ISA (still unsure about ISA's with rates so low?)

&gt; * A percentage of the rest of my disposable income into tracker funds (around 30%), but unsure what funds

&gt; * I loved the ideas behind this article - http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/ - And am interested in compound interest, I think this means that I want to go for **accumulation** *not* **income** tracker funds, is this correct?

&gt; * Getting decent returns (ho ho ho, I know everyone wants this), what I mean is real returns that are above inflation.

&amp;nbsp;

##**Comments from Reddit:**
“No chance. I'm better than Lescott for the past 18 months and I'm a crap defender.”  -- /u/devineman

“Lescott has always been a work horse. He may do wrong by us but at the end he's always the fastest one back. Almost blew the league in '12 but impressed me tonight.”


&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Review:**
Can you believe that Lescott didn’t pick up a red or yellow card all season? That about sums it up. Lescott’s performances were largely bend-but-not-break performances this season. He was at fault for a few goals early in the season, as he seemed to struggle with the change in set piece marking and Manuel Pellegrini’s high back line. In the losses at both Cardiff and Sunderland, it seemed as though he was playing with one leg and half a brain, often finding himself largely out of position. It’s likely that Pellegrini took these performances harshly, and set Lescott out for the rest of the season. Though he did appear enough for a Premier League medal, he rarely made a difference for City. Lescott looked terribly slow and inept at handling the Barcelona attack in the knockout rounds of the champions league, but  did earn a MOTM performance in the FA Cup against Blackburn Rovers. That about says it all, doesn’t it? 

It has become clearer and clearer that he’s just a step too slow and a step too late to respond, and isn’t at the high level he was two years ago. There’s no doubt that Lescott can do a job, but much like Adam Johnson was in years past, the player is not at the level City are now. While guys like Javi Garcia, Martin Demichelis, and Aleks Kolarov upped their game to prove they were ready, Lescott’s game declined and ultimately has indicated his way out of the squad.

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Summer plans:**

When one doesn’t play very much, it can’t be expected that he’ll make an impression on his national team’s manager. Lescott may have entered the season with a very outside chance of getting in the England squad, but his lack of playing time set him on the out. The versatility of guys like Glen Johnson and Chris Smalling combined with Phil Jagielka getting back from injury meant Lescott would miss out this summer. His international days are effectively finished, but Lescott can enjoy the plethora of teams bidding for his services this summer instead. 

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Expectations for next year:**
I hope I speak for all when I say, “Thank you, Joleon.” Lescott’s performances two years ago are a large part of City’s growth, as he was one of the first talented defenders City bought under new ownership. He has never caused a stir despite being left out of the squad many a time, and has been a bright face to see at Carrington. Lescott was nothing but a true professional and that’s what his new club will be receiving.

He has confirmed himself he’ll be moving on and who really knows where he’ll end up. Teams like Aston Villa and West Ham have been known to be eyeing his services, but Europe has made moves as well; Besiktas from Turkey have been tracking the defender for a long time. Wherever he ends up, we can all hope he’ll receive the applause he deserves when he returns back to the Etihad. “Joleon Lescott, he’s top of the league.” 

&amp;nbsp;
    
###**Overall:**

4.5

&amp;nbsp;
________________

Any last words for Joleon? Does anyone think he still could do a job for City? Where would you like to seem him playing next year?

* I would pump money into a new schooling type system like the Academies in England for schools with Secondary school status that would be considered to have poor academic results.

* A new Cross community schooling scheme where predominately Catholic schools and Protestant schools can combine in certain aspects of education i.e. joint projects/sporting/learning about each other's culture.

* Massive funding for ICT education in aspects like coding and software design in Working class areas

* Social housing schemes designed to give N.I. residents first preference over foreign immigrants 

* Employ local builders/workers/trade to help in social housing projects/ tradesmen and women coming out of BMC.

* Allow the selling and distribution of marijuana which will be taxed and money earned will be pumped back into the economy

* Better traffic mechanisms for Belfast/More Park and rides

* Make the M1 an autobahn i.e. a recommended speed limit on some parts (go as fast as you want) 

* Let bars and clubs open / distribute alcohol to whatever time they want 

* Ban all flags placed on council property i.e. lampposts and charge people caught putting them up

* Legalize selling of safe legal highs just like New Zealand and earn tax from that

In fact, it is pretty much exactly as popular, if not even more as/than RTD's. This is something everyone should know by now. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't. Moffat gets called ""the most divisive producer since JNT"", ""everybody knows Doctor Who went to shit"" or unpopular opinion memes are used to declare ""I like Steven Moffat"". 

This post intends to do one thing and one thing only: 
1. Prove that Steven Moffat's Doctor Who is very popular indeed, at least as popular as RTD's was, so one may link to it if necessary.

It's not subject for discussion whether YOU like Moffat. If you don't like him, I don't have have anything against that. Go insult his writing style, go write pamphlets against him, go get a ""Moffat hate"" tattoo if you want to. That's all perfectly fine, you're entitled to your opinion. But don't go parading around and act like everyone shares this opinion.

Los geht's!

- The [series trendline which indicates the development of IMDb scores over time for New Who](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0436992) is almost completely flat, rising just a little bit from 8.1 to 8.2.

- Eight out of the [Top 10 NewWho episodes on IMDb](http://i.imgur.com/iCb9Nuk.png) have been written by Steven Moffat and five are from his era.

- According to [the readers of Doctor Who Magazine](http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-top-stories-doctors-according-to-dwm-2014-63506.htm), The Day of the Doctor is the best Doctor Who story of all time. Moffat has three stories in the top 10 in total and shares this honour with Robert Holmes (although the Moff's episodes are ranked higher).

- When DoctorWhoTV did a [series 1-7 face-off survey](http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/series-1-7-face-off-results-everything-else-episodes-9-13-specials-62691.htm), episodes from the Davies and Moffat eras had almost the same average percentages. (RTD 14%, Moffat 14.67%)

- When they did a [similar experiment using the official BBC AI scores](http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/settling-the-moffat-vs-rtd-debate-using-ai-scores-63151.htm), the outcome was almost identical. (RTD 85.57%, Moffat 86%)

- In the top 10 of the [2013 Ultimate Doctor Who Story Poll by DoctorWhoTV](http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-ultimate-doctor-who-story-your-top-50-20-1-56034.htm), five stories stemmed from each the Davies and the Moffat era and six stories were written by Moffat himself (and this was before The Day of the Doctor).

- The [Top 30/244 Doctor Who stories ever on Doctor Who Dynamic Rankings](http://i.imgur.com/3ZPiq7Q.png) include eight stories from Moffat’s era and nine stories that were written by him.
 
- According to the Dynamic Rankings on GallifreyBase (which is a rather Classic Who-centric forum, as made evident by the results), Steven Moffat [as a producer](http://i.imgur.com/Xe3flKO.png) is pretty much exactly as middle-of-the-road as Russell T Davies, but he is the [7th/31 most popular writer](http://i.imgur.com/Zoeiv3l.png). I should mention though that these numbers don’t include the massively popular anniversary year, because the 2014 rankings are ongoing at the moment.

- In the [Greatest Story Tournament](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/29vlrn/doctor_who_greatest_story_tournament_final_4/cip6nb6) on /r/gallifrey, 4 out of the last 8 stories were from the Moffat era (ergo, the last 4 years made up half of the most popular stories from 50 years). 

- In the four years since Moffat took over, Doctor Who has been nominated for eleven [Hugo Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation#Short_Form) and won two (although the winners of this year are still to be announced). Steven Moffat has bagged four Hugo Awards in total so far.

- Under Steven Moffat, Doctor Who has been nominated as Most Popular Drama at the [National Television Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Doctor_Who#National_Television_Awards) every year and won in 2014.

- And finally, saving the best for last, you may have already seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1LHxwSVR_I). It’s the acceptance speech for the RadioTimes Award at the Baftas which was won by The Day of the Doctor. Producer Faith Penhale runs down a number of people to thank, including stars Matt Smith and David Tennant, whose names get about two cheers in the whole building. Then she mentions Steven Moffat and… well, you can see for yourself what happens. 

I hope you had some fun reading this. I will update this post whenever there's something to update (like new awards and stuff) and some other things over time once I get to it.

I'm looking to open a few ""current"" accounts with high interest rates to make the most from my savings. LLoyds do up to 4% on £4k, TSB do 5% on £2k (can get 2), Santander do 3% on £20k - but all require regular payments and 2 direct debits each.

I assume I can meet the regular payments requirement through standing orders from my main savings account, and standing orders to transfer the money back again.

The only problem is the direct debits. Credit cards can be paid off with direct debits. I was considering opening a number of new ""poor credit"" credit cards (2 for each account makes 8), never to use them, and set up direct debits to earn the interest rate.

However, I can see how suddenly opening 8 new credit cards at once sounds a little dodgy. I took out my first credit card only 4 months ago.

Well let me tell you...

70th minute or so of the 2005 Champions League Final, Liverpool have clawed it back to 3-3 having been 3 down and Andriy Shevchenko has an open goal to make it 4-3 and there is Djimi Traore on the line to make a goal line clearance to in a way redeem himself for the Burnley roulette and giving away the free kick for Maldini's goal but to also keep us in this match and the rest was history.

I know this wasn't the biggest moment in the match, but I do believe it deserves recognition.

PS: If someone can help me find me a clip of this I will be greatful.

I'm an Honours year Linguistics student studying at the Melbourne campus of La Trobe University Australia. For a final research assignment for one of my introductory subjects, I have been asked to create and conduct surveys. I have chosen to conduct a small language attitude survey of the Celtic languages, and have decided that reddit would probably be the best way for me to gather data within the few weeks I have to complete my assignment. As such, I'm posting this survey in about 8 different subreddits in the hope of reaching enough people to make my data valid. I'm really hoping many of you will be kind enough to take the 5-10 minutes out of your time needed to fill out my survey.

In this survey, you will be asked a series of short questions about your personal use of one or more relevant Celtic languages, as well as your personal views about their use in contemporary society. As the questionnaire is being conducted to cover several languages, the questions are worded in a way that is not specific to any of the languages in particular. There will be several multiple choice questions, as well as a few  more open ended questions that will give you the opportunity to provide a more personal opinion in some areas. These surveys are anonymous, and what little information you are asked to provide will not be used for any purposes other than the categorisation of data.

I would also like to encourage non-speakers who live in areas where these languages are spoken to provide their input and respond to the survey as well, as I would like to gauge differences in opinion between speakers and non-speakers of the languages.

If you'd like to complete my survey, please follow this link: https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/dJCNSp

Thanks. :D

So, I graduated from uni a couple of years ago, did a year abroad, and have now been working full-time for about 6 months. My personal finances are going okay, in the sense that I'm budgeting and saving and living within my means.

However, after being permanently overdrawn for 4 years during uni, and my bank closing my account and transferring my debt to a collection company while I was abroad, my credit rating almost certainly looks like hell, though I haven't looked at it.

I tried to get a phone contract in my name, but failed the credit check, so my phone contract is in my parents' name. Bills are all in my housemate's name. So I don't think I am doing anything to help my rating, though I am not in debt (excl. student loan) and am putting money in an ISA.

I vaguely remember something about being able to 'reset' it? Is this true?

The thing is, the tactic I've found most useful for budgeting is to withdraw a set amount of cash weekly and only spend that. Once the week is done, any remaining goes in a piggy bank. No in-store card purchases; if I buy something online I put the equivalent cash amount in the piggy bank. I'm finding it much, much easier to live within my means this way, but if I get a credit card for the sake of building my rating, will this work?

1. UKIP has been the fourth most popular party since the last general election. They might not have had an MP, but they had 3 x the votes of the Green Party.

2. In the lead-up to the recent elections, UKIP were polling very high - this was a big story. The Greens were not completely excluded by the media, they simply were not proving that popular - as proved by the election results. 

3. Farage has appeared in the media a lot, but this is because they're a one-man party. Count up all the times a Lib-Lab-Con minister or shadow minister has been on your TV or radio, then the picture is more balanced.

Chelsea being heavily linked with Dani Alves from Sevilla, 3 bids had been rejected from the Sevilla president considering them to be ""way below what was expected.""

Alves later revealed his dismay with Sevilla president José María del Nido for having knocked back Chelsea's offers for his services after his move to Stamford Bridge collapsed, with Chelsea signing fellow Brazilian full back Juliano Belletti for a much lower fee.

On 2 July 2008, Alves joined FC Barcelona. he official price of the transfer stood at £23 million up front, with about £7 million more depending on a number of performance-related factors.

We were not prepared to offer that amount to Sevilla and look how that turned out, Alves has gone on to arguably be one of the greatest fullbacks in history.

I can't help but get de ja vu if we don't sign him.

Now lets look at Shaw:

* Hugely talented left back with all the potential in the world
* Voted into the 2013/14 PFA Team of the Year
* Already has 60 BPL appearances 
* Has already been capped by England and is on his way to the World Cup
* A lifelong Chelsea fan

I cannot believe we aren't willing to pay £27m for this kid, Imagine him and Hazard down the left side, that partnership could become Alaba/Ribery-esque.

Summer 2013. A total-footballing Danish playmaker followed a wonder kid Argentinian winger followed an accomplished Spanish striker followed a goalscoring Brazilian midfielder, multimillion pound signings were rolling in by the week.  The eventual departure of Spurs’ Welsh Galactico just didn't seem to matter. Years of relative frugality and sensible forward planning were finally to come together. Under the stewardship of AVB’s impeccable suits and heavenly looks, the only thing that lay between Spurs and that proverbial step forward seemed to be the course of time. 

Despite Bale’s bloated transfer fee, some £80 million, Spurs’ outlay had eventually come to £107 million. For a club that prides itself on a sustainable and sensible approach to the transfer market and is restricted to a 36,000 capacity stadium, that is big. As well as the hiring of AVB’s chosen Director of Football, Franco Baldini, an actual striker had been signed, one with legs and arms and stuff, a step that Daniel Levy had been infamously reluctant to take in past windows. This was an unmistakable expression of faith in AVB’s ‘project’. After a clocking a record points tally in his first season, and very much talking the talk, he was handed a golden chance to walk the walk.

In fact, the uncannily straight-forward approach to the transfer window from the Tottenham board meant that as the air of expectation began to flood White Hart Lane, and as pundits spoke of a potential new player in the elite of the Premier League, a simple fact seemed to slip the wider conscious of us all.

That this was Tottenham Hotspur we were talking about.




Tottenham’s renaissance in the modern era began in earnest under Martin Jol. Ever since the eminently huggable Dutchman graced the club with his presence, they have slowly begun to realise their potential and to rediscover their identity. After spending the early 90’s in oblivion; acne-faced and struggling in the doldrums of the Premiership, the late 90’s and early 00’s fluctuating between the averagely mediocre and mediocrely average, it seemed that in his 3-year stint Jol had not only reminded the N17 club of where they used to be, but had equipped them with the tools to return there. Though Spurs have not exactly covered themselves in shame over the past 22 years, being one of only a handful of clubs never to have been relegated from the Premier League, they have not covered themselves in glory either, often a long way off even being the most successful club in North London.

No club is owed anything by right of their history or identity. You could argue that these concepts are purely shaped around the irrationality of football fandom, rather than being based on any kind of objectivity. Perhaps we just use them to justify supporting X over Y, when really there’s no good reason- they are nothing more than illusions we create for ourselves. Fooling ourselves that being emotionally invested in an entity so ultimately separated from us is worthwhile, that it's fate, even. Be they illusions or not, this irrationality is a part of what makes sport, sport and football, football. Look from the outside in, and it seems senseless, look from the inside out, and it’s clear. There is a certain beauty in shared irrationality, particularly when it’s shared by so many thousands.

Whatever the case, there is something persuasive indeed about that little team in N17.

The first British club to do the double, albeit 53 years ago now. The first British club to win a European trophy. Bill Nicholson, Ossie Ardiles, Glenn Hoddle. Along with Manchester United, the only club to have won a major trophy in each of the last 6 decades. This is a club with glory in its past. A footballing identity entrenched first and foremost in positive, attacking football. Invariably exciting to watch, if heart-attack inducing to support, there is often an “echo of glory” in much of what Tottenham do and it's always entertaining. There’s a reason they often provide each of Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham with their most ferocious London Derby.

Tottenham have always felt themselves above the Aston Villa’s and Everton’s of this world. Whilst they may not be able to truly identify themselves with the powerhouses of the Premier League era, even in the low moments, there has always existed something intangibly great about Tottenham. Something unique, perhaps. Few clubs are more dramatic, few clubs have such a strong idea of how they want to play the game. But to transcribe it all into a few sentences is unavoidably to do it an injustice. This sense of greatness about the club may have appeared invisible for a while, buried for years under the weight of crap performances and ambitionless owners, but it was dormant rather than disappeared. This club was always better than to be fumbling around in the back waters of the Premier League.

So when Martin Jol, appointed quite appropriately largely by accident, guided them to 5th place in 06/07, only missing out on 4th and therefore Champions League qualification in a cruel twist of culinary fate, there began to occur the collection realisation that Tottenham needn't settle for what they had; that the status quo, the Sky Sports Top 4, was not impregnable and that Spurs’ newfound ambitions were not entirely ridiculous. That this club merited more.

It is common practice for fans to dream big, to wonder about what their clubs could one day achieve, so to say that Martin Jol reinitiated this process is to overly force the narrative. What his time at the club coincided with, rather, was the realisation that dreams of Champions League and of taking the club to the proverbial next level, could one day be realised. For many years in the Premier League era, Spurs’ safety in the league was too fragile to even ponder, let alone realistically plan for, such possibilities. And there had been European nights of a kind at White Hart Lane in the recent past. But the Champions League had caught everyone’s eye now, simultaneously a means to greater things and an ends in itself, settling for an on-off loveless relationship with the Europa League might no longer be necessary.

The Champions League was perfect for Tottenham, even if she didn't yet know it. Glamorous, popular, attractive. This is what the club’s founding myth, of glory glory football and of aiming high no matter what, was destined for. Proper European nights, a return to Europe’s elite, a means to a greater reputation and to growth. This is where the modern Tottenham belonged, it was both screamingly obvious and agonizingly out of reach. A fatal combination.

And then one day it just kinda happened.

A blur of glorious, swashbuckling football. Tottenham, that little old club in N17, in the Champions League. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Tottenham- equals. It felt so right. Luka Modric dazzled, Van der Vaart glowed, Bale… Bale-d. It was the epitome of what Tottenham stood for, and how they took the competition by storm, breathing new life into it and taking many of the headlines. Bale’s hatrick heroics in the San Siro, the eventual besting of the reigning European Champions, the win against AC Milan. It was the stuff of dreams.

A Crouch red card and an Adebayor (playing for the wrong team) header or two later, and those dreams crumbled. Just like that. Knocked out in the quarter finals. It was a hell of a run, but it was over. Mummified on YouTube, but never coming back.

The Champions League indulged Tottenham’s ego, this is a club that prides itself aims high and there’s nothing greater than European glory. Considering the available resources and unlikeliness of it all, it was an outstanding showing. Daring is doing, Bill Nic’s legacy, this was Tottenham. The experience inevitably left the taste, the longing, for more of the same. 

Since then, the margins separating Spurs and Champions League qualification since then have been oh so fine, a point here, an Arjen Robben missed penalty there. It was as if fate had been intervening. Failure always coming at the crucial moment, the Champions League always so torturously out of reach.


But this season was going to be different. This was the year that poetic justice would be served, AVB would be on the way to becoming our Ferguson. We could begin the process of building sustainable success. In the past we'd been sloppy, we'd made stupid mistakes. Slurring our lines, getting nervous, messing it up. But this time, this time we were going to ask her out and she just wouldn't be able to say no. All the pieces were in place, it was just a matter of execution. AVB had been practising his lines in front of the mirror for months, Daniel Levy had bought a new cologne and had made the training ground look a lot more presentable. Sandro had even had a Brazilian wax. Just don’t fuck this up Tottenham. Who could turn down a suited up AVB? Or a hair stricken back Lamela? I know I couldn’t.

And so it began. Starting on the opening day with a scrappy 1-0 at Selhurst Park…

We failed gloriously.

The answer wasn't just a no. It wasn't a slap in the face, a throwing of the water, no, it was one worse than that. It was a snigger, a quiet, telling chuckle. As if words weren't necessary. A don’t-be-fucking ridiculous. Tottenham had created themselves this little world, one far removed from reality and how it was stunningly shattered. The narrative that would have all made sense, the steady progress, the dreams… finished. Crushed like never before. We wanted to end up with the glamorous Champions League, instead we got an unshaven Tim Sherwood. Arsenal and Liverpool’s success adding a notable sting to the tail.

Whatever the Tottenham DNA is, habitual and catastrophic collapse is a key part of it. Every club goes through peaks and troughs, but few do so as erratically and spectacularly as Spurs. Each time the cycle feels different, special, stronger than before... but it's always the same. A big new signing, an enticing new philosophy, a promising run of form, and then collapse. Spectacular collapse. Going 2-0 up, and then conceding 5. On more than one occasion. That's Tottenham in a nutshell.

And this season had it all crammed in. Marquee signings, promising signs all round that this time around it would be different, burgeoning ambition, high hopes... and then collapse. Repeated collapse. Losing repeatedly to West Ham of all teams, getting thrashed by both Liverpool and Man City at home, getting knocked out of the cup by Arsenal.

While Europa League qualification in itself can’t be considered a catastrophic failure, it was the manner in which Tottenham played this season that stung. Shambolic management, at boardroom level and of the squad, a disinterested and unmotivated majority of playing staff, the residual feeling that many of the fans were left with was simply indifference. What could have been could hardly have been further away from what was. 

But in fact once the negative emotions and regrets from the season are removed, and as memories of Tim Sherwood’s enlightened quotes fade, it’s clear that Tottenham's position is not all that bad. The squad would look a great deal better under competent management, there are gifted individuals in there and good cover for most positions. Whoever next takes the job will be greeted with a club whose potential for improvement is evident.

And when that next manager steps out into the pressroom to meet the crowds of expectant journalists, and as we begin to buy into his soundbites and be impressed with aspects of his management, the cycle, will gradually be restarting. The little bit of acquired wisdom and cynicism from this season of shambles will slowly fade. The false dawns will feel just as real as they always have done, Tottenham will still have a stadium that's too small and a fanbase that's too impatient. They'll still pride themselves on aiming high, they'll still never be able to score from corners, they'll still try to excite and entertain, but above all, they'll still remain that crucially, yet wonderfully, flawed club. Without identity, success, should it ever come, would be meaningless. It's to be embraced.

And if, God forbid, that proverbial next step is ever to be taken, then there is just one thing we can be sure of, one thing that this season has taught us above all... That it will be taken in the Tottenham way.

Not sure about others but it pains me to see a decline in critical thinking here in the UK that has allowed parties like UKIP to hold sway over a significant percentage of the population.

For the bankers it's back to business as usual, I'm sure they take great rellish in having a convenient distraction for the mob to wave their pitch forks at. Following the 2008 bailout the banks have lobbied hard against any impactful regulation that curtails their powers and would help to mitigate a global financial crisis 2.0. The problems that lead to the greatest financial crash in living memory have not been solved, they've just been kicked down the road. The associated costs will be passed down to generations to come.

Occassionally I'll switch on LBC (London's Big Conversation) and listen to the droves of bitter, miserable Brits complaining about the number of foreigners comming over here taking their jobs and benefits, whilst trying their best not to sound racist, xenophobic or lazy. It's always entertaining listening to these ludites harking back to the good ole days of failing public services and clapped out infrastructure. I get the feeling that what they're really angry about is capitalism and it's natural pursuit to reduce labour costs and squeeze out efficiencies on a quest to deliver ever more cheaper goods and services.

If closing the borders is the solution we better also consider banning the likes of automated checkouts, advanced robotics on production lines and driverless trains.. advancing technology will have a massive impact on the availability of jobs over the next 20 years, as it has done historically. It may be a lack of empathy on my part but when people complain that their jobs are being taken by foreigners willing to work for less, it's maybe time to think about getting some new skills.

I also think it's worth mentioning that those that complain the most are often the ones that enjoyed the many benefits simply inaccessible to young people today and future generations to come.

Sherwood did this club a service by bringing his son into the spotlight and if we didn't have Bentaleb during the injury crisis earlier this year, we would have been fucked (of course, had Sherwood not sent Holtby on loan in the first place, that situation would have been less uncomfortable).

In a few years, I don't doubt that Bentaleb will be a key player for us, but he's still only 19 and we already have several midfielders who deserve a spot in the team ahead of him due to seniority and experience. That said, I think we should make sure he develops as well as he possibly can, with a lot of time on the pitch. As such I can see two options:

The first option is to send him out on loan to a bottom half PL side. He is by all means good enough to secure a place in the starting XI, meaning he would get his fair share of experience playing in the Premier League, but on the other hand we might regret not having him around, especially if we have another injury crisis like last season.

My preferred option, on the other hand, is to keep him in the club. He is still only 19 and he is a very talented player, so he is bound to be playing for the U21s whenever he can, meaning he would spend time on the pitch on a regular basis.

###**#33 Centre Back Martin Demichelis**

##**STATS:**

* Appearances: 20 (13 Premier League, 4 Champions League, 1 League Cup, 2 FA Cup)

* Goals: 0

* Assists: 1

* Yellow Cards: 5

* Red Cards: 0

* WhoScored avg rating: 6.92

&amp;nbsp;

##**Comments from Reddit:**

“I'd have last season's Nastasic over Demichelis, but I'd have Demichelis over this season's Nastasic.”

“ Nastasic has been fantastic for us. Both in attitude and ability. Very very very happy to have such a promising center back in our ranks.”

&amp;nbsp;

###**Review:**

Nastasic did not have the season any of us hoped for. His first season was truly outstanding. Making his debut at the Bernabeu and putting in some outstandingly mature performances against some of the biggest names in the Premier League -Nastasic was a revelation in 12/13, and was often talked about alongside Varane as one of the hottest defensive prospects out there.

City’s backline started the 13/14 season battered by injury and struggling to adapt to Pellegrini’s style. Nastasic lost his trademark cool, on a number of occasions. Where previously his touch, composure, and passing would see him handle difficult situations with ease, this season he looked flustered, and out of ideas - opting to lump it clear rather than build methodically out of the back.

He will be keen to end the run of bad luck that saw his first City goal ruled as a Norwich own-goal, a moment of miscommunication with Joe Hart that handed Chelsea three points at Stamford Bridge (fortunately for Nastasic, Hart took the majority of the media spotlight for that one), and a mysterious knee pain that left physios stumped and ruled Nastasic out for a huge portion of the year.

Despite the poor year on the whole, Nastasic still showed moments of the player he had been the previous season. At times his skills off the ball were still better than you’d expect for a player of his age, so the ability is still there, but another season like this one could prove costly for the development of young Serb, and he (along with the rest of us) will be hoping for a return to his best for 14/15.

&amp;nbsp;

###**Summer plans:**

Serbia failed to qualify for the World Cup, meaning that Matija will likely take part in much of City’s preseason schedule and will hope to be fully up to speed with Pellegrini’s system in time to claim a regular spot in the starting eleven.

&amp;nbsp;

###**Expectations for next year:**

With another defender (likely also left-sided) expected to join this summer, Nastasic will have his work cut out if he is to become a first choice starter at City, but few expected the then 19-year-old to displace Joleon Lescott back in 2012. Nastasic can be as good as he wants to be, so with a good run of fitness it would be risky to dismiss him so soon as a backup player next year.

&amp;nbsp;

###**Overall:**

3

Does one have to be obsessed with the show to enjoy it, or will it keep my interest if it's on in the background?
--------------------------------------------------
I, generally, enjoy most sci-fi shows. Battlestar remake was really good, though I had trouble making it through the last season and thought the end lacked the mind-blowing climax that I yearned for. I've probably watched both seasons of Twin Peaks a dozen times, and it used to be within my capacity to marathon seasons in one day, but lately, at this point in my life I find it difficult to get past 3 episodes in one sitting, which, to be fair, is still 3 hours of television.
I am interested in Dr. Who, but I can't say that I have ever met casual fans of the show. It seems that, to really enjoy or get the payoff of the show, you have to be obsessed with it- watching and re-watching episodes. I just don't have the ""fan"" in me like I used to, so I'd watch an episode here and there sequentially, of course, and perhaps have a laptop on reddit in front of me as it plays in the background.

I'm a serving soldier and I'd like to sign off in the next 2-5 years as frankly I can't be arsed with this shit much longer. However, the realisation that when I do, I will literally have nowhere to go is kind of bothering me of late. 

Whilst serving I have the opportunity to buy a house and let it out (I'll live on camp) effectively having someone else pay my mortgage. This gives me the option of either using the money I'm currently saving as a deposit to overpay the mortgage or keep saving it on the side. 

Obviously whilst living in singles accommodation on camp my outgoings are laughably small so I feel I should be taking advantage of this whilst I can.

OR 

Should I cut back on the things I currently spunk my pay on (motorbikes, beer, travelling) and really ratchet up the savings to the 60/70% mark and start investing whilst my living costs are so low.

I take home roughly £1500pm (sometimes £2000, depending on whats happening) and my only financial responsibilities are:

* Phone bill 
* Van insurance
* Motorbike insurance
* Kit insurance
* PAX insurance
* Food
* Fuel

Property buying:

Pros

* I rent it out and someone, hopefully, is paying my mortgage for me.

* If no one is renting it I can claim an allowance from the army to cover travel costs to and from the house (depending on how low I can get the mortgage this may cover it).

* I'll have somewhere to call my own when I leave.

Cons

* I'll have somewhere to call my own when I leave (no more freedom)

* I'll potentially have to stay in the army longer as I'll have mortgage obligations (no more freedom)

* Maintenence costs

* Will swallow all my savings in the deposit &amp; buying fees/charges


I see three options:

* Buy a house, rent it out for more than the mortgage and contribute overpayments (keeping a bit back for repairs etc...), eating into the debt as fast as possible.

* Buy a house, rent it out and invest/save on the side.

* Don't buy a house, stockpile gold like Smaug and do something big when I leave (buy a house with a larger deposit (this less debt), round the world trip etc..)

Any thoughts on property buying whilst in this position as opposed to simply saving or investing?

----------------------------

Edit: I don't think I've explained myself very well. I'm not looking to profit from renting out the property so much as looking at getting a house a lot cheaper as someone else is paying for it. 
I'm only looking at properties I wouldn't mind living in myself in a few years most of which are already tenanted. I just feel that right now as I'm living virtually rent free, (and if I wanted to go turbo miser I could literally live off ~£150 a month) I'm wasting an opportunity.

I'm a British born (caymanian, I'd rather be called British because I love Britain) Canadian who would like to abolish rule 4 and 5. You see, when we separated, at least canada, it was because we had different political views, and were too expensive. So, we discussed it, came to an agreement, and to show we were still friends burnt down the White House together. 

Well, my dream came true 3 days ago when I arrived in London for 3 days on a tour. I almost cried with excitement. I've wanted to go since I was 6 and just a lot of emotions came up. 


Anyways, I saw this memorial in Hyde park and took 2 pictures. Here's the first, A knight representing the commonwealth and it has slayed a dragon: http://imgur.com/sMT3XvL and then this, in memory of the companionship of the glorious British and commonwealth army: 
http://imgur.com/Ezx3u5D

If that doesn't make you swell up with patriotic tears, I don't know what does.

So, therefore we should remove rule 4 and 5. We are best friends, and always will be. We may pick on each other, but we couldn't be better allies.

So, hail to Britain, canada, australia, and commonwealth army. Let us reunite once again through the internet.

Lyric:

""from a cluster of stars in a universe spinning

on a little blue dot filled with little men and women

where everyone is sinning and salvation is a concept

that they taught us out of what they deemed as love but really
wasn't

you're my cousin made of atoms only difference is the data

not the money not errata scattered all throughout the planet

shit i had it with the falsehoods none of us are truly greater

if you want it sugar coated you can suck a now and later

i wont even waste the oxygen to reload on this verse

because every breath i'm taking on the planet make it worse""


""but fuck it - we got the supernova swag

if the universe is ending lets just end it with a bang

My wife's due date is June 15th, but she could give birth any moment. 

My wife hates when I want to use things from shows/movies I like for anything serious.  For Example: She vetoed the Back to the Future theme from playing at our wedding. (Side Note: I tricked her into using a song from the 28 days later soundtrack for her ""Walk down the isle"" song).  I originally wanted to name our babies after my favorite star wars characters, but she is a fan of Star Wars and caught on.  She even Vetoed Leia!!! I thought Solo would make an AWESOME middle name for a boy, but she won't budge.  

The tables have turned now, though.  She is starting to love the name Amelia Rose.  Now I just need her to give birth before she hears either name from the tv.  

Edit: I will post pic of newborn with her name.  But my wife has to deliver first... Coming soon. 

Edit 2: Wowza! A lot of you are taking this a little harder than I thought. 

Firstly, my wife and I are choosing the name together, if it is her favorite, it wont have anything to do with the tv show that she likes it. Im sure this child will not be the first or last amelia rose.  

Secondly, my wife has a lot of trouble choosing names because of people she knows or people from television. There seems to be a reason for which every name wont work. Out of a very small list of names she liked, these two obviously stuck out for me, I put them together and we both liked it. She just doesnt know where the combo comes from. If I tell her that these two names happen to be of companions in doctor who, she'll throw it out for association and we're back on the hunt for another name.

Edit3: I should explain the title. Does make it sound like I pushed this name on to her. I suggested it, she liked it.  When writing and rereading the title, I percieved it differently than many of you are. Revised title might say suggested instead of convinced. 

Edit4: While we were walking the dog today, against my better judgement but by reddit request, I told her from where the name was inspired.  Unfortunately, she wishes I didn't tell her.  Now that she knows where the name came from, she likes it a little less.  She did not veto it completely, though, so there is still hope! The only other name in the running happens to be inspired by a character from a show we both watched: LOST (Neither of us really liked her character a ton, but we agreed we liked the name).  

Anyway, I know my wife better than anyone.  She may be picky but you guys/gals have no idea how incredibly cool she is (not to mention, beautiful).  She knows my intentions, I know hers.  Here's to hoping the name sticks so I can have my own little companion to take with me on adventures!",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,"Convinced my non-whovian wife to name our newborn girl ""Amelia Rose"".

Now that the adidas deal is done, I have a feeling there won't be many up in the market.

If it's such a massive meal and it's served at 2-3, do you normally eat a normal-sized dinner? I'm guessing most people would get hungry and eat at some point before the end of the night, but if is there generally an actual sit-down meal on Sunday evenings?

At the very end there's a striking comparison, and perhaps foreshadowing (and perhaps reassurance) regarding Agatha and Donna.

After her adventure Agatha Cristie's memory is wiped.  She then lives out the rest of her life never knowing the spectacular things that happened to her, and she never knows that she would become THE best selling novelist in the universe.

By comparison, Donna would never remember that she was ""the most important person in the universe.""  She would live the rest of her life thinking she was a nobody.

The comparison and foreshadowing seems obvious in hindsight.  The greatest novelist in the universe, and the most important person in the universe, both never knowing how much they matter.

The part I found somewhat reassuring, and gives a glimmer of hope regarding Donna's tragic tale, is:

DOCTOR, ""Thing is, I don’t think she ever quite forgot. Great mind like that, some of the details kept bleeding through.""

Well just a quick introduction, I'm @LFCImpulse on Twitter, and I'm thinking of making a weekly post talking about topics given to me by my followers and friends on Twitter (not that I'm a hotshot or anything). 

For this week: 
""@AzzurriLFC: @LFCImpulse How should BR strengthen his side this summer. Presuming he has a £50m kitty excluding sales + added obstacle of WC disrupting the possibility of signing too many players. Limit to 6 fresh faces max :)""

(https://twitter.com/azzurrilfc/status/470594093643362304 and https://twitter.com/azzurrilfc/status/470594255929352192)

So here we go! 

Well first and foremost, with over a 100 goals scored, we know where our strengths lie - going into games looking to attack quickly and swiftly. That's exactly what high-energy players like Luis Suárez gets you. That's what players with blistering pace like Raheem Sterling, or players with amazing all-round ability like Daniel Sturridge gets you. 

The biggest worry for LFC - the back-line, and the defensive mentality among the players. A close second - defensive midfield. 

So, assuming I've only £50mil to work with, let's get to it:

**1) Left-back**
Jon Flanagan, while improved, isn't going to cut it for the Champions League. He's a hard, and mostly-sure tackler. Very hardworking, very passionate, but he still had a lot of glaring flaws - from poor positioning, to unawareness, to being uncomfortable on the ball beyond 5 seconds. 

With £50mil, I'd easily splash 40% of it on *Filipe Luis* or *Ricardo Rodriguez*, arguably two of the best LB's we've seen this season, and both at least £10mil cheaper than Luke Shaw, and both performed better than Alberto Moreno. 

**2) Right-back**
Do I really need to start with Glen Johnson? I've tried defending him this season, but he's just been so disappointing. £100+k per week? Not worth it. 

*Nathaniel Clyne* for £15mil would be a good deal, though I think it's towards the upper end of his valuation range. *De Sciglio* of AC Milan has also been fantastic and will definitely jump at the chance to play for a CL team. *Daryl Janmaat* of Feyenoord is also arguably the best Eredivisie and Dutch RB this season. 

*Tony Jantschke* has been arguably one of the best Bundesliga RB this season bar Philip Lahm, and then you have *Gōtoku Sakai* who can actually play both RB and LB. You also have *Serge Aurier* (who seems Arsenal-bound) who would fit us excellently given that he plays more like a right-midfielder than a right-back in attacking transitions. 

In short: a ton of RB's available, all perhaps available for an average price of £10-12mil. 

**3) Defensive-midfielder**
Lucas? He's been overrated for years now. *Emre Can*? One for the future. Splash the cash on his £10-12mil fee, and you'll have a solid all-rounder of a midfielder for the next 4-5 years at least.

Emre Can is perhaps the best value-for-money midfielder we need in the market at the moment. Really good on the ball, young prospect, defensively sound, versatile (plays literally everywhere in defence and midfield). Let's say £12mil for him.

**4) Wide-forward**
Well with only £8mil left, I'm just gonna break the rules a bit and extend it to £12mil - exactly enough for *Yehven Konoplyanka*.

I've commented in many threads in January 2014 about what to expect if Konoplyanka joined us back then - and it's the same answer now. You'll get a speedy demon who's mercurial, good with both feet, unpredictable dribbling, and a really good final ball. 

**5) Goalkeeper**
Two free agents are available in the summer, and while we could go for someone like Hugo Lloris, or Willy Caballero, I think it's important to note that Simon Mignolet will always be first-choice, and thus, we cannot afford to pay high fees and wages for two goalkeepers. 

Anyway, the first free agent - *Julian Speroni*. It is a crime that he's not selected for Argentina for the World Cup, but he was an outstanding keeper in the league this season. With Crystal Palace looking to pounce on John Ruddy, we should definitely consider Speroni. 

The next one? From newly-promoted Leicester City - *Kasper Schmeichel*, who's also a free agent if he does not sign a new contract. Not as good as Speroni, but definitely worth looking at. 

**Conclusion**
So with that, £54mil spent on Rodriguez/Filipe Luis (£20mil), one of the many right-backs I mentioned (£10mil on average), Emre Can (£12mil), and Yehven Konoplyanka (£12mil). Oh, and a cheeky free-agent there in the goalkeeping department. 

In that, we would've upgraded on the two full-back areas, added a young, versatile and talented midfielder, a world-class wide-player and an experience keeper to provide competition as well as adequate back-up. 

So, leave comments, add players to the list, and spark discussion. Quick disclaimer: it's all purely opinion-based - there's nothing that's set in stone here. Also, all figures are very rough estimates except a fair few.
