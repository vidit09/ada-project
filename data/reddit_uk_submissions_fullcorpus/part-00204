First off, yes I know it was difficult. Sorry.. If there's call I can do much easier ones in the future?

So here are the answers. As there were not many entrants I'll explain where I've given the scores. Let me know if you wish to challenge anything! I'm trying to be lenient.

.

**1. If I were like *Dromaeosaurus*, where would I be found?**

* Answer: Denmark! - No points to anyone :/
* The question is based on [*Dromaeosauroides*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromaeosauroides), whose name in Greek literally means ""Like *Dromaeosaurus*"". 

.

**2. When did the dinosaurs go extinct?**

* [They didn't!](http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fabulous-gif.gif) - One point to Batgirl and Clackpot.

.

**3. a) What is the largest species of *Canis* ever?**

* The dire wolf, *Canis dirus*. Point to Batgirl and Battle4.

.

**b) What is the largest species of Canine ever?**

* The dire wolf, *Canis dirus*. Yeah, I'm such a dick. Point to Batgirl.

.

**c) What is the largest species of Canid ever?**

* *Epicyon haydeni*, which lived during the most of the Miocene Epoch and a little of the Pliocene. No points.

.

*Note- given half a point to Clackpot for English Mastiff because I didn't word the question particularly well to start with.*

.

**4. a) Which museum has the largest mounted dinosaur skeleton in the world?** 

 * Clue's in the title, it's in the Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin. - Point to Clackpot and Battle4.

.

**b) What type (genus) of dinosaur was it?**

 * *Giraffatitan*, previously a species of *Brachiosaurus* until it was recently found to be different enough from the North American species to warrant a new genus. - Point to Clackpot, half to Batgirl and Battle4.

.

**5. a) What is the largest carnivorous dinosaur?**

 * There are a few different possible answers (in terms of heavliest/longest/largest wingspan), but generally some of the larger condors or eagles. Point to Batgirl.

.

**b) What was the largest carnivorous dinosaur?**

* *Spinosaurus aegyptigus*. Point to Batgirl and Clackpot.

.

**6. Which dinosaur is twinned with a constellation?**

* One of my favourite questions. The answer is *Geminiraptor*. The clue was in the question! Nil poi.

.

**7. [Name the family to which this dinosaur belongs](http://four.flash-gear.com/npuz/puz.php?c=v&amp;id=3900130&amp;k=67997179). (Wait a few seconds for it to load.)**

* The animal belongs to the Therizinosauridae. One of the most recognisable families of dinosaurs with the massive claws, pot belly and tiny head. See [Walking with Dinosaurs: The Giant Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCVdj71ooT0) for info! Point to Clackpot. Batgirl, your 'palaeo' friend should know better!

- *Sorry if this took a while, I had a go myself and it took just over 2 hours, although I didn't have enough time to make a slightly easier version (you can chose the size of jigsaw piece when making them on the site) as I finished it just 5 minutes before I had to leave for Berlin. Sorry!*

.

**8. Which dinosaur is famous for dancing like Michael Jackson?**

* No points here. The answer is the Red Capped Manakin, *Ceratopipra mentalis*. [Here's a documentary clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI_quJRRGxk) explaining, featuring a scientist making a fool of themselves to boot!

.

**9. Only one animal has gone extinct twice. How long did it last the second time around?**

* The Pyrenean Ibex, *Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica*, went extinct in 2000, until one female was cloned in 2009. The animal lasted 7 minutes before dying of lung problems. Half a point to Clackpot.

.

**10. The iPad-teeth lived during which period of geological time?**

* The Triassic Period. The question refers to the placodonts, or 'tablet teeth'. They were an early group of marine reptiles that had a [large range of forms](http://oceansofkansas.com/images2/figure1.jpg). Point to Battle4.

.

**11. Which long crocodile lived in the Triassic of Germany?**

* No points again. *Dolichosuchus* was the answer, whose name means ""Long crocodile"".

.

**12. Which Abelisaurid was thought to be mimicking the bird mimics?**

* No points. *Ornithomimoides* is the answer, ""Like bird mimics"". The Ornithomimosauridae are another group of theropod dinosaurs, featuring reasonably well known dinosaurs such as *Galli*... *Galli*... *Gallimimus!*

.

**13. a) What is the largest carnivoran in the Uk?**

* Seals are the correct answer! Point to Battle4 and clackpot.

.

 
**b) What was the largest carnivoran in the Uk during the Ice Ages of the Pleistocene?**

* The answer is surprisingly the walrus! No points here. It just pips the larger bears that roamed here at the time.

.

**14. If my face, and more specifically my nose were to not have a horn, what would be my name?**

* The answer is one of my very favourite dinosaurs, *Arrhinoceratops*, whose name translates from the ancient Greek as ""No nose horn face"". Point for Clackpot.

.

**15. a) What is the shorthand term for the extinction event that killed off many types (~60% of species)  of animal at the end of the Cretaceous Period?**

* The K/Pg extinction. Not the K/T. The 'T' stands for Tertiary, which was only an informal term for the Period following the Cretaceous. The Pg stands for Palaeogene, the first Period following the Cretaceous (the K comes for the German for Cretaceous). One point to Clackpot, half to Batgirl and Battle4.

.

**b) When did that happen? (Looking for a number of millions of years, not a range.)**

* 66Ma. For a long time it was thought to be 65Ma, then 65.6Ma and more recently it has moved to 66, each time with new dating methods. One point to Batgirl, half to Clackpot.

.

**16. Why do many 2D and some 3D dinosaurs have broken wrists?**

* Theropod dinosaurs are regularly depicted with the palms of their hands facing down, which is incorrect. They would have to break their wrists to get them in this position. They should actually be 'pronated', with the palms facing inwards. Point to Batgirl.

.

**17. What genre of art depicts extinct animals?**

* Quite simply, palaeoart! Point to Battle4 and Batgirl. We do like shoving 'palaeo' infront of things to mean an ancient version. Palaeobiology, palaeocurrent, palaeosalinity, palaeoecology, palaeoenvironment, palaeobathymetry and palaeodiet to name but a few.

.

**18. Here is a list of generic (pertaining to genus or genera, the taxonomic level above species) names: i) *Brontomerus* ii) *Brontosuchus* iii) *Brontotherium* iv) *Brontosaurus* v) *Brontoscorpio***

**a) Which of the above is a dinosaur?**

* i) *Brontomerus* was a sauropod. *Brontosaurus* was famously synonymised with *Apatosaurus* (as they were found to be the same animal and *Apatosaurus* was named first), but the name is now invalid and not linked to anything as far as I know. Point to Battle4.

.

**b) Which of the above lived the longest ago?**

* *Brontoscorpio* is the correct answer! Point to Battle4 and Clackpot.

.

**c) Which of the above lived the most recently?**

* *Brontotherium*. Point to Clackpot and Battle4.

.

**d) Which of the above was made up?**

* *Brontosuchus*. Point to Clackpot and Battle4.

.

**19. Which type of starfighter featuring in a *Star Wars* Tv show is actually based on a dinosaur vertebra?**

* The Umbaran Starfighter from *Clone Wars*. [Here's the proof!](http://svpow.com/2012/12/15/heck-yes-the-umbaran-starfighter-from-clone-wars-was-inspired-by-an-apatosaurus-vertebra/) Point to Clackpot.

.

**20. a) Which numpty of a 19th century palaeontologist lost what may have been the fossils of the largest animal ever?**

* Edward Drinker Cope. One of the most famous of the historical palaeontologists. Great 'tache. Point to Clackpot.

.
**b) What was his planned gift for all of human-kind?**

* He offered his body to be used as the holotype specimen for *Homo sapiens* upon his death. A holotype is a specimen designated to define what a species is, i.e. any new material must match the holotype. His offer was turned down, however. No points.

.

**c) Who did he have a famous 'long-running-spat' with?**


* Point to Clackpot for Othneil Charles Marsh. Alongside Cope one of the most famous historical palaeontologists.

.

**d) What was the name of said 'long-running-spat'?**

* The [""Bone Wars""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Wars) is correct, one final point to Clackpot. The two spent years trying to find the most and best dinosaurs and other extinct animals in North America. Someone needs to make a movie about it, there are some great stories in there, such as Cope placing *Elasmosaurus*' head on the end of its short tail instead of immense neck.

.

So, there we go. The scores are:

* /u/Clackpot 16.5
* /u/Battle4Aspen 10.5
* /u/BatgirlPJs 9.5

Thanks for participating guys! I'll see if I can think of some small prize or something because I know it must have been a pain!

A few of friends are hosting a video game event at a local pub with Kotaku. Some of you will be aware of the regular biweekly Sticky Mike's game nights but for those who aren't this event should be good fun. It's a nice atmosphere and worth checking out. If you have any questions then feel free to ask me or better yet check out the facebook link. 

Anyways hope to see you there :)

'Join us for our 4th Kotaku UK games and beer night with The Fight Lab on November 12th at Sticky Mike's Frog Bar in Brighton! Starting from around 7, we'll have loads of excellent multiplayer games to try out, good tunes, and lots of super-nice people.

We'll be bringing Mario Kart 8 on Wii U, Towerfall Ascension on PS4, Gang Beasts on PC, Bumpy's Party on Wii U, Goldeneye and Smash Bros on the N64, and more - plus original Game Boy Tetris, complete with link cable.

There'll also be a Smash Bros 3DS tournament, if you fancy it - sign up through the link below, and just check in when you arrive. We'll be running it in the 'For Glory' format and it will be a double elimination tournament bracket.'

So - we have just opened an English language school, mainly targeted at European working migrants.   Our USP is that we only have a maximum of 6 students per class, which is quite different from the 15 per class in the larger schools.   

The prices are fairly reasonable too, and we do actually give a shit about our students - again, not something the bigger schools in town worry themselves with.

Anyway, why am I posting this here?  I thought maybe to spread the word a bit, get some honest feedback on the website, and connecting with any other Redditor English teachers in Liverpool would be good too.

until last night I was employed via an agency at a white-goods manufacturer in the north west, my role was to diagnose faults and send out engineers to faulty appliance if needed. at 16:30 I was called into the office and asked to leave the company due to a complaint from a retailer that had been sent to the MD due to myself telling a customer that as the appliance had been bought only 2 days earlier they could return to the retailer for an exchange, (this is from my understanding of the sales of goods act.) it's something I had always said to any customer during my 5 months there. When I questioned the employer on this, they acknowledged that this was a legal right of the customer but I had damaged relationships with the retailers by advising the customer of this. They hinted that my attitude was also not appropriate but would not go into any specifics when asked. (every review i had had with them up till last night was in fact glowing.)

Any thoughs?

“Dear MP / Prospective MP

I am very concerned about the changes that have taken place in the NHS, and worry we are moving towards a marketised system of healthcare provision such as they have in the United States. I believe we must taken urgent action to prevent this from taking place, as detailed below.

1:  Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should be scrapped, existing contracts should be renegotiated or brought out at the soonest possible opportunity.

2: No hospital closures should not take place in West Yorkshire over the course of the next Parliament.

3: We should support and expand local A&amp;E and maternity provision in the region.

4: We should fully oppose the EU-USA trade deal (TTIP) that makes NHS privatisation irreversible while it contains any ISDS clauses, acknowledging that any attempt to exempt the NHS from such a deal will be futile while such a clause exists

5: Ensure adequate staffing in hospitals, GP practices &amp; community care. We should listen to concerns from NHS staff &amp; patients to improve the NHS, and take greater steps to ensure whistle-blowers are protected and empowered to speak out.

6: A two or multi-tier heath service with uneven standards and service provision is immoral and unacceptable, the marketisation of the NHS should be undone with the abolition foundation status hospitals / trusts and their reintigration back into the NHS.

7: Health care services should be free at the point of delivery for all service users, means testing should not be required to access services.

Could you confirm if you support the following actions and statements? I would appreciate a clear yes or no answer to each point, and while any elaboration on your reasoning would be welcome, the clarity of your position on these matters is of paramount importance with the General Election taking place in the next six months.

Many thanks

I'm in my last year of uni and have been thinking about my financial situation seriously for the first time.

I'm quite lucky as a student in that my dad has paid for my accommodation throughout uni meaning my student loan just goes towards living costs such as food, bills (elec, water etc) and day to day living. As a consequence, (and request from my dad who didnt want to 'complicate' things) my bank account is still the same as the one my dad opened for me when i was ~14. 

But now I have considered my finances seriously, I have realised how many benefits i have missed out on not opening a student account. Now I'm in my final year, most banks wont allow me to open one since a requirement is to be confirmed for 2+ years of study. This leads me to a couple of questions:

* Is it too late to open a student account with an overdraft for my final ~half year of uni?

* Will the fact that I have never had an overdraft effect my credit scores for when I graduate and possibly apply for credit?

* Will not having a student account stop me for getting a graduate bank account next year?


Finally, again I am lucky, I have a job offer already from an internship I did this summer with a starting salary of just over 21k (in a northern city). Do you have any advice as to what I should be doing now and over the next year to prepare for being a proper grown up with a full time job?

Thanks for reading

Sorry to be so cynical about the electorate, but I've seen these opinions countless times on reddit and elsewhere. Statements such as, ""he's not statesmanlike/prime ministerial, imagine him making demands to obama/putin"".

Let's look at some of the actions of the Labour leader vs the current prime minister (a bit of cherry picking here but feel free to provide counter examples):

Ed Miliband stood up to parliament on the vote for military action in Syria*, despite inevitable media backlash; he stood up to Murdoch in the Levenson inquiry. The man has shown himself capable of standing up to powerful people, not being intimidated, and even being successful in his battles.

Compare this to Cameron. He keeps trying to 'stand up to the EU' and just embarrasses the whole country in the process. He tried to stop Juncker getting appointed and ended up alienating the UK and harming its relationship with allies such as Germany. He tried to wriggle out of TV debates where he might actually have to tell the electorate what he stands for.

His party keep hemorrhaging MPs to UKIP so he pretends to 'stand up to the EU' from this £1.7bn bill and utterly failed, they didn't save the country a penny, the money will be taken from the country's rebate.


Who out of the two potential prime ministers would really be better at standing up to foreign authorities (obama/putin)?

Since then, I've not got a location on it so it is possible that the bus driver might have found it or someone handed it to the bus driver and it's been turned off.

A friend of mine's manager recently went on maternity leave, to be replaced by a new manager who is, by the sounds of things, a right twat. 

She has threatened another employee with a disciplinary for a minor issue, and now, today, my friend, who has worked for 4 years without any kind of disciplinary issues or complaints as to the standards of her work, has been told she will be facing a disciplinary for 3 issues: 

- Absence on two occasions: 

She has email evidence backing up the fact that she received permission in one instance to attend the doctors. (To attend a breast cancer scare mammogram.)

In the other instance she was attending a company meeting at a different building. She has emails to prove this too. 

- Attitude:

As for her attitude... well, the manager who has gone on maternity leave is likely going to be the one who accompanies my friend to the disciplinary. This manager has had zero issue with her attitudes, and, knowing the girl, I can't really envision why anyone would have a problem with her attitude in general. She's hard working and reasonable, imo. Of course, I'm biased. But still...

Any advice on how to effectively combat this? Thanks in advance.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,default,Unfair Disciplinary at work - Advice,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2m37wy/unfair_disciplinary_at_work_advice/

Looking forward to mod 2 now. Fingers crossed.

I was born in England but did my GCSE &amp; A-levels in the Isle of Man, therefore I am classed an IOM student, meaning am not eligible for Student Loans from the UK.

My Government pays £6,500 of the £9,000 a year and I pay the remainder £2,500 once I finish university. My parents pay for my accommodation and give me allowance every week, it's not how I wanted it with them paying but I don't have a choice.

But because I am an IOM student, I am not eligible for a lot of the grants given to university students, for example every student will get around £500 off the university, so long as they're from the UK. Even though I am born in the UK and was there till I was 10 I'm not allowed them.

With an unpaid summer placement taking up all my time, I won't be able to work as I have done in previous summers to financially balance me during university.

The essentials are: I'm struggling financially, I can't ask for anymore money off my parents, the University aren't able to give me financial support and my government have give me a grant (albeit very small) but won't offer me anymore support. Is there any way for me to get some form of grant/money?

I want to hear why we should/should not have patience. So please respect others opinion and present you own in this thread.  

So I will start: Here is my opinion on the situation

Right now it hurst me to watch Liverpool, I drag myself to the tv with nothing but low expectations every game. Last year we took a giant leap towards that golden sky, only to get sucked in to the storm again. It's painful, it's humiliating but why are we freaking out? 
I genuinley think we have something great just around the corner. 

We do not have the money to do what Scums did, what Chelsea and City has done earier. So why not let this take som time. We will probably not finish top 4 this season, thats just the way it is. That means that we can't do what we did this summer, even if we had the money. We have to trust what we have and I think that will be perfectly fine, probably just have to buy a keeper. We have always been so fucking quick to judge players, Hendo and Lucas are the first to come to mind. But I if you remember when Suarez came in, everyone and I mean everyone said we needed another striker because Suarez wasn't clinical enough, and he really wasn't. But with some time Suarez became one of the most dangerous finishers, not only in england but the whole world. So what says that Balotelli won't start scoring, or Sterling or Lallana or ever Borini. 

Im tired of the short term thinking and success now, my opinion is let this team grow, just have patience. 

Coutinho, Sterling, Can, Markovic, Sturridge, Balotelli, Moreno, Hendo, Sakho. All these are under 25(studge 25), that is promising in my eyes. 

We'll se said the zen master



What are you're opinion on this. 
Should we have patience? Or should we panic. 

Why do we need success now?

For some reason, the water temperature has never been hot enough since I moved in in August, and it's just been getting worse as the temperature gets colder. I set the knob to as high as it will go and it is still not nearly warm enough. I'm not saying that absolutely freezing water is coming out; it's heated water, but it's not *hot* water. I am not trying to scald my skin off -- I would just like to take a god damn shower and not come out shivering, quite literally shivering.

I spoke to the accommodation office about it and they said ""yeah, we've been hearing that from some people; we'll take a look at the whatever-whatever [some kind of individual water thermostat thing, I gathered] outside your room and see if that will help"". When I got back that evening, my showerhead had been deviated to the wall, so I could only assume they messed with something then went in to test the water. I optimistically started the shower . . . no change.

The housing office had told me that the water was set to a certain temperature for Health and Safety reasons. That's well and good in theory, but it's madness because as I said, I have it set to the hottest it will go and there is no danger of burning yourself on tepid water. Furthermore, I have friends at a building on the same street and have resorted in desperation to using their shower a couple of times, and their water is fine. For God's sake, I was in a youth hostel this summer and the hot water was out of this world. I find it hard to believe that Health and Safety would mandate a water temperature this low.

I Googled extensively for answers and didn't really find advice for people who didn't have control over their own water heater. A common problem people seem to have is that their water temperature or pressure fluctuates wildly; mine doesn't. The pressure is fine, and the temperature just wavers between wait-this-is-a-bit-hotter-just-a-little-more-would-be-good and just-kidding-I-only-did-that-to-get-your-hopes-up. I was going to get a water thermometer and tell the housing office the temperature I was getting, but I couldn't find any good info online about what constitutes an acceptably-hot shower. All I found were the same old Health and Safety things concerning Legionnaire's disease.

Another possibly important thing to note is that my bathroom sink (although not my kitchen sink, though both have mixer taps) can indeed get scalding.

Considering the price I'm paying, I don't believe it's asking too much to have water that is liveably hot. It's really putting a strain on my life to have to work myself up to taking a shower because I dread it so much. 

What I'd like to know is if there is any sort of legal regulation that states the landlord's responsibility in this regard, and advice on anything else I can do or say to them to help fix this.

I'm a recent graduate engineer (graduated last year, so have 1 year of experience so far). I have a large chunk of money in my accounts, ~£25k just sitting doing not a lot. This was money saved from living at home and taking the student loan. I also earn £26k/annum. As soon as the paper-work comes through, I'll be investing in my pension, doing the maximum pay-in that my company matches (I think it's 10% off the top of my head)
Apart from student debt, I have no other debts.

Until the middle of next year I will be living home with my parents, before moving out, probably flat sharing on the outskirts of Coventry, as my job is moving to the other side of town, and I feel that'll be too tough a commute long-term.

Initially, I had thought about using that money as a deposit for a house, but there are a few factors that come against that. 
--&gt;I could only get a deposit for ~£150k, which severely reduces what I can buy around here. 
--&gt;I'm quite young, I can't be certain that I'll be staying at the same company for many years. 

I have another 2 years in my graduate rotation scheme and whilst I can then continue in the job as a non-graduate, I can't be certain if that's what I'd want yet. Therefore I'm not sure buying a house here would be a good investment, unless I could buy-to-rent sort of thing (or at least buy, live there for 2-3 years and then if I move jobs continue to rent it out, as I believe selling it after such a short time wouldn't be a good investment).

Looking around, I see that I could get a 2 year fixed ISA, at 2%, so could max that out and at the end probably have got around £600 (I think, I may be wrong), which doesn't seem a lot of return, but maybe I'm trying to be too greedy? I'm not someone that will eagerly/frequently sit down and worry about the stock market and its permutations, so I'm thinking the Stocks &amp; Shares ISA isn't for me.

I hope I've written this out clear enough to follow.

EDIT: I have just thought, I've wondered about investing in Premium Bonds. While I know it's not a guaranteed interest rate, I've heard that once you've invested £5000+ you're likely to win often, even just the £25 prizes, which could add up over 2-3 years?",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,"£26k/a, about that in accounts, NISA?",10,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2m3ohr/26ka_about_that_in_accounts_nisa/

What caught my attention was that Mark is a business owner (Cambridge Green Cleaning Services) and as one of the other panel members pointed out that a van belonging to his business was filmed side swiping a cyclist. Listen from 29:00 into the show. [Radio Cambridgeshire](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02b386l). Mark seems to find it highly amusing.

I just did a search and indeed [there is footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV2Txk8bzBs) of one of what looks like one of the drivers deliberately swiping across a cyclist. What follows is a confrontation during which the driver denies any wrong doing and tells the cyclist to phone the company.

I'm sure that just like any other city subreddit you're probably completely tired of being inundated with ridiculous questions and hypothetical situations from silly foreigners like me, so I apologize in advance for this post, but I have to try to ask the question or I'll never forgive myself. Here's a little bit about my situation:

I'm 26 and I possess both a Canadian and a UK passport (without residence status), my partner and I currently live in Canada and are kind of sick of it... nothing really seems to be going well here and we're currently living in a city we both sort of hate... We are both well educated people, both with BAs and MAs (albeit in the Social Sciences), and have some (keyword being ""some"") employable skills. My eventual hope/plan is to be able to attend the University of Edinburgh for a graduate program (I have been accepted there once before), but we are both currently in the sort of place where we should be working and making money in hopes of acquiring some savings, prior to returning to school. We both want out of Canada and are hoping to live in Edinburgh as soon as possible but the problem we are having is identifying employment opportunities. Now I understand that the UK is one of the fastest rebounding economies post-recession and that (when I last checked) Scotland was the fastest growing economy within the UK, but the unfortunate reality is that I am having a really tough time identifying what the employment market looks like throughout Scotland, and perhaps most specifically within your glorious city. My partner and I both feel confident that we will eventually be living there regardless but the big question that we are sort of toying with right now is whether or not it would make more sense to head across the pond earlier rather than later. We have already lived abroad in Asia together before and we know its what we want. That, plus my citizenship are really helpful steps in the right direction toward getting there, but I guess we're both just left wondering right now... If we packed up the little bit we cared about, bought plane tickets, and flew on over... would we be completely screwed?? Thank you so much for any potential assistance with this question, I understand that some aspects of what I am asking are vague and that isn't really my intention. I guess I am just sort of confused about the whole European employment landscape in general, but still dying to get over there as soon as possible. I am pretty well just seeking guidance of any kind. Is it impossible to find work in Edinburgh right now? Could even finding crap work provide enough money to subsist? Could I even find crap work? These are just a few of my many questions. If anyone would like further clarification regarding anything I've written please don't hesitate to mention it.

I was practicing quidditch. Me and someone else were both running towards the ball. And his shoulder hit my face. I was on the floor for a minute and in pain. 

The guy I collided with was fine but was really worried about me. We were on a field just outside the library and union. As we were walking to the union to find a first aider my friend told me that he was worried my jaw was fractured!

Arrived at the union - the most qualified first aider had gone home 5 minutes earlier. They suggested either going to the walk in centre or to phone me a non emergency ambulance. 

We went to the walk in centre as it's nearer and less drama. But they sent us to the hospital as it was head trauma. I don't really rember all of the journey there. We got te uni bus to the nearest stop then walked. 

I saw 3 different doctors/nurses. Turned out that my jaw isn't fractured. I probably pulled some tendons and ligaments in my face and neck though. So I'm probably going to be in even more pain tomorrow. 

We were both starving after the hospital so we stopped for KFC which is conveniently on the way home from the hospital.

I'm 23, male, pale skin which seems to be a combination of oily on the top of the nose and dry / flakey on the sides and cheek area. I've seen a dermatologist and my GP for the last 2-3 years for what could be rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis (they're unsure, as am I) mostly on the side of my nose and slowly spreading to my cheeks. This also has the side effect of small scabbing down the creases of my nose,  like a fungal infection, that has been there for nearly 12 months - seems to struggle to heal.

Current skin state at the moment. A big red angry spot on forehead as well as a lot of redness / flaking / scabbing along the crease of my nose, on top and the cheeks! http://imgur.com/a/lhyZO 

Looking to get into a decent skincare routine and general habits to hopefully clear up my skin as best as possible. It used to be clear-ish around 18 months ago, aside from patchy redness on the side of my nose. Would be great to get back to that stage or even better :)

My current skincare routine is basically Boots Foaming Cleanser (which I think might be drying out my skin further) and some old Nivea moisturiser which I'm going to throw out! If anyone could give me an idea of where to start that would be hugely appreciated, especially with a moisturiser and cleanser. Unsure if I need to be looking at exfoliation yet or not to deal with PIH?

Also, I've read through quite a few of the wiki pages / SCA sidebar &amp; reviews on here; but I've just got a few more questions as I'm still overwhelmed by most of this!

1. If I work inside during daylight hours, is there any need for suncream or moisturiser with an SPF?
2. Toners? I have no idea what they're for! Are they beneficial?
3. What's best for dealing with large upcoming spots? BP seems popular but I genuinely have no clue.
4. BB creams, I saw a review saying these were a potentially good all-in-one for moisturising, skin tone and concealing - is this anything to look in to?
5. I heard something about skincare products with green in can cancel out some of the red? I'm trying to avoid makeup where possible, but I'd be open to something just to take the redness out of my skin for times when I really need it (meetings etc.)

List of medications tried and currently on:

* Nizoral (currently used to treat side of nose scabbing / fungal infection)
* Pro-Topic 0.03% (supposed to start this soon)
* Aknemycin Plus
* Daktacort 2% / 1% 
* Duac 5% / 1%
* Epiduo 0.1% / 2.5%
* Erythromycin Tablets
* Lymecycline Capsules
* Metronidazole 0.75%
* Oxytetracycline Tablets
* Zineryt Lotion

* Maybelline has a duo which includes a brow pencil and brow powder. (It's a twist up liner on one end, like Anastasia - unless another brand did it first.) They've had their brow gel out for a while now, longer than the others.
* Collection - I don't know how long they've had it! - has a trio of brow powders that is packaged with a clear brow gel.
* No. 17 has a brow kit. It has the works: powder, wax, highlighter, pencil (mini) and a brush.
* Eyelure has re-released brow pencils with a new formula (according to the packaging) and it has a spoolie on one end.
* I was in Poundland and they had a series of brow pencils in various colours (quite a decent looking blonde one, very hard texture, you need a spoolie if you're willing to work with it).

I'm not complaining. In fact I'm very impressed. Has anyone else noticed the same thing, or am I just behind the times?

I am curious about a current fashion trend I'm seeing in my town.
It involves wearing a woolen cap, as far back upon the head as it will rest, with a well manicured 'swoosh' of hair swept from one side to the other. 

What the fuck is this?  It seems like the worst of both worlds.  You wear a hat that does not keep you warm, or serve the purpose of a hat; and you have to style your hair anyway - one of the benefits of a hat is you do not have to style your hair!  

What is this called?  (apart from fucking stupid)

I've had enough of London public transport and I'm looking to get a motorbike and to be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing.
All I know is I've wanted a bike for a looooong time. 

As a first bike, I'm scouring eBay, auto trader, etc. trying to find a bargain as I don't want to spend too much on my first bike. Ideally I want something cheap to commute around London on(not a moped though).

What do I need to look out for when buying used bikes and do you have any tips regarding buying bikes?

Thanks, so much!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the helpful comments!

hey guys, I made a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeedsUnited/comments/2hdzau/i_want_to_support_leeds/) a while ago saying that I chose Leeds to support in the Championship and I've tried my best to keep up with a lot of the news and stuff with the club but unfortunately haven't been able to watch a game with my current situation and being that I live in the US and Leeds are never shown on bein sport sadly.  I don't care how long it takes me to find a good stream or anything, I WILL watch the Leeds game on that sunday, I marked it down on my calendar.  I can't wait to really start supporting this club.

Edit: Oh, forgot to mention this - I plan on going to Barcelona to visit my family and watch Barca (my main club) play and we will probably be in England as well for a bit.

I'm analyzing whether *Day of the Doctor* can truly be considered a worthy fiftieth anniversary special.

My criteria for judging the quality of this episode as an anniversary special will be how well it focuses on the past (inclusion of any prior canon within the fifty years--I'm particularly interested in Classic Who), fits into the present (is it a decent plotline on its own?), and looks ahead to the future (how the episode clues us in on, and gets us excited for, things to come).

I've got my own points I want to make for each of these, but I was wondering if /r/doctorwho had anything they would want to weigh in on. Especially those who have seen/grew up with Classic Who. I haven't seen much of it, so any insight Classic Who fans can provide would be great! For example, do you feel *The Day of the Doctor* focused just on NuWho, or was Classic Who appropriately included?

Rodgers likes to play with three at the back now, often with Gerrard being the third CB, when we play out of the back now.  This would give them a little more protection to not rely on the fullbacks to get all the way back.  

Two up front is self-explanatory here as everyone is clamoring for it and knows that we lack anyone that can operate as a lone striker.  

The midfield can be tailor made to fit whatever opposition we face.

Let's start with some questions. How are you today, and do you have anything nice to look forward to this weekend?

I'd like to reiterate that The Running Man is a 1980s masterpiece, and if you weren't around in the 80s, you should watch it to experience the music, hairstyles and clothing, which are hideously LOLsome but also very accurate, but also because it's a great film (The Hunger Games was probably partially stolen from it) and Arnie kicks arse in it (and looks very buff, not that I usually look at Arnie that way, because, well, it's like oggling your granddad - your granddad who used to do porn films, that is).

In the last few seasons we've sold:

Huddlestone

Livermore

Sigurdsson

Sandro

Dempsey

Dawson

Caulker

and quite a few others.

My opinion is that I don't think many of them are world-class players who would set the world alight, but they are all decent players who would be better squad players than what we currently have. For example, I think Caulker is a better player than Chiriches, who was bought to replace him. I think Dempsey, for all his flaws, provided more Premier League goals than Soldado has. I think that Sandro and Livermore could both do the job that Capoue does.

I can only buy 1 laptop per year from the store.

I purchased a laptop which is too small so I want to return it. I purchased it on the 6th of November. The laptop is also noisy and the noise is NOT coming from the fan section and is an abnormal noise that is audible.

I rang the store and was transferred to the IT department. IT department tells me it's okay for it to make such noise and asks me to ask for a return from the store.

Rang the store and they put me to another department. I'm told that they will arrange a courier to take the laptop and INSPECT it. If it is faulty, they will FIX AND RETURN IT to me. If it is not faulty, they will STILL RETURN IT TO ME.

I don't want this laptop. I want to return it and get a refund as the screen is too small. I'm still in the 14 day return period. 

I asked if I can be refunded or can I get a credit refund so I can purchase a better laptop in January and was told that it is not possible. The reason is BECAUSE I USED THE LAPTOP. I TURNED IT ON therefore I don't qualify for a refund. 

How else am I supposed to know if the laptop works at all if I can't even turn it on? I'm told they won't accept a refund as I used it. (I think they have never heard of a factory default)

I'm just a 20 year old uni student trying to get a laptop for my coursework. It is a 11.7 inch and I have found it to be too small.

I last talked to them almost 1 hour ago and was told that I will be emailed a return form and if the laptop does not have a fault, it will be returned back to me.

Here is a screenshot of their return policy. http://imgur.com/PFKpwAs

In Season 4's episode, ""Silence in the Library,"" we find 10 and Donna investigating The Library for, what they later learn are, the Vashta Nerada. 

Prof. Song shows up with her team, and eventually one of her companions, Miss Evangelista, wanders off and is consumed by the Vashta Nerada. Doctor and company watch as Miss Evangelista begins data ghosting. At first, the remnant of Evangelista's consciousness talks about and to 'the nice woman' (Donna). As the ghost loses connection with reality, however, it says something about ""Ice Cream"" and then the connection is lost, leaving the words ""Ice Cream"" to be repeated several times. 

Now this could be as simple as bad timing, and that word is repeated, almost as a glitch as the energy fades. I think it's far more important of a moment than that, however. This is such a sad moment in the episode, that throwing ""Ice Cream"" out there at the worst possible time is almost inappropriate, especially since they had not been talking about anything to do with ice cream previously, so it could have been any word. But it's ""Ice Cream"". So, what I believe happened, is just as the data ghost was fading, Miss Angelista's consciousness was aware enough to know that she had to get some message to the group, because in a moment, she would be completely gone. In her realization that she was already dead, she tells them, ""I scream."" Over and over again, to warn them.

Hope you don't mind me posting this here.

I have an idea to challenge the FB real name policy.

Under the Equality Act 2010 it illegal to discriminate in the provision of a service. Discrimination is classed as either direct (think the B&amp;B with the No Gays policy) or indirect. Indirect discrimination is when a policy or procedure disproportionately affects one group of people (a group defined by a protected characteristic - sex, race, religion, age, sexuality or disability).
I have a hunch that a significantly more women use a fake name on FB than men, for reasons such as avoiding violent ex-partners. I also believe that significantly more trans people use a 'fake' name than straight, 'traditional' gender folks. It's also probably true across the LGBT community,  as sadly this world is far from a perfect place.

The plan is in the first instance to submit a complaint to Facebook, with evidence, asking them to rescind this policy (in the UK at least). Should that fail (as it likely will), I will take the evidence and seek support from other groups to mount a legal challenge.

In order to do this we need evidence to back up the hypothesis. If you could take a couple of minutes to fill out this simple survey that would be a massive help. Please feel free to spread the survey far and wide. It needs responses from those with 'fake' names and 'real' names to be valid. I'll also be searching for academic papers that have looked at this issue, if anyone is aware of any research already done in this area please let me know.

Cheers

Brand new in box Laptop - HP ProBook 430 G1, i5 4200U, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, Windows 7/8 Pro. Perfect for Christmas! 

This is a brand new laptop I've received but surplus to requirements. I got this for my gf's christmas, but she's just got a new one from work and because i opened the box up to make sure it was OK, the seller won't take it back. I paid £550 for it, and so I'm just looking to get most of my money back. Still packaged, seals not broken inside and comes with an additional 4GB of RAM (taking it to 8GB in total), which I can install if you want or just leave it, unopened in the box! Windows 7 Pro on it at the moment, but has the rights to upgrade to Win8Pro if you want.

This has a 14"" screen and is very light and stylish. I've got a few pics of the actual laptop and a few stock pics so you can see what it looks like - just didn't want to open the seal on the bag, but you can see how thin it is!

I disliked quite a few of his stories and liked quite a bit of his stories. I prefer RTD myself, I really liked his writing. That said though. Series 8 has to be one of the best seasons in my honest opinion. I reallllly like Capaldi's Doctor and his acting. He's just fantastic. I liked watching The Doctor get back on his feet after Trenzalore (Deep Breath) and I liked him even more in Flatline (The speech at the end is top notch)

That said. There was a few problems in Series 8. I didn't really like the end of Listen. I feel that they shouldn't have made Clara apparently play such a larger role in The Doctor's life (i.e. His Childhood) but that's just my own opinion. I did like the rest of the episode though. I didn't like the ending of Kill The Moon. I felt The Doctor was in the right by backing away from the decision and I felt Clara's reaction was unjust.
I did like In the Forest of The Night but I can't get over the fact that Danny scared a tiger away with a flashlight, Just seems a little farfetched for me.

But I will give credit where credit is due. I LOVED every episode of this Series even with some flaws. Deep Breath was an explosive return and I loved the reference to The Girl in the Fireplace. I loved Time Heist because of the Heisty Ocean's Eleven feel of it. I liked Flatline because it was a clever and new idea (at least for me I didn't watch Classic Who that much I'm still playing Catch up with it) and the two-part finale in my opinion has to be one of the best Series (Season) finales Doctor Who has had since it came back. It tugged at my heart strings, made me laugh, and made me cry with The Doctor when He finds out Missy told a white lie and that Gallifrey isn't there. The Doctor punching the TARDIS console is such a powerful scene. I also LOVED the tribute to the Brigadier and The Doctor finally getting his answer to ""Am I a Good Man?""

All in All, While I'm not a big Moffat person I did like this Series better than I did Series 5, 6, and 7. (I liked Series 7 Part 2) and I feel Capaldi is a fantastic Doctor. I'm not a Moffat Lover by any means and I've disagreed with a lot of the stuff he's written. But to anyone out there who disrespects the opinions of others because they like one writer better than the other, I feel you should stop and just enjoy the ride :)

I'd also like to hear all of your guys thoughts and opinions too. Everyone opinion matters and I love hearing them :)

Edit: Hot fiddly fam am I a pudding brain. I completely overlooked The Caretaker. I also thoroughly enjoyed that episode too. The Doctor thinking Clara was dating the guy with the bowtie and that he reminded The Doctor of his younger self. The Doctor going undercover, and the reference to River Song were nice too.

Edit 2: I forgot to mention I will be catching up on the Classic series along with finishing up my rewatch of Matt Smith before the premiere of Series 9. I'm also loving all of the opinions so far. I'm happy we're having a pretty good discussion about Series 8 as a whole and sharing our thoughts on it.

I don't feel sad constantly or suicidal, but I just don't really feel much interest in doing anything other than distracting myself online and smoking cigarettes and drinking caffeine. I kinda convince myself I'm just lazy, introverted ect but deep down have a feeling I'm destined for great things once I pull myself together.

Two weeks to dwell on the worst Leicester football in years!

&gt; The final international break of 2014 begins this week, as Barclays Premier League football pauses for a fortnight ahead of Leicester City’s visit of Sunderland on 22 November.
There will be Foxes players involved in international matches on three different continents, starting on Thursday when **Liam Moore** will be hoping to continue his excellent form with England Under-21s. 

&gt;Gareth Southgate’s side begin their preparations for next summer’s Under-21 European Championships with an international against Portugal at Turf Moor on Thursday, before travelling to Brest to take on France next Monday. 

&gt;**Chris Wood**’s New Zealand face a double-header in the Far East, starting with a game against China in Nanchang on Friday. The All Whites then travel to Bangkok to take on Thailand, where there is likely to be huge interest in the City striker due to the Foxes’ connections in the Kingdom. **Chris** will also captain the team.

&gt;**Kasper Schmeichel** and Denmark also face two away games during the break. Leaders of a very tight Group I in qualification for the 2016 European Championships, Morten Olsen’s men head to Serbia for their latest qualifier on Friday, before a friendly international with Romania in Bucharest next Tuesday. 


&gt;Academy representation on the international stage begins on Friday night, when Under-18 captain **Ben Chilwell** will be part of the England Under-19 squad that hosts Italy at Rotherham United’s New York Stadium. It continues on Saturday when young striker **Simonas Stankevicius** will be in the Lithuania senior squad for their European Championship Group E qualifier against Switzerland in St. Gallen. Lithuania then head to Kiev to face Ukraine in a friendly next Tuesday. 

&gt;Saturday will see City focus switch to Africa Cup of Nations qualification, with Jeff **Schlupp**, **Alie Sesay** and **Riyad Mahrez** all potentially in action. 

&gt; **Schlupp**’s Ghana, leading Group E with two games to play and needing just one more win to secure qualification, travel to Kampala to face Uganda on Saturday, before hosting Togo in Kumasi on Wednesday. 

&gt;**Mahrez** and Algeria have already qualified for the finals with four wins out of four and need just a point to win Group B. They host Ethiopia in Blida on Saturday, before travelling to Bamako to play Mali next Wednesday. 

&gt;Meanwhile **Sesay**, a regular with the Foxes Under-21s, reports for duty with Sierra Leone for the second time when they play the Ivory Coast in Abidjan on Saturday. Sierra Leone must win to keep their slim hopes of qualification intact, before they take on Congo in Lubumbashi next Wednesday.

&gt;Sunday sees Wales travel to Brussels for a massive game against Belgium in European Championship qualifying and, while **Andy King** will be missing through suspension, young striker **Tom Lawrence** will be involved. 

&gt;Wales currently lead Group B with seven points from three games and a positive result against one of the group favourites would seriously boost their hopes of reaching the finals in France. 

&gt;Foxes international interest will continue after the international break, with schoolboy **Layton Ndukwu** set to report for England Under-17s for three Nike International Friendlies in the United States. 

&gt;**Layton**, who scored a hat-trick against Cyprus on his last outing or England Under-17s, will be part of a squad that takes on the United States, Brazil and Australia in Florida between 22 November and 4 December.

We are quite conservative with our energy usage and never use heating however we do not use gas so boiler and oven is electricity operated. Is electricity siphoning likely the case?

Maybe it was the consistent CL football, or maybe I loved how drilled out team was as a unit, both in defence and attack. I just loved seeing us being really hard to score against, loved seeing Pepe winning the golden glove, I can't really explain it. This Season has been a disaster, I know we lost arguably the best centre forward in the world, but there's something about this season that's really put me off Rodgers and our whole team. We seem soft, too nice, and comfortable for other teams to bully us. It would have never happened under Benitez, not just because of the personnel but because our players were well drilled, defensive errors rarely happened, and after the CL winning season, we mostly always have teams with more financial muscle a match and won a lot of them. I'm sorry if I hurt any passionate fans of Rodgers philosophy, but to be fair, Tiki Taka only works when our whole team is in sync and know they're roles. Sorry for the rant and nostalgia but I've seen rafa mentioned a few times on this sub and its brought back memories.

I hit a period in my life where I stopped following the Saints, it was after we lost FA cup final in 2002. I was around 9/10 and for whatever reason i stopped going along with my dad on the weekend and generally just remember losing interest in football for a while. (I think even at that age i ould tell we should have won the final) For anyone whos interested i picked up my support again the first season of Championship football. Anyway my question is what the hell happened to our squad from the final at the Millenium stadium. In particular i'm interested in Fabrice Fernandes, he was my favourite player growing up, with his iconic black gloves, regardless of the time of year. Anyway any long standing fans know where all those great players went - Svenson Bro's (saw Anders in th 2012 euros!), Oakley, Lundekvam, Omerod???

The NHS is currently facing a funding gap of around with many figures bandied around I'm not quite sure how much it is but its anywhere upwards of a couple of billion pounds a year. Meanwhile, the population is aging meaning more frail people and less people to pay taxes to support the NHS.
And at the same time we face an obesity epidemic as people eat too much and exercise too little putting even more strain on NHS resources.

So I'm now not sure how the NHS can survive. I agree there should be a healthcare system that is efficient and acts as a safety net to anyone who gets ill but I'm not quite sure why everyone is so anti-privatisation of the NHS. People point to the US where healthcare costs have spiralled in recent times (you can argue to what extent this is caused by lobbyists separately) but then at the same time many countries across the developed world have and insurance based healthcare system. At the same time, private health insurance is provided as a benefit by some companies because its quicker to pay privately and get things done and people back to work rather than wait for an NHS appointment.

Change My View: The NHS should become an insurance based system similar to other developed nations.

I promise I'm not in the habit of talking to strangers on buses, but you know when you sometimes see someone and you think ""I'll regret it if I don't try and talk to this person"".

So, here's the brief version of the events: she was kind enough to give me directions to where I was heading etc. and we briefly talked about talking to strangers on buses and how it sometimes leads to pleasant conversation, and frankly I would have liked to talk to her a bit more, but I pussied out half way through and I didn't ask her name or anything. I was going to, but by the time I found the courage (By mentally reciting Yoda quotes in my head), she turned around and said ""bye"" and got off around Filton Avenue. I didn't react in time because I forgot how to English.

Anyway. What I'm trying to say is, I'd like to find this said stranger and a. thank her for the helpful directions, b. apologise for pussying out, and c. get to know her name and get to know her a bit more.

My question is, how do you go about finding someone you know very little about, in Bristol, without ending up on some restraining order/watch-list?

You need not tell me how creepy this is. **I know.** But I promise my intentions are benign.

All I know about this person:

- Was in town 14/11/14 up until around 5 ish PM

- Lives on/around Filton Avenue.

- Blonde. Shoulder length ish hair.

- Has an iPhone, with a red case. And a smashing Spotify playlist.

- Not sure of the top, because it was obscured by jacket, but definitely jeans and slip-on purple shoes.

The only counterexample I can think of is The Simpsons, but I think everybody can agree that we want Doctor Who to end before its quality descends into some of what we've seen in recent Simpsons years.

So how do people think Doctor Who will end? My favorite idea is that the end of the show will somehow include a redemption of The Master, and possibly more generally all of the Time Lords.

A couple of months ago I moved house to get closer to my work, but in the process lost the use of a garage and secure compound to park my bikes in.

Since moving I've been on the lookout for one to rent nearby to keep my babies safe (one is currently in my brothers garden and my main bikes sits outside the house :( ).. I recently found one but phoned about 3 hours after it had been let out, on my lunch break at work.

Does anyone have experiencing renting garages separately from their accommodation? Are there any hidden jewels of websites that will make this easier? Or, even better, is there anyone within Birmingham with spare space in their garage for 2 bikes and my collection of tools?

Getting a bit desperate really, not much a fan of leaving my baby outside :(

You might ask why I have nothing better to do on a Friday night than seek out some new friends, but you know, therein lies part of the reason for making this post. 

I've been thinking of doing this for a little while and I hope it's not unwelcome, I'm just hoping to meet a few new people as my social life is somewhat... lacking? And ultimately that's something I want to change.

A little **about me**.

I'm a girl approaching her mid-twenties, but I'm very young at heart. After moving here from Wales and studying in Canterbury (UKC, Philosophy), I stayed around in the area to live and work. The great friends I made have for the most part moved away to continue on with their lives elsewhere, and while we do keep in touch, it's not the same as having the kind of people around who you can text and say ""Hey I fancy a drink, Spoons?"". I'd hoped to make some such friends through work, but unfortunately for various reasons that hasn't happened.

I live a little outside of Canterbury with my boyfriend, and honestly, I don't spend nearly as much time in the city as I'd like to any more! My life has become a nine to five at an office job that is *okay*, and my evenings and weekends are pretty quiet. I have hobbies and interests, but they're mostly indoor related. I love video games, playing MtG (Magic the Gathering), marathon watching 90s shows with my boyfriend, reading some and writing as much as I can. I guess that's not a massive list of things to define a person, I'm interested in much more than that, but those are the core ways I spend my time. 

I'm a really social person, but I'm also really shy (prone to awkwardness when nervous!) so it can take people a while to get to know me, I guess? I'm intending on staying in Canterbury for the forseeable future, and I'd like to meet some new folks. The ways I have tried so far, such as the university socials, haven't been that successful for me either: most of the people I've met there are still students, and we don't end up with a whole lot in common, which makes conversation-starters difficult.

I'm a very genuine person: what you see is what you get. In some ways I am your classic girl in that I love Disney movies and chocolate, but my tastes vary into psychological thriller type movies as well. The types of TV shows I really enjoy are Buffy, House, Castle, The Killing and Doctor Who. For music I pretty much like everything except for hip hop, death metal, rap (not against it, just not my thing!). I occasionally like to indulge in terrible 90s music because nostalgia FTW.

I am interested in politics (healthy debates as well as simple opinion sharing), I like to listen and help people, I am fairly down to earth. Sometimes I think about things too much and worry too much, but you know, that's not so bad.

**What I'm looking for** is/are a few new people to get to know, really. I'd prefer similar-ish age / life experience but you know at this point, whatever goes, really. If what you've read so far has piqued your interest then please feel free to comment or PM me and we can maybe have a chat some time. I have a Skype account I'm more than willing to share for this purpose to get to know anyone a bit better. 

So yeah. I look forward to hearing from you and I hope this post isn't a huge pile of lames :)

But it's an international break and we've been talking a lot about transfers, so I had to investigate.*

A claim that I've seen repeated over and over around these parts is that we should sign (or should *have* signed) players from the Premier League rather than from foreign leagues. The assumption is that they're used to the pace of the game, the opposition, the culture, English language, whatever - so they're a good bet to retain their form, whereas foreign players take time to adjust, at best, and at worst straight up bomb.

Let's take a look at that claim, shall we?

According to Transfermarkt, here are the top 5 foreign transfers to the PL in the past 5 years:

* **Ángel Di María**
* **Mesut Özil**
* **Sergio Agüero**
* **Alexis Sánchez**
* **Eliaquim Mangala**

Not a bad bunch, eh? 3 are undeniable stars, one (Özil) had a killer immediate impact but tapered off a bit, and the last (Mangala) is the one who's had a shaky first few months of English life.

Now let's look at the top 5 from the Prem:

* **Fernando Torres**
* **Juan Mata**
* **Andy Carroll**
* **Luke Shaw**
* **Romelu Lukaku** ^(*- Lukaku is iffy, because Everton had a trial period with him on loan. He's here in the interest of fairness, but it's clear that the deal happened precisely because they already knew he'd fit in*)
* ^(*If you do discount Lukaku*) **Marouane Fellaini**

Huh. Interesting. Famous flop; Slight flop; Famous flop (well, famous overpay); Flop who might yet develop in time; Good player - but wait, you read the side note, right?; And another big flop to top it off.

Wait, this is a fun game. Let's do the next five!

* **Adam Lallana** - Not living up to expectations
* **Robin Van Persie** - Hey! Finally a real hit!
* **Samir Nasri** - Also good. Was about to say lukewarm but he did have a great first couple seasons.
* **Dejan Lovren** - Not living up to expectations
* **Stewart Downing** (to Liverpool) - Didn't live up to expectations, sold for a quarter of the price.

From this sample, it looks like putting a lot of money down (over ~£18m) on a quality, Premiership-proven player isn't just a coinflip - *it's a good bet that they'll underperform*. There are only two players in that category from the past 5 years who have gone on to justify that price tag.

The website said everything was fine, and I was even refunded some money I had apparently overpaid.

However, today out of the blue I got a letter from HMRC saying I owed them my class 2 NIC contributions. As in, *all of them*. I really thought that had been taken care of, and they had never told me otherwise (neither by letter nor by any alert on the website), but apparently I was wrong. Since it was not that much money anyway, and I rather I didn't owe any taxes again, I hurried to the bank and transferred it.

But here's the funny part. On the way back from the bank I realized something: the amount I just paid is **almost exactly** the same I was refunded this summer. The difference is less than 2 quid, out of several hundred pounds. And I don't believe in coincidences, so now I have the horrible suspicion I was refunded money incorrectly in the first place, then some time later my account was reviewed (there was another letter on the envelope informing about proposed changes on how NICs are paid, so they might be checking on everybody), they didn't find my contributions, and I ended up with this vaguely threatening letter telling me I never paid a thing.

By the way, while I was writing this post I realized the letter is dated more than a month ago, but just got it today.

So I have two questions. First, is this kind of thing normal? I expected the HMRC to be cold and efficient, but this looks kind of seedy. And second, how can I find out what has actually happened? I was thinking of writing them a letter but I don't know if I will ever get a straight answer, and I hate calling the helpline (I have yet to find operators with worse accents or harder hearing). Any suggestions?

The website said everything was fine, and I was even refunded some money I had apparently overpaid.

However, today out of the blue I got a letter from HMRC saying I owed them my class 2 NIC contributions. As in, *all of them*. I really thought that had been taken care of, and they had never told me otherwise (neither by letter nor by any alert on the website), but apparently I was wrong. Since it was not that much money anyway, and I rather I didn't owe any taxes again, I hurried to the bank and transferred it.

But here's the funny part. On the way back from the bank I realized something: the amount I just paid is **almost exactly the same** I was refunded this summer. The difference is less than 2 quid, out of several hundred pounds. And I don't believe in coincidences, so now I have the horrible suspicion I was refunded money incorrectly in the first place, then some time later my account was reviewed (there was another letter on the envelope informing about proposed changes on how NICs are paid, so they might be checking on everybody), they didn't find my contributions, and I ended up with this vaguely threatening letter telling me I never paid a thing.

By the way, while I was writing this post I realized the letter is dated more than a month ago, but just got it today.

So I have two questions. First, is this kind of thing normal? I expected the HMRC to be cold and efficient, but this looks kind of seedy. And second, how can I find out what has actually happened? I was thinking of writing them a letter but I don't know if I will ever get a straight answer, and I hate calling the helpline (I have yet to find operators with worse accents or harder hearing). Any suggestions?

The website said everything was fine, and I was even refunded some money I had apparently overpaid.

However, today out of the blue I got a letter from HMRC saying I owed them my class 2 NIC contributions. As in, *all of them*. I really thought that had been taken care of, and they had never told me otherwise (neither by letter nor by any alert on the website), but apparently I was wrong. Since it was not that much money anyway, and I rather I didn't owe any taxes again, I hurried to the bank and transferred it.

But here's the funny part. On the way back from the bank I realized something: the amount I just paid is **almost exactly the same** I was refunded this summer. The difference is less than 2 quid, out of several hundred pounds. And I don't believe in coincidences, so now I have the horrible suspicion I was refunded money incorrectly in the first place, then some time later my account was reviewed (there was another letter on the envelope informing about proposed changes on how NICs are paid, so they might be checking on everybody), they didn't find my contributions, and I ended up with this vaguely threatening letter telling me I never paid a thing.

By the way, while I was writing this post I realized the letter is dated more than a month ago, but just got it today.

So I have two questions. First, is this kind of thing normal? I expected the HMRC to be cold and efficient, but this looks kind of seedy. And second, how can I find out what has actually happened? I was thinking of writing them a letter but I don't know if I will ever get a straight answer, and I hate calling the helpline (I have yet to find operators with worse accents or harder hearing). Any suggestions?

I have a car, but it's a gas guzzler and I am terrified of the idea of being stuck in traffic like all those people I usually whiz past in a morning. Parking at work is also a total pain.

The lady that took gave me my crime number told me that Cambridge Police sell off unclaimed recovered bikes on a website that she called ""Hyperion"", but my Google-fu has failed me. Do any of you guys know what she was referring to?

So basically I want to ask about sun screen/cream and night moisturisers. 

I moved to the UK not too long ago and recently ran out of my usual 'night moisturiser' (Neutrogena's Hydroboost) and I can't really find it here in the UK so I am thinking about trying something new! I also went to boots and got myself a Boots card and Eucerin's DermoPurifyer moisturiser and I love it! It's really helping my skin but I plan to use it only for morning wear. 


Another thing is Sunscreen! I've never gotten into the habit of wearing it and I am quite lazy so I always use my étude house CC cream/baby choux base (30++SPF?) as my 'sunscreen'. However I want to have more benefits to my sunscreen as I feel like lately my skin hasn't been really good and I'd like to treat it better, and I also want A+ skin in the future haha. 


anyway in summary, any product recommendations for a *night moisturiser* and *sun screen*? or advice/ tips etc


Skin: Combination skin? I tend to break out easily on the cheeks everywhere else not too badly but it happens. 

Budget: Not too expensive because I am an international student and groceries aren't cheap :(.

Theres no real sense of community out here, and the sports teams.... Everywheres so spread out that people in Saskatchewan (a 650,000km square area) will support teams from thousands of kilometers away as if they've lived there all their lives since we don't really have any teams here other than a fairly shit football team.

It's just a completely different way of thinking here. You can't go anywhere because public transport in almost non existent and 6/7 months of the year you're driving on ice and 2ft of snow.  Right now I drive 9 hours to get to the city i work in. drive 2 hours to work everyday, then drive 9 hours back home and stay there for a week. I'm a bit tired of the -45C weather too.

What I want to know is how expensive is it to live in Liverpool? I'm only 19 and my parents will be staying in Canada. But I do have most of my family here so i'm sure I could mooch for a bit.

So therefore I'm making a list of things to pick up on my travels home over the christmas season: 

Superdrug
-MUA lipstick £1 (raven, scarlet siren, 13, nectar)
-Barry M lip liner (plum)
-Rimmel lipstick (kate matte kiss of life 111)
-NYX lip cream (amsterdam)
-MUA conceal palette
-MUA matte perfect loose translucent powder
-MUA eye primer

Paks
-Doris michaels (LP08)
-Sleek brow kit (extra dark/black)
-Sleek pout paint (cloud 9, peek-a-bloo)

Boots
-Lipcote matte lipstick sealer
-Burts bees lip crayon (napa vineyard)

Debenhams
-smashbox photofinish primer (green)
-Lancôme tient idole 24h

Feel free to tell me to add/swap out anything on my list if you know of a better purchase! I don't wear eyeshadow or blush ever though. 

So far this is all I've got, I'm particularly looking for dupes for NYX lip creams Copenhagen and Transylvania. (Maybe a MUA velvet lip lacquer or bourjois velvet lipstick?)

I'm really looking for recommendations on eyeliner for everyday cat eyes, concealers that aren't super cakey, and mascara (oh god i suck at choosing mascara...)

I'm in need of either a 
-good cake eyeliner or 
-long lasting (no smudging!) gel/liquid eyeliner i would guess. 
Will pay up to about £15.

-A good, waterproof mascara. 
Preferably not clumpy, racoony or flaky, up to £15.  

-Highlighter/concealer! 
Every time i buy one its really tacky, orange and heavy. I just have dark circles is all... Not really super necessary so maybe up to about £10.

-Powder! 
I'm totally clueless in this regard and need a powder to reduce shine since I'm fairly oily. However, most powders I've used have made me 
A) even more shiny after less than an hour.
B) break out.  (NO.)
I need something that mattifies and *keeps it that way for more than 15 minutes*. 
Will pay extortionate amounts for something that works goddamnit!

My course (BA Linguistics) accepts around 35 out of 130+ applicants per year. How many of those total applicants do you think would have also been invited to interview? Now that I've been invited, is there some way of predicting my chances (other than 35/130 = apprx. 1/4 chance) of being accepted?

ALSO do you have any tips for the interview process? Any feedback/tips will be extremely appreciated.

Labour voters tend to think that UKIP are big, bad and evil. That their policies and ideas are absurd and that Labour will put right all of the wrongs in the world. Last weekend, the hashtag #WeBackEd was trending for longer than anything related to Remembrance Day. 

So why doesn't Miliband come out and say 'Look, we all know UKIP are not the right choice to lead Britain. Their policies are terrible and they are nothing more than a protest vote and to prove this, I am officially announcing that I would like to have a 1 to 1 debate with Nigel Farage so I can demonstrate to the rest of our country just how bad he and his party are.'

Some episodes have been up there with greats, some have been astonishingly bad.

Here's what I think the issue is:

Before it even began, we were told ""Series 8 will be darker"". 
It has but it also hasn't. I'm aware Doctor Who is fundamentally a childrens' program but in my opinion it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be dark or childish.

For example: In the Forest of the Night/The Caretaker in comparison to Dark Water/Listen.  It's almost like watching two different shows.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed Series 8, but I think Series 9 would be a lot better if the writers stick to one theme whether it's dark/childish or whatever.

There isn't going to be a TLDR as I think its all important information that cigar smokers that live in the UK need to know.  

Where to start, how about the beginning of a future aficionado's cigar habit;

**Should I smoke cigars?**

That's completely up to you as an individual.  The health risks of smoking cigars are still being looked into.  Studies that I have read suggest that the risks of getting cancer from any form of cigar smoking is very minimal.  Please note, that does not say that you are risk free - just that if you smoke less that 5 cigars a day your chances of mouth or lung cancer are small.  If you pair that cigar with alcohol, and not just a drink but a few, it **allegedly** increases.  Second had smoke is still a cause for concern so don't smoke around infants or pregnant ladies.  This is a gentleman's hobby after all!

This is an expensive hobby, much more so in this country than in others.  If you live in Europe with a lower tax on nicotine or in the states where it is a lot lower, not to mention the fact that less shipping is involved you could smoke a decent cigar a day every day o the week for less than $40, or around £25.  Obviously I'm not talking about smoking the best of the best here but a good quality hand rolled cigar.  In the UK, it can be hard for anyone to find a cigar that they would consider good (please note this is subjective and I believe all cigar smokers to be occasionally victim to cigar snobbery ha ha) for less than about £15.  That means that if you want to be a daily smoker, you're looking at spending about 4 times as much as someone that smokes in the US.  Its a hobby that makes you literally set fire to money.  There are also costs that are not immediately apparent with smoking cigars as well.  Storage can vary from a tupperdor with a humidification device such as a Boveda pack (more on these later on) that will cost around £10 total to set up and will be good for a long time, to a desktop humidor, or cabinet humidor that can reach into the thousands of pounds.  Add in cutters, lighters, hygrometers (the single most important tool in the cigar aficionado's arsenal), butane gas, matches and spares of the above and the costs escalate quickly.  So can you afford to smoke?

This **can** be addictive.  At the end of the day cigars contain nicotine which is a drug and has been proven to be addictive.  Think cigarettes contain a lot of nicotine? The average cigar contains 10 to 20 times the amount of nicotine that a single cigarette has.  Now, for a large majority of people that smoke cigars this is not the case.  If however you have an addictive personality its just another point to bear in mind.

**So now I want to smoke cigars, where do I buy them?**

For a lot of people, they will head over to their local B&amp;M (Brick and Mortar store, meaning a physical store rather than a web based store) and hand over a lot of cash for a cigar or 2.  I still do this and have been buying cigars virtually for a while now.  I would just like to point out that it is important to help support these stores by giving them your business occasionally, without customers they will die out.  Now, a lot of the stores around me are filled with people that know less about cigars than I do and so I am hesitant to buy a lot from them because I'm worried about the proper storage of them while they are in the premises.  One store near me has 2 humidor cabinets, only one of them has a working hygrometer so I have no idea what Relative Humidity (RH for short) they keep their cigars at.  The bigger problem is that neither do they.  This can mean that the cigars get either too wet and have problems with the draw of the cigar, or worse that they become too dry and crack and break upon lighting them.  So in short, when you buy a cigar in a shop, inspect the shop.  If you have questions ask them and if you don't like the answers either say something or vote with your wallet.  

Most shops will over humidify their cigars a little.  This is because their humidor will be opened many many times a day by people wanting to buy the cigars inside.  If they kept all their cigars at exactly 62% opening the door once maybe twice a day wouldn't make an impact on that as long as you didn't leave it open.  Opening it several times in the space of an hour will have a huge impact on the health of the cigars contained within.  Because of this its far more common for shops to keep their cigars contained in their humidor at about 70% RH.  There is nothing wrong with this at all, but if you prefer your cigars on the dryer side just bear on mind that you will need to let this happen yourself before you smoke the cigar to get the best experience out of it **for you**.

If you choose to purchase your cigars online, you have all the above problems associated with your cigars.  You also have the problem that they have traveled, sometimes without anything additional in the box to help them keep their humidity, and have been exposed to a wide range of temperatures during that journey.  Temperature is important when storing cigars and I will get to that later on.  Therefore when you accept delivery of cigars it is important to let them rest.  Resting and aging are 2 different things and unless you are planning on building a large collection of cigars I wouldn't worry about the latter, but resting is a period of up to a year.  Personally I like to rest cigars that have traveled a minimum of 2 weeks for each week that they spent in transit.  Less if they have only traveled domestically, and I know the RH and temperature of where they were originally stored.  If its a cigar that is very difficult to obtain, is expensive or is for a special occasion I will stretch that to a month per week traveled.  I want to point out that it is not necessary to do this, but I have noticed a difference in flavour, burn, smoke output and because of all these things, enjoyment, out of a cigar that I have allowed proper rest.  I have cigars here that I will not smoke more of at the moment as in about 3-6 months they will reach the point where I want to smoke them.  They are good now, but will be a lot better later on.  This is something that each person has to discover for themselves as it (and so much of cigar smoking) is subjective.  

Despite the waiting time of delivery and the added wait time of resting or even aging cigars many people buy them online because they cost significantly less.  Even in the UK you can save money by shopping online.  For example, a Montecristo Number 2 bought at JJFox.co.uk will cost you £17.50 at the time of writing this.  To buy it in their B&amp;M on St James St. London, will cost you £22.50.  This adds £5 to the cost of each cigar because of the associated costs involved with running a physical store, power, staff, rent and rates etc.  For the consumer it basically boils down to, buy 3 in the store and you could have bought 4 online.  If you move out of the UK for your purchasing the savings become even more. The cigarworld.de store for instance is based in Germany, and a single #2 from there will cost you €15.60 (excluding shipping) or £12.47.  That's nearly half the price of buying them in the UK at a B&amp;M.  If you go further afield to somewhere like ihavannas.com or cigarsofhabanos.com you can buy a full box of 10 of them for $102 (including shipping) which comes to £65.09.  So at that price if you buy 3 of these cigars at a B&amp;M in the UK, it would cost you £67.50, whereas you could buy a box of them online for a little less.

You have to also calculate shipping costs when doing this.  There are a few retailers that will ship to the UK from the USA, and their shipping varies wildly.  For 5 cigars from www.smallbatchcigar.com the shipping is $18 (£11.49), for 5 cigars from www.atlanticcigar.com the shipping is $45.68 (£29.15).  So if you're planning on making an online order it may very well be beneficial to either advertise the fact on /r/ukcigars to share the postage costs across several people or to make a larger order splitting the cost across a number of cigars.

Postage in Europe is usually a lot less expensive.  Top25cigars.co.uk who are based in Poland have good prices and a good range of single cigars and the added advantage that if you spend over €30/£30 your postage is free using their ""second class"" postage system.  It has been my experience that ordering cigars from them and paying the £4 surcharge for UPS to handle the package takes just as long as this free postage so you can guess what system I use.  Germany's cigarworld.de has a higher postage cost that goes from about €4 for a single cigar to about €20 for a few more but does get to you extremely fast in my opinion, usually around 3 days.

Postage is not the only cost of bringing in cigars to the UK.  Legally you have to pay VAT and import duties on cigars brought into the country.  Whether you do this or not is up to you, but note that it is a criminal offense to smuggle tobacco into the country and you will be fined if caught doing it.  PM me for details on the fines and any other questions that you may have about the costs of import as I am not willing to discuss them here, but they may not be as much as you think they are.  **PM me for details.**

**So I've bought my cigars, how do I store them?**

There are many many options for storage and I could write pages on each way but in short it comes down to this; do you want something that looks nice, or something that works well?  Do you have a huge budget for storage, or a small one?  Do you have a lot of space or not?

Firstly what do you really need a humidor of any type to do?  It has to hold humidity at a constant RH, be stable and solid and have room for your cigars.  It should also have room for sufficient humidification and a hygrometer to measure that humidification.  I cannot stress enough the importance of proper humidification or measurement of that RH.  The only method of humidification that I **personally** will endorse for a smaller humidor of any type are water pillows, specifically, those made by a company called Boveda.  Boveda packs are 2 way humidity control.  This means that if there is not enough humidity in the air they will release water to give the RH that you want.  Conversely if there is too much they will absorb humidity again giving you the RH that you desire.  They are available from amazon.co.uk for around £5 each and come in RH's of 62-72% and you will need 1 for each humidor and another for each 25 cigars inside.  For those of you that are after larger cabinet style humidors there are active humidification systems that will monitor humidity and release vapor to bring you to your target RH or there are 2 way systems that can be achieved using molecular sieves - most commonly used in cat litter (no I'm not kidding at all I know a guy that has 3 wine coolers full of cigars who really knows his stuff and he uses a silica based kitty litter to control humidity).

For measurement you **need** a hygrometer.  It measures the RH of the air around it and they don't cost the earth either.  I have 3 Hygroset II hygrometers and while they are a pain to initially calibrate they **will** save you money in the long run because your cigars will stay in good condition if you read them and act accordingly.  You can buy these for around £15 not including shipping from amazon.co.uk.  Another notable brand is Xikar, all of their products come with a **lifetime** warranty but are a little more expensive due to this.

But what humidor should I have?  Lets split the options up by cost and functionality.

**Tupperdor**

The cheapest way to effectively store cigars.  Almost any supermarket will have Tupperware containers that are airtight, watertight and hardy.  You should look for ones with the locking sides and a good rubber seal.  Including the cost of a couple of boveda's and a hygrometer you can be set up for about £30 and never need to buy another one as long as you don't get too many cigars.  The vast majority of cigar smokers use these as they are cheap, easy to set up (just wash with a little lemon juice and water or bicarbonate of soda and water to remove any plastic smell), durable and effective.  I have 4 of them.

**Wooden Humidor**

These range from cheap to ""I need a raise"".  The one that I have cost me 30 Cuban peso's from a street market in Havana but you can spent literally thousands on them.  They look impressive, smell great and are highly desirable.  Once you buy one they need to be seasoned (look for a guide on the web, this post is long enough already haha) before you can store cigars in them, a process that usually takes around 2 weeks.  The advantage of them is that they are almost always lined with Spanish cedar (which is neither Spanish or cedar ironically) and cigars will age (when stored for a couple of years) better in them.  You can still have this with a tupperdor by including some cigar box pieces in them.

**Coolerdor**

This is like a large tupperdor, made out of an insulated camping cooler, the sort of thing you take full of ice and beer when you go away for a few days.  They require a little more set up than a tupperdor, are a bit more expensive but will fit a lot more in and have room for full boxes as well.

**Wineador**

This is a converted wine cooler that has become a humidor.  They are not cheap (I got mine for about £145 delivered, but that's still a lot less than a lot of wooden humidors) require a lot of setting up if you want to create a humidity controlled environment and are not for the faint of heart.  They are a significant investment into the hobby of cigar smoking.  Once bought and seasoned to hold the RH you want they are the best thing to store cigars in as they are temperature controlled as well as humidity controlled.  I will make a separate post about setting one up.

Temperature is important when storing cigars.  It helps to protect the natural oils that make up a lot of the flavour of cigars as well as stop problems with cigar beetle's.  These little shits will literally eat your cigars.  Try not to store cigars at temperatures over 22 degrees centigrade to **minimize** this risk.

**Quarantining Cigars**

I keep my cigars well humidified, and now at a temperature that should stop beetle problem's but the person that has just sent you some may not.  I advise **everyone** to invest in a tupperdor to keep any and all cigars that they have been sent in from anywhere - whether it be a B&amp;M, online shop, or from a friend on here.  Keep them in ziplock bags (available from any supermarket) with a small boveda (packs of I think 8 are available from amazon for £8-£10) in separate batches.  The cigars one person sent you may be fine and you don't want to contaminate them with another batch that you received that aren't.

This is not all you need to know but covers most things, shoot me a PM with any questions.

Wondering if anyone has any experience with the Sheriff courts as I have a couple of questions.

Back in January I was flashed by a speed camera doing about 40 in a 30 zone. I live in the north of Scotland and was driving down to England at this point for work - knowing I would not be home for at least 6 weeks I asked my flatmate to check all my mail and let me know if a FPN arrived. He claimed it had not and all was good.

I worked away from home for 6 weeks (without returning AT ALL on weekends) then went home, packed all my stuff up and moved in with my partner. I was pretty fastidious about changing my address on everything but, nonetheless, asked my old flatmate to let me know if I received any post. Spoke to him a couple of times over the last few months and he always told me there was nothing.

Fast forward to last night and he's round at mine for a few beers and he hands me a stack of unopened post telling me he had found it in 3rd flatmates room (all unopened.) Amongst all this post was a FPN for the original offence then a court summons for not paying it. I don't dispute the speeding ticket, I'll pay it and accept the points without question BUT I have a big problem. I'm going to America for a holiday on Thursday and assume there is now an arrest warrant out for me.

Thanks to anybody that has read this far, I have 3 questions.

1. when I turn myself in how quickly will I appear before a sheriff? i.e. if I go to a police station at 7 or 8 on Monday morning can I bank on the process being completed by Monday afternoon or am I looking at a night in custody?

2. I was caught speeding 100 miles from home - the summons is for the nearest court to that. Will the case have to be heard at that court or can it be moved to my home court?

3. Regardless of whether I spend time in custody can I bank on having this out of the way by Thursday morning if I turn myself in first thing on Monday?

So if we use the last episode as an example (though this can be extended to a select few as well), I was very much dissatisfied by the ending. Here's why: 

The Cybermen feel no empathy no love no remorse etc. Yet Danny Pink is able to, it doesn't make any sense. His emotional centers were turned off yet he still feels emotions, why? His love is so strong that it overrides the programming? That's pretty poor as it allows for obscure and almost ethereal plot loops to occur. If the ultimate victory of the doctor depends on something that intangible and poorly explained then I think we've got an issue here. Missy loses when Danny Pink takes control of the Cybermen, how? We don't know, but it serves the intended plot... 

The mummy episode was good because it featured the Doctor actually using his intelligence. The moon/egg episode was bad because it didn't involve him doing squat, he just sort of went 'not my problem'. I mean not counting the ridiculousness of the concept that the moon could be a giant space egg the episode didn't have a lot going for it. My point is that when the show uses the doctor as a logical instrument we see some really cool stuff happen, which is enjoyable because it can be fully understood and therefore appreciated by the viewer. Another example of an episode which delves too deeply into the abstract was s7 'The Rings of Akhaten'. Basically a giant parasitic planet which feeds on memories is killed by a leaf. A leaf which contains a powerful memory of Clara's parents meeting is somehow enough to destroy the magical planet. I use 'magical' because really that's how that episode felt, there wasn't much logic, the doctor didn't really have to use is brain once. 

Doctor who should be about season 5 episode 1, no screwdriver 20 minutes and no Tardis - but he owns it. That's what I think people like, or certainly what I like. But it's too much of a rare occasion for me, the episodes are dumbed down for kids or ruined by silly plot loops like 'love' winning against cold hard necessity.

No idea how to structure this post but have taken a look at a few others and will give it a go. If there is any information worth adding please just ask.

So as the title says 24 years old, receiving ~28k in salary and I have ~33k just sat in a low interest current account doing nothing. My regular monthly outgoings are ~7-800 incl rent, bills, food etc. which leaves me with maybe £800 per month after tax and outgoings have come out.

I also have ~33k sat in a standard Graduate HSBC account which is a combination of sort of inheritance and money I have saved up from my current job over the past couple of years.

I am currently renting as I had to relocate for my job and there is no guarantee of my location within the next few years. Due to this I wouldn't want to look into buying to live although I've considered buying to rent an option?

My main question really is what to do with the big lump sum sat in my account, I was thinking of moving to Santander 123 and moving my maximum amount into there. I also have heard about First Direct and being able to pay £150 into their savings account per month? I was thinking of having a filter through of Salary &gt; First Direct &gt; Santander with money moved into First Direct per month for saving and DD coming out of Santander.

I guess that's all I really have to say, I'd love some advice on where and how to go forward. Also as I mentioned at the start of my post I'm happy to answer any questions you may have :)

Thanks

Wasn't too sure where to ask this, but I figure you lot will be the best help.

Every year we have a christmas jumper night and this year i'm trying to find a Doctor Who themed one.

Now, i've found one by Forbidden planet https://forbiddenplanet.com/130078-doctor-who-sweater-christmas-sweater/?utm_source=googleps&amp;utm_medium=comparison&amp;gclid=CIae-sX1_MECFfHKtAod0HMAjw

and one on eBay http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DOCTOR-WHO-INSPIRED-ADULTS-NOVELTY-FESTIVE-TV-FILM-CHRISTMAS-JUMPER-SWEATSHIRT-/390975830868?. 

BUT, the issue i'm having is they're really more sweaters than jumpers (i'm British, wearing a sweater instead of a jumper on Christmas is punishable by up to 10 years on prison). Does anyone know of anywhere/anyone that might sell some? Or anyone who could potentially make one? 

Thanks a lot
