Our current form suggests we're not even ready for champions league football. We've lost 4 games, drawn 2 and won 6. That's an average of around 1.6 points per game. We're playing some tough teams in the next month, including Man United twice, and Liverpool. Good news? Home games. But we can drop points so easily. Here's how I'm going to predict some tough games.

Man United - Form all over the place at the moment. They can score goals, we struggle to score goals. Possible draw/loss

Fulham - Defence has been solid. They've been playing poorly over the past few games so we should win/draw.

Sunderland - Away game and we struggle with away games. Win/Draw.

Liverpool - Playing consistent, lost to Southampton at home and Arsenal away. Other than that they win most of their games. They struggle against us when we play them at home however this season they have a solid style of play and with players like Suarez, Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho we're going to have a tough time. It looks like we will draw or lose.

To sum this up, we need to average 2.0 points per game to get anywhere near a top 4 place. We can't afford to lose any of our next 6 games. City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, United and Everton are all going for a top 4 finish.

But we now look equally vulnerable playing a regular four at the back, if not more. What does this tell us about the problems herein?

* Does the fault lie with Rodgers, with none of his teams being defensively stellar? Is the onus on attack justified even when playing away, risking a potential Spurs-at-Etihad situation? Or is he taking each game differently, adjusting accordingly?

* Or is it the lack of a proper left wingback who can convert to a flying winger when attacking, and the 5th defender otherwise?

* Or is it the lack of a midfield enforcer, leaving Lucas with too much to do when Gerrard decides he wants to bomb forward? If so, does the answer lie within ala Allen/Henderson, or do we need a totally different type of player we admit we've been missing (M'Vila playing Mascherano's role?, with Lucas not dirty enough and relying more on positional sense)

IMO, Rodgers' teams will always attack with menace, as we looked capable of scoring even with Suso/Sterling/Shelvey/Borini starting. But attacking freedom comes with the price of a lack of organization at the back, that we regularly face when Sakho/Cissokho/Johnson get caught   ahead of themselves, sometimes.

Plenty of people have expressed their dissapointment in not seeing the entire Hurt-Eccleston regeneration. I was in the same mindset at first. However, after thinking about it, I've come to the realization that it would have been a bad move. 

At that moment of the episode, there is an atmosphere of hope and happiness with the three Doctors going their seperate ways after having saved the day and possibly Gallifrey (we don't actually know for sure if their plan worked yet). There is a bit of talk about not remembering the day and talk of Trenzalore, but overall there is a positive mood. Now, imagine if we had seen the complete regeneration, and Eccleston was there, not having remembered that he DIDN'T commit double genocide, probably moaping about, maybe yelling in agony. That would have been a major buzz-kill and something I would not want to see.

Does anyone else think this completely invalidated *The End of Time*? A bunch of Daleks accidentally engaging in friendly-fire does not amount to the destruction of a species that The Moment supposedly unleashed. Also, the evil Time Lords (led by Timothy Dalton) in *The End of Time* supposedly exist during the same day as the Time Lords in *Day of the Doctor*, so why would they be so vicious in *The End of Time* if they know The Doctor didn't use The Moment? Also, wouldn't abstaining from using The Moment not time-lock the war? Finally, aren't all of the evil things The Doctor mentioned in *The End of Time* escape too?

Since the new series started, we have had 3 Doctors and the Time War has been the biggest deal about it.

Clearly this was SUPPOSED to have Christopher Eccleston doing the Time War whining because that was his *whole thing.* It fit in with what turned out to be a character arc between the three of them, dealing with the Time War. Clearly the Rose manifestation was meant for him. 

Too bad CE didn't want to come play, so they said ""Fine, we will do it anyway and we will replace you with mfing screen legend John Hurt. All we have to do is say he's a regeneration and we're done. We will bend the entire canon around him, he will get all your cool scenes, the show must go on.""

and it turned out awesome. Let's see what all we got: 

-Plenty of cheeky Matt and David screen time, which we all wanted, lots of fun.
(Again, Chris, sorry you didn't want to come play.) 

-Cute tie-in from Tennant's multiple cracks about Elizabeth. 

-A whole new incarnation of the Doctor, who happens to be John Hurt, who was fantastic. 

-TWO NEW REGENERATION SEQUENCES:
Exit: Paul McGann finally gets his well deserved credit on this show. 
Enter: Peter Capaldi, as the *last Doctor* searching for Gallifrey. 

-""ALL 13 OF HIM"" saving Gallifrey. (Make no mistake. Moffat has been lying when he said he wasn't renumbering. Hurt counts. He was The Doctor. They made that 1000% clear. There is no question of this. He was credited as The Doctor. His face did the screen zoom. He was in the lineup. The scot is now David Elevennant.) 

-50th Anniversary, we got a 3 Doctors episode, where he fixes his biggest problem which defined the universe and three (sorry, four) of his regenerations, they use some really satisfying justification for HOW he does it:

Time. He had Time to think about it. 
Come on. That was cool. They even foreshadowed with the screwdriver.

Would it have been BRILLIANT to have Eccleston instead?
No doubt. He was my favorite. I'm a little annoyed with him right now. 

I don't care in the least how this interferes with the lunatic Time Lord garbage RTD did because it A) it was lunatic garbage and B) it doesn't. They changed history. You got that part, right? They changed history? 

MY only beef is ""the Daleks will destroy each other in the crossfire."" Moan. 

And a final thought on the companion complaining: First companion on the show, current companion. Viola. That's all there is to it.

We did not look like a Prem league side and our boys looked like they were playing a pick up game with a bunch of randoms. Why am I happy? Because this was the kick in the arse that Tottenham Hostpur needed. There are no excuses when you concede 6 goals and fail to score any. All of the optimistic Spurs redditors can now stop blabbering about how we need to gel and bla bla. I've always been more of a realist than an optimist, and since the appointment of AVB, I've lost any sense of optimism that I had (Gareth did make me feel better at times but I couldn't shake that fact that he was carrying our entire team last season). Under Redknapp we saw brilliance from a good amount of other players and I enjoyed our style more before Bale's golazos. Don't get me wrong, they made for some exciting matches but I almost would have rather gone back to the team where Gareth would beat players and deliver a pin-point cross right to a striker's foot. When AVB took over, it almost looked as though he tailored the squad around Bale and played a huge part in crafting him into the Madrid winger we see today. But Gareth is gone and AVB has brought in an almost entire new squad to build from the ground up. The first thing AVB should be doing is working on getting the players acquainted with one another and I feel like this needs to extend off the pitch. We are currently a group of players, not a team, and AVB needs to assert some type of authority in order to get them to start helping one another. I gave him the benefit of the doubt after that quick spell at Chelsea and how it was the player/owner egos and what not. But now I am legitimately frightened that AVB may not be the young whipper-snapper manager that everyone praised him to be. I am starting to have flashbacks of the Ramos era and it is really starting to scare me. But that doesn't mean I would stop supporting the wonder that is THFC. We sing when we're shit, so heartache is nothing new for us. I guess I am just more upset with all of the preseason optimism and no one thinking to point out that we may very well have a dodgy season before any of our new young starlets begin to mature and gel. Do I think we will finish in the top 4 this season? Not at all. Top 6 perhaps, but even for that, this club needs to wake up and get their shit together, even if that means looking for a new manager.

Think about it:

1. Everything we know about the Time War, we've learned through the Ninth, Tenth and to some extent Eleventh Doctors, including how the war ended (namely, the Doctor using The Moment to destroy Gallifrey.)

2. The end of Day of the Doctor tells us that neither the War Doctor, nor the Tenth Doctor will have any memory of the events of the Last Day of the Time War (beyond the War Doctor hauling The Moment out to the middle of nowhere in a burlap sack.)

3. If the Doctor remembers the War Doctor stealing The Moment with the intention of using it to destroy Gallifrey and the Daleks, and then wakes up after it's done having regenerated into the Ninth Doctor, with no specific memory of how it happened, he's going to presume he killed them all by himself.

4. However, since he has no memory of the events of Day of the Doctor, how do we know that the three Doctors working together isn't what always happened to end the Time War? We have an unreliable narrator recounting what he believes happened, but we have objective proof that it didn't. It's much easier and neater to just accept that Day of the Doctor is what always happened, and any inherent contradictions with regard to what we've been told about the Time War are the product of inferences the Doctor has drawn from a lack of memory of how it happened.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Is it really a retcon?

We played poorly, and were punished for it.

But those of you calling for ""AVB out!"" or ""Change All the things!"" need to relax. Do you remember where we were this time last year?

13/14 - 12 games played - 20pts.

12/13 - 12 games played - 17 pts.

our twelth game last year was the 5-2 loss to Arsenal at the Emirates. It was our third successive defeat in a row, having previously lost to Man City away, and Wigan at home. The cries were coming in for AVB's head (or at least his job).

And then we caught fire; a 0-0 draw with Lazio preceded wins against West Ham and Liverpool, which led into an unbeaten December.

For those of you saying ""that was last year AVB's had a year now!"" ... well, sort of. We started 7 players on the field yesterday who didn't play in the fixture lasted year; and we are trying to integrate 10 players (our 7 summer acquisitions, plus Danny, Andros and Kaboul) who barely played for us last year; It's a lot of change; a lot of players learning AVB/teammates/ the system, a lot of people settling in to England, London, the team, a new language, etc.

The bottom line is that we are a young, talented team. We have a lot of good players, and despite the scoreline, we were the better team for most of the first half of that game, even if we couldn't get anything resembling a result. We are getting there, and we will be very very good.

There has never been a case (as far as I know) of a team that plays attacking, positive football as well as we do, with the amount of talent we have, where it just totally falls apart. Playing as we do, with the talent we have, will eventually pay off for us. We have to believe in that, because *that's who we are.* We're Spurs; to Dare is to Do, the game is about the Glory.

So this is just a reminder to all of you who feel that we'll never get there; We're already ahead of where we were last year, and we only missed the Champion's League by a hairsbreadth last year.

We'll be fine. In AVB/Levy we Trust.

So Gallifray has been saved, in a pocket demenion, with all its people safe. I know there was a line there that the Dalek fleet would destroy themselves in the crossfire when the planet dissapeared... (well it won't be any surprise when the next Daleks show up and mention being a ship that survives the crossfire). 


I would guess that the individual Daleks trapped on Gallifray after it was moved would be cleaned up by the Time Lords.


But Tennant mentioned before that it wasn't just the Daleks that were the danger during the last days of the time war.
'Not just the Daleks, but the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been-King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-weres'


So yea I would expect this to be a problem in the years to come once the Doctor retrieves Gallifray... which granted could be really cool to see the Doctor going out to stop the greatest weapons and warriors the Time War produced from destroying the galaxy.

I've been a DW fan since childhood and I don't know if I could have avoided *all* the spoilers if I'd had to wait until Monday night to see it.

We only have basic cable and live in an area where they weren't showing the 50th live in any theatres, so that morning I went on a hunt. I found out that The T.A.R.D.I.S. Room in Portland (fish &amp; chip shop) was showing the 50th LIVE, so I woke up my fiance and begged her to head over there with me an hour early. She's a DW fan but a bigger fan of sleep, so she deserves an honourable mention for going along for the ride.

Unfortunately, The T.A.R.D.I.S. Room was *packed* wall to wall with Whovians; every chair was taken and every standing spot was filled with people staring at the big screen TV's playing the last few episodes of DW. We hung around for about 10mins before I realised that even though we *could* cling to the walls for 3hrs and watch the special, we wouldn't really *enjoy* the special in that fashion; it was loud, cramped, and uncomfortable.

We left The TARDIS Room and started brainstorming ideas. Eventually, my fiance decided that if we *really* wanted to see the special, we should just pay Comcast to upgrade our account so we could get the BBC. Adding all those channels just for one night was worth it in my head to see the 50th special Live.

So she called Comcast while I raced home, anxiously anticipating the special that would be airing in 20mins. She asked them multiple times if we would get the channel immediately -otherwise what was the point?- and they assured us multiple times that we would get the channel *immediately*.

Well, we get home 10mins before the show starts and low &amp; behold - we don't have the BBC yet. Frantic and frustrated, I made the executive decision to go off the grid and wait until it's re-aired 8hrs later. I turned off my phone and decided that today was the day I would paint my boss' shed.

By the time I got home, we had arranged to have our other Whovian friends meet us at our house to watch the special together, so I was *super* excited for the event. But we *still* didn't have any of the channels we had just paid for. I was getting irate.

(**This is where the fun begins**)

I called Comcast to find out what the deal was. After 20 straight minutes of automated messages and voice prompts that couldn't interpret my accent, I got through to a human being. Sharon was very professional and helpful, but she eventually explained that the Comcast rep we had talked to that morning had **lied** to us; we were not physically capable of receiving the BBC and other channels with our upgrade until the new equipment had arrived and been set up.

Well, I was mortified. Why the hell had we gone through all this trouble when we had *explicitly* asked multiple times if we would get the ONE channel we wanted immediately? I understand the technical implications, but that's why we asked!

I politely asked Sharon to cancel any payments or fees associated with our new upgrade as I had not received the service I expected, and she immediately connected me with a Resolution Expert. I was a little miffed at this point because I knew they were treating me like an angry cancelling customer, which simply wasn't the case.

So a Resolution Expert gets on the line and is so sugary sweet it's almost unbearable.

&gt; RE: What can I help you with today, sir?

I explained the entire situation; we wanted one channel for one night, the guy before had lied and said we would get the channel immediately, we didn't get it so now I would like to cancel the upgrade.

&gt; RE: That's completely unacceptable sir. What can I do for you right now to make this better, short of giving you the channel you want because as you know that is **physically impossible**?

I explained that I was happy with our service and all I wanted was to go back to our original plan because we had only upgraded to get that one channel for one night.

&gt; RE: There you go, sir; you have your original plan back and I'm even giving you a $20/month discount for the next year as our way of saying sorry. Out of curiousity; what was the one channel/show you were trying to get? This seems like a lot of trouble for one night.

I explained to him our love of DW. I explained the 50th special and the desire to avoid spoilers. He asked me if I was British and I explained yes, born &amp; raised, which is why I *really* wanted to watch the special on the day it aired.

&gt; RE: But didn't that show air this morning?

&gt; Me: Yeah, but it re-airs in an hour and I've been off the grid all day.

There was silence for a moment.

&gt; RE: Sir, please hold for a few minutes.

I held for a few minutes.

&gt; RE: Sir, could you do me a favour and check the BBC channel one more time, just to humour me?

Confused, I switched the TV to BBC. Suddenly, we had the BBC channel.

&gt; Me: Uhhhh, we've got BBC...

&gt; RE: Ha, awesome, it worked. Sir, I have tricked your Comcast box into *thinking* that it has something it doesn't. You go ahead and enjoy your show tonight and if you decide you don't want the upgrade package, feel free to cancel it tomorrow and I'll still honour your $20/month discount.

I had chills and was almost in tears. This was customer service above &amp; beyond the level I was expecting. **We were going to watch the show thanks to this person.**

&gt; Me: I don't know what to say, you're amazing! Thank you so much!!

&gt; RE: Sir, my coworker &amp; I here are **huge** Doctor Who fans. We just want you to have a great night. Thanks for choosing Comcast!

&gt; Me: I love you so much right now, thank you!

And then we hung up. Our house watched the special, and it was as magical as I had hoped.

I understand that Comcast guy had all the power and they can do anything they want even if they say they can't, but the fact that he went out of his way to do something they're not *supposed* to do (give us extra channels without extra equipment) filled my heart with joy and glee, the likes of which no customer service representative has ever done before. He was a Doctor Who fan who couldn't let a fellow Whovian suffer, even though he himself probably hadn't seen the special yet.

After much convoluted confusion, Saturdays airing of The Day of The Doctor was as exciting and eventful as I could have hoped, and we have Comcast Guy to thank for that.

**I Love You, Comcast Guy.**



**TL;DR** Ordered extra channels just to watch DW, person lied and said we'd get them immediately but didn't, next Comcast guy said he could do anything *but* give us the channels, finds out we're DW fans, works magic to give us channels so we can watch DotD.

After watching DoTD, I think Ive realized the meaning of the alluded to question ""... on the Fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a question will be asked — a question that must never ever be answered: ""Doctor who?"" In DoTD Hurt Tennent and Smith are described as 'The Warrior' 'The Hero' and 'The Doctor' which i am interpreting as also meaning 'The Healer.' Now, we saw 8 make the choice to become The War Doctor, so is it possible that Smith's Doctor will be facing a similar choice, but this time the choice being what kind of Doctor does he want to be; instead of what kind of Doctor he needs to be? 

From Hurt through Smith I believe we've seen the different facets of the Doctor, and on the Fields of Trenzelore he will be forced to choose one, be it the warrior (hurt) who willingly joined the fight, or the hero (tennent) who had good intentions but truly never shied away from conflict and often found himself having to make morally ambiguous decision, or the healer (smith) who is known for the command 'run' and oftentimes actively avoids conflict but in the end finds that he puts those he cares about in harms way. I may be totally off the mark but I'm curious on thoughts or if anyone can put this better than I.

Hi all, I've looked everywhere for a link to Daniel Sturridge's interview with Arlo White (NBC commentator), but can't find one, so I thought I'd transcribe it here.

&gt;**Arlo:** This club is making such huge strides, which you're very much a part of. Going into the season perhaps a position in the top 4 would've been an aim; are you starting to think to yourselves this is as wide open as it's been for so long, perhaps the title isn't out of the question?

&gt;**Daniel**: It is wide open but he key is for us to continue to do what we do best, which is play good football and to work hard as a team, and we'll see at the end of the season where we'll end up.  I think top 4 is the aim; Champions League football is what we really want, but if we can do more that'll be fantastic.

&gt;**AW**: That chip against West Brom, is that Daniel Sturridge at your most confident?

&gt;**DS**: Possibly yeah. These kind of goals happen sometimes, and sometimes they don't. Luckily for me that day it did happen for me, but I think what's most important is that as long as the team is winning the games and as long as they're challenging for the top 4, for the CL and even beyond that, you never know. But I mean it's most important how the team's going.  I get elevated by my teammates and get elevated by the team's successes. **It's not great being a very good individual in a team if your team's not doing well. It's about being a part of something and being part of a movement, which is what I'm a part of right now.**

&gt;**AW**: I think confidence is maybe the wrong word then. Maybe it's assuredness...that you feel like you're one of the main men here.  Whereas in the past if you'd tried something like that, like you did against West Brom, and it didn't come off, you might be fearing the consequences of it.

&gt;**DS**: I think that I feel more at home now. I feel like I can go out on the football field and express myself.  In the past I've had....I'd get an opportunity for 15 or 20 minutes or whatever it may be, or I'd have 1 start out of 10 games or something like that and it's very difficult to express myself because I feel that in that one game, or that one moment of 15 minutes, I have to show everyone what I can do, or make something happen if I'm coming off the bench. **So it was difficult in those times, but now I feel like I can go out on the football field and play relaxed and not worry about scoring in the first 10 minutes or about 'oh I've only got 15 minutes to show what I can do here'. You can build your game during the match.**

&gt;**AW**: Now that Luis is back, tactically, during the 90 minutes, what does it mean for you when you're lining up alongside him?

&gt;**DS**: It's not different.  You have to go out there and do what you do.  You have another strike partner which makes your job easier because they [defenders] have something else to worry about...whereas before, if you're up front alone or you have someone playing off you, the defenders can mark you and keep their eyes closely focused on you.  But when they've Luis to worry about...the teammates behind us make it very easy for us...we just get all the plaudits. I don't think they get the credit they deserve. We [SAS] enjoy playing with these guys and it's a great feeling to be a part of something that's going on.

&gt;**AW**: In order for a partnership to be successful between two super players such as yourselves, to a degree do you both have to park the egos at the dressing room door before you go out?

&gt;**DS**: There's no egos involved at all with anybody in the club. It's Liverpool, and that's what it's all about. It's not about me, or Luis, Stevie, not anybody. **It's not about any individuals, it's about Liverpool Football Club and the club is bigger than *any* individual. That's what we all understand.**


TL;DR - Daniel Sturridge talks about his confidence, about how much more relaxed he is here at Liverpool than his other clubs, and how it is playing alongside Luis. Also mentions that no one is bigger than the club and that Liverpool matters more than any one person.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Transcript of Daniel Sturridge's interview with Arlo White,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1rfsur/transcript_of_daniel_sturridges_interview_with/

-finding a place to stay. I'd be renting a room in a shared flat for sure, however how easy is it to find a place? Any tips or advice on how to find friendly/safe places to stay?

-social life. What is the nightlife like? I am not a clubber or party animal but I enjoy a good beer from time to time. What sports are popular there? 

-finding a job. How difficult is it? Is there work?

I consider myself a pretty persistent soul and I am completely fine with working in a pub or have a secretary like job. 

Things I have to do while I'm there? I will be there a total of a year with traveling to other places throughout.

There seems to be a pervasive belief here that the moment was never used previously, and that nine and ten simply assumed they used it but couldn't remember due to wibbly-wobbly.

I don't buy that.  If they have a blank space in their minds, they're not going to simply assume they must have used it.

I believe that the moment was originally used and Gallifrey burned.  I think the intervention that saw Gallifrey hidden away instead was a change in the timeline from eleven's POV, while 8.5, 9 and 10 continued to experience a timeline where they had done it.  None of this they must have forgotten and assumed BS.

We can set aside arguing over the semantics, timelines and technicalities for a moment.  The underlying story since the reboot has been about the Doctor grappling with the gravity of what occurred during the time war and his search for redemption.  

There has also been a story arc through eleven's series that time can be re-written, with a lot of discussion of the implications of fixed points in time.  We then saw that the Doctor was able to escape his death despite it being a fixed point in time, by making it appear to observers that the incident occurred.

It just seems to me that pretending the moment was never used after all, and it is all a big misunderstanding, is just a little too cut-and-dry and doesn't do justice to the stories that have been told.  

The doctor made a mistake with devastating consequences.  That's ok.  We don't have to pretend it didn't happen.  Eleven will continue the search for redemption by finding and restoring Gallifrey, still knowing what had originally occurred and how he changed it.

I'm not here to talk about any perceived contradictions.

In TEOT, shortly after noting the theft of The Moment by the version of The Doctor that is on Gallifrey, the Time Lord High Council uses a trace-back of The Master's Insanity Beat^TM to find their way out of the Time-Lock that seals any parts of the universe affected by the Time War off from the rest of reality (with, presumably, an alternate progression of events filling in the excised time).

Rassilon and the inner core of the high council emerge through the Immortality Gate and taunt The Doctor and The Master, while Gallifrey itself appears to VWORP VWORP into space near Earth.

While the Doctor is trying to decide whether to shoot The Master, or Rassilon, The Master implores him to shoot Rassilon: ""Shoot him, he's the Lord-President! Shoot him, and you can have **all of Gallifrey**!""

When The Doctor instead destroys the machinery sustaining the temporal link between Earth and Gallifrey, the Time Lords and Gallifrey begin to get sucked back home. But not before a deranged Master dives on Rassilon to exact vengeance for the drum-beat signal that has been driving him insane for his whole life.

The Time Lords vanish, *along with The Master*.

Moments later, in TDOTD, The Time Lord *War Council* decries the failure of the High Council's plans. A short while later, every incarnation of The Doctor turns up and removes Gallifrey from the time-stream altogether.

(**TL;DR**): At the end of TDOTD, The Doctor resolves to find, and perhaps free, Gallifrey from its temporal isolation.

What will he find there?...

Everyone up to Eight is the same, with John Hurt as the Ninth Doctor, Eccleston as the Tenth, Tennant as the Eleventh, Meta-Ten as the Twelfth, and Smith as the Thirteenth. As we all know, there is a limit to how many times a Time Lord can regenerate, and with these new numbers, it looks like the Doctor has hit that limit. Now, there has to be a way for him to get around this ""law"" in order for the show to continue. 

My theory makes Peter Capaldi the First Doctor. How? Well, obviously, somehow the Doctor will get around the limit. I think the limit is half genetics and half Time Lord-imposed law. The limit is there to keep Time Lords from living forever and perhaps if they live too long, bad things happen. The genetics half of it could be that beyond thirteen lives a Time Lord grows weaker or can go insane or something of the like. I don't know how the Doctor will break this rule, but my guess is it will have something to do with the return of Gallifrey. Anyways, back to what matters. Matt Smith will regenerate into Peter Capaldi who will be the Fourteenth Doctor, but technically, he will be the New First Doctor. 

William Hartnell was 55 when he first starred as the Doctor, the same age as Peter Capaldi is now. I know it's not really true, but as far as appearance goes, it would seem that each regeneration of the Doctor is younger than the last. In a broader look at it, you will see Hartnell at 55 and now Matt Smith at 27. That's a huge gap in age. When John Hurt was introduced as the Ninth Doctor I though he would destroy my theory. But as we saw in The Night of the Doctor, McGann regenerated into a young John Hurt who grew old naturally. 

This is the last part, I promise. However Matt Smith gets past the limit, it will start a new regeneration cycle. Basically, he'll be starting over. I'm sure the numbering will stay to avoid further confusion, so he'll be the Fourteenth Doctor. But, in terms if this new cycle, he's the First. 

I know this was kind of scattered, I'm pretty bad at explaining things. I hope it's easy enough to read. What do you guys think about this?

Will this Christmas special be the end of Doctor Who?  Is Capaldi just a red herring?

To this I say HA.  For various reasons.  Throughout the history of the revival of the show, there have been various hints as to the continuity of Doctor Who not being limited to the 13 regeneration limit as was stated in Old Who.

First and Foremost, the earliest 'blip' in this theory occurs when Tennent channels the regeneration energy from his body into his hand - creating the metacrisis doctor.  The theory behind the 13 regeneration limit is the deterioration of the body due to constantly changing - Tennent didn't change in this situation - simply used the energy which can be rebuilt.  This brings Smith's Doctor Number down to 12.

The next instance is feature at the beginning and end of Series 6, with River shooting the Doctor.  Yes, I know it was actually the tesselecta.  But the system that knows everything about everyone would surely know that the Doctor was on his last regeneration, and not start to regenerate after being shot only once.  

In ""Let's Kill Hitler"", River channels her life regeneration energy into the Doctor, forever cementing her into the form we see her as and giving the Doctor extra regenerations.  This exclusively stops the 13 limit, by giving him more chances to regenerate.

In ""The Day of the Doctor"" there is a second, a split second, where Peter Capaldi's eyes flash on screen and someone says ""No sir, all thirteen!""  - Which indicates regardless of any past numbers, Capaldi is going to be considered the 13th Doctor, and he existed as a doctor at some point, with access to a phonebooth Tardis.  There is no way to disprove this point - we all saw it happen.  However, this can be a two sided blade here - on one hand, it eliminates the current idea floating around that Smith is the last Doctor and this Christmas Special will be the end - but it also brings to mind the question as to why one would say ""all"" thirteen - I have an answer for this as well.

One would specify all thirteen because of the amount of time Gallifrey has been existant.  The Pre-DotD Gallifrey had only encountered 1-8.  Then however, 8.5, 10, and 11 show up.  This causes them to recalculate.  They then think they're are twelve, until the thirteenth TARDIS, Capaldi's come's rocketing into orbit.  Because of the close proximity of DotD and the Christmas Special, these memories are still fresh in Capaldi's mind, and he goes back to help his previous doctors, as simple as that.

TL:DR People have been speculating the Christmas Special will be the end of the show - this isn't going to happen.  The regeneration limit has been fanagled and messed around with, and Doctor Who has proven that rules aren't rules - just guidelines.

I see two options:

First, the easy way out... This is where Smith is given new regenerations by the Time Lords, and his burial on Trenzalore ends up being a far, far future event. 

The tough way, the way that I think it could go, and the one that will divide fans... Capaldi isn't the same Doctor as we know. Smith dies on Trenzalore on Christmas, and has no more regenerations. Capaldi is another Time Lord, a very young one, who Smith bestows his legacy onto. This would be smart writing, and allow a truly new Who mythology to be developed. Capaldi takes on The Doctor's name, and even syncs up data between his TARDIS and Smith's, so as to provide all the perks and benefits of lifetimes of experience. No regeneration happens, because they aren't the same person. The entirety of the 13 Doctors would collectively be known as ""The first"" Doctor.

The presumption is that he showed up to help his other 12 incarnations lock Gallifrey in a giant time lord cube, much like the paintings seen earlier in the episode.
i propose that he was not helping them save Gallifrey, but that he was present to get trapped with Gallifrey for the purpose of breaking it out later.
my reasoning?
The Curator. Tom Baker's cameo as The Curator was not a simple Cameo. I believe that The Curator is The Doctor. More specifically, he is the final incarnation of the doctor, his quest is completed and he retired as a museum curator exactly as Smith's incarnation fancied. When Baker told Smith that the painting was named ""Gallifrey Falls No More,"" he was telling Smith that their plan to save their planet worked.
This inspires Capaldi's mission: save Gallifrey.
Why does Capaldi have to be on Gallifrey when the other 12 lock it away? Because, like the Time Lord Paintings, Gallifrey must be freed from the inside, since all the paintings were broken from the inside.
I even see Capaldi needing a powerful method by which to break the massive dimensional barrier between our universe and wherever Gallifrey ended up...
The Moment.
Maybe the Operating System/Bad Wolf will help the doctor free the Time Lords...
And, there's a very good chance that The Master (the broken/crazy/lightning thrower) is still there fighting the Time Lords, (because it would provide a great villain and conflict to the story; he could steal The Moment or something).

Meaning that he has been searching time and space for the fleeting memory of this ""bad wolf girl,"" and running into her in the department store basement in the first episode was *not* a totally random occurrence. 

And then he goes on to save her life after she becomes the Bad Wolf and defeats the Daleks at the end of series 1, who have been chasing him since the events of DotD!

Now that the 50th has aired we know for sure he was a past incarnation, so she should have seen a bunch of him, especially since he started so young at the end of Night of the Doctor. My friends theorized that she didn't see him because it was just the being's called the Doctor's timelines, but that doesn't make sense to me, I believe it was the whole entities timeline.

TL;DR included.

**Step 1:** Clara makes Eleven realize he needs to ""be a doctor"" and find a solution other than using the Moment.

**Step 2:** Eleven announces he changed his mind. He starts explaining the idea, and as soon as he says that ""this time there's three of me"", the plan becomes part of the memories of Ten and the War Doctor as well (“This is brilliant!”, “I’m getting that too!”). This means…

**Step 3:** At some later point Eleven travels back and ensures all his previous incarnations know the plan. How would this work?
At first I figured that since no Doctor earlier than Eleven retains any memory of the plan and its execution, he would have had to contact every version of himself separately. But if this were true, Ten and the War Doctor’s memories would not suddenly “awaken” – they would have to have it explained to them. 

The fact that they suddenly remember means that in some locked away part of their memories, all the Doctors had always known the plan... but since when?

Eleven says that he had been ""thinking about it for centuries"". If every Doctor only knew the plan for however long it took to execute, there would be no time to plan. So, possibly, only one “centuries-ago” Doctor would have had to be directly contacted (probably the First). Subsequently (perhaps as soon as 11 left) this Doctor would forget it all, but his subconscious would be working out the details for centuries…

**Step 4:** …until Eleven becomes aware of the entire plan centuries later, right after first conceiving it.

**Step 5:** Since Eleven now knows the complete centuries-in-the-making plan, he could convey it to the First Doctor right away when he meets him, making the whole centuries-long planning-process redundant due to an ontological paradox.

**Steps 6 through 16:** At a certain time for each incarnation (perhaps random, perhaps a moment chosen by the Moment’s Interface), that incarnation would become aware of the plan and travel to the end of the Time War to execute it (after greeting the War Council). This incarnation would then forget the plan until the right moment in his next regeneration and so on for 10 regenerations...

**Footnote:** Clara-shards would either not be able to witness the plan or entirely forget it. Otherwise Real-Clara would know about it already.

**Step 17:** When Eleven's “turn” arrives he takes a minute to explain the basic idea to Clara and the audience (Ten and the War Doctor help since their memories have been awakened at this point). The Moment Interface is smiling because she knew this would happen all along...

**Step 18:** The War Doctor travels back to the Time War and shoots the message ""Gallifrey Stands"" into a wall so the Timelord War Council will notice, and really, just because it's cool.

**Step 19:** Eleven, Ten and War Doc explain the plan to the Timelord War Council. At this point it is still a ""terrible plan"" because the calculations haven't begun.

**Step 20:** The First Doctor begins calculations in the Tardis, as this was part of the plan. Calculations continue for about 1200 years, and are completed in ""Eleven's Tardis"" or possibly in Twelve’s at the very same time they began. The results are then transmitted to all the previous incarnations’ Tardis-es.

**Step 21:** When Eleven executed his part, he would see **and remember** that his future Twelfth-Self was there too. Just something to keep in mind, since Eleven is the first incarnation to retain a conscious memory of the events.

**Step 22:** Twelve would at some point  in the future take a break from searching for frozen Gallifrey to go help freeze it.

**Step 23:** Many, many years and regenerations later, most likely after Gallifrey was found safe and sound, an Umpteenth incarnation resembling the Fourth doctor would travel back to the day the plan was conceived (from Eleven's perspective) and ensure that Eleven knows he must find Gallifrey, since the plan had worked.

**TL;DR - the plan to save Gallifrey as shown in the 50th requires that 11 meet 1, and some locked away part of the Doctor awaken once per regeneration and execute it.**

**Conclusion** – We need a ""Smith meets Bradley-As-Hartnell Mini-Episode"". Plus, obviously the real answer is that the Rule of Cool defies any logical explanation. But this is all still fun to think about. Any better ideas about how the plan would work out?

(Are they gone?  Okay, good!)

I think because we already visited Trenzalore in the Name of the Doctor, I wasn't expecting we'd go back so soon.  But I guess we have to, because it's Smith's last episode, and the Fields of Trenzalore is where The Fall of the Eleventh will occur -- ~~which is also the name of the Christmas Special~~ (it's actually ""The Time of the Doctor"", and not something cool like ""Silent Night"". *Yawn*...)  He even tells Tenant's Doctor he's seen their final resting place there, so we don't really have a choice, his ""I don't want to go"" protestations to the contrary.

I honestly don't know what to expect now.  I remember a lot of speculation that the Doctor had fulfilled the prophecy already, or anger that the villains weren't the Silence, or perhaps even the sense that this event was still far, far in the future.  Obivously not.  We are going back to Trenzalore, except now at the ""right"" time.

Why the heck would he go back?  He was already lured there once.  Is it like a Milliways thing where he has no idea it's Trenzalore before it's too late?  And if the outcome of that final, terrible battle that we saw in the Name of the Doctor will remain unchanged... how does Peter Capaldi enter into the equation?  This didn't just look like the fall of Matt Smith's Doctor, but the Doctor *at all*.  Dead.  Gone.  Kaput.  No body, just a fissure in time and space that you can apparently take a joyride through, and a dead, decaying TARDIS where its bigger-on-the-inside-ness is leaking to the outside.  I don't know how you come back from that -- especially without mucking up time.

Also, the Doctor won't get out of answering ""the question"" this time -- and it probably isn't What Do You Get If You Multiply Six By Nine.  Does that mean the audience also gets to find out, once and for all, ""Doctor Who""?  After Day of the Doctor, he certainly seems more at peace with himself.

Whatever we find out, I expect it's something that goes to the heart of the character, why he took on the name, and what he will gain if and when he finally does find Gallifrey.

Any theories out there?  I thought I'd be more torn to fits by the 50th Anniversary, but this one is really hurting my head, hahaha.

BUT for some reason my whovian sister is refusing to go in order to see a hokey game (curse you Canada!), so I'm heading with my mom who's only knowledge of the show is that it consists of an alien man who flys around in a phone booth.

What I need someone to do, who has seen the special, is to try and explain all the criteria that she needs to know in order to fully appreciate what we are going to see.

I don't need crazy character backgrounds of anyone who doesn't appear or anything slightly erelevant to someone with no backgrounds knowledge.

If this is even possible, please help! Shes really exited to spend time with me weather or not she will understand it. But I want her to enjoy it with me, not just because I'm there with her. Thank you!

Next season(s).  The overall story arc is the search for the time-lost Gallifey.  He ultimately finds and frees Gallifrey, but it is a great personal cost and he knows that he does not have much longer to live. He is brought before the council of Time Lords  They do the math and see this is the final form of the Time Lord known as The Doctor, the one who saved them from ultimate destruction.  In some big ceremony, where they proclaim that without this one man there would be no more regenerations for any Time Lord, each member of the Council redirects regeneration energy to him, refilling his ""regeneration tank"".  They each give up a life as a reward for the billions of lives he has saved.  A wider shot shows that regeneration energy is not coming solely from the council but from many others in attendance who wish to thank him.  How many lives does he have left?

Anyway - I'm here because I need to ask for some help! Myself and 4 other MYPs are launching Turn the Tide - a mental health campaign (or 'social movement') which is aiming to help weather the storm of cyberbullying and negative self-image that is growing among young people on social media. We want to help this by encouraging a 'culture of positivity online' and allow a way for people to compliment their friends, and embrace what they like about themselves.

2. In The Night of the Doctor, Eight regenerated into a young looking War Doctor. Early in The Day of the Doctor, Eleven said that the city fell on the one day he fought in the Time War. So what was the War Doctor doing for long enough for him to age that much?

3. Is Peter Capaldi's Doctor the Valeyard? The Valeyard was described in the Sixth Doctor era as the evil side of the Doctor, and was an incarnation somewhere between his twelfth and his final incarnation. Additionally, it's well known that Time Lords have 13 regenerations, so 14 incarnations. In between 12 and 14 would be his thirteenth incarnation, and thanks to the War Doctor, that's Twelve, Peter Capaldi's Doctor. But, considering the Valeyard's actions in the Sixth Doctor era, I doubt he would've attempted to save Gallifrey, like Peter Capaldi's eyes did in The Day of the Doctor. So if I rule out Capaldi being the Valeyard, it means that the Doctor has more than 13 regenerations, but it's never been explained how that would work.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Some thoughts after The Day of the Doctor (Spoilers),3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1rgv8o/some_thoughts_after_the_day_of_the_doctor_spoilers/

So, as you can see from the title, me and my mate have thought up of this awesome idea of creating a deck of cards based around Doctor Who! It's probably been done but we don't really care, it won't be the same as ours.
Our thoughts so far;
-the hearts will be the Doctors
-diamonds the companions (i.e. Rose and Amy)
-the blacks will be the enemies of the Doctor, we're thinking the spades could be his mechanical enemies (i.e the Cyberman) while the clubs could be his organic enemies (i.e the Ood)
-on the card back will be a picture of the Tardis, not entirely sure on color scheme so maybe black and white, maybe color
-ace's we haven't decided yet
-jacks, well one HAS to be Captn' Jack! not sure about the rest however
-the red queens will be Donna and River, the black we are undecided
-the kings we must figure out
-and the joker has to be the Master of course!

So reddit, we need your help. You can help by doing any of the following:
-provide us with pictures of all 11 Doctors. We are looking for pictures that have a color background or one that can be easily photoshopped (i.e. HD photos)
-same as above for the companions
-same as above for the enemies
-what to put on the ace's
-what to put on the other jacks
-what to put on the the black queens
-what to put on the the kings
-any other ideas or modifications

Thank you for any and all suggestions, all will be taken into consideration.
Cheers

So, what if we used that idea?

William Hartnell did not regenerate into Patrick Troughton. The Doctor said his body had been ""rejuvenated"". Troughton was just a younger version of Hartnell's Doctor. 

* Therefore, both Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell both played the First Doctor.

When Patrick Troughton handed the role over to Jon Pertwee, he did not have a regeneration. The Time Lord's merely changed his appearance. 

* Therefore, Jon Pertwee, Patrick Troughton, and William Hartnell all played the First Doctor.

Jon Pertwee regenerated into Tom Baker.

* Therefore, Tom Baker is the Second Doctor

When it came time for Tom Baker to hand the role over to Peter Davison, the Doctor's death was caused by him falling off the radio telescope. The change in form was aided by The Watcher merging with the Doctor. Meaning this was not a proper regeneration. 

* Therefore, both Tom Baker and Peter Davison played the Second Doctor.

The regenerations from Davison to Colin Baker to Sylvester McCoy to Paul McGann to John Hurt to Christopher Eccleston were all pretty much without incident, without getting ironically technical with McGann. 

* Therefore, Christopher Eccleston was the Seventh Doctor. 

So then we had David Tennant, who got two regenerations.

* Therefore, David Tennant played both the Eighth and Ninth Doctors.

David Tennant regenerated into Matt Smith. 

* Therefore, Matt Smith is currently the Tenth Doctor.

What I'm trying to say is the number of the Doctor is the number he says he is. His number is his name of sorts. The Eleventh Doctor calls himself the Eleventh Doctor, so therefore he is the Eleventh Doctor. If I said my name was ""John Smith"" I wouldn't want you to call me Steven, now would I? The Tenth called himself the Tenth so therefore he is the Tenth Doctor. The War Doctor did not call himself a Doctor so therefore he is not counted in the lineup.

The Doctor is who he says he is.

If Smith's Doctor will die in the Christmas Special, from where the Capaldi's Doctor would come from? Well, the current Cybermen are almost all from Pete's Universe and there's also a Torchwood there, but we never knew about a Peter's Universe Doctor. If there's a Torchwood there, a Doctor is implied to exist, since Torchwood is an achonym for Doctor Who. 

Also, the Doctor lies. And he could had been lied to Rose when he said the Meta-Crisis Doctor will age and die. Maybe the Meta-Crisis Doctor is a Time Lord like any other, but in his very first body. The Doctor could had shifted places with the Meta-Crisis Doctor to stay with Rose and we've been seeing the Meta-Crises since 'The End of Time'. But that theory could contradict the episode ""Let's Kill Hitler"" (unless the TARDIS lied, also).

Its funny though, I remember roughly 4-5 years ago, he said something along the lines of ""I would propose then and there if a girl told me she was into Doctor Who.""  However, his views changed when a lot of female fans got into the show. He grew tired of trying to discuss the show with fans and all they could say is either ""bowties are kewl!"" or ""Matt Smith is sooo hot!""  To him, these fans are ""fake"" and ""posers."" They only watch the show because Matt Smith is so dreamy and has a jawline that looks like it was cut from stone.  

I thought of something though.  Is it really any wonder that girls are into the show? I mean, a big portion of it is about a unique and eccentric man who takes girls (and sometimes guys) away from their mundane lives and takes them on adventures.  He always makes them feel special and shows them that they are just as unique as he is. If you take out the word ""Doctor"" and replace it with ""Prince"" you could easily have yourself a Disney film.  I'm personally a pretty casual fan.  I haven't really seen every episode, but I've seen plenty from both the old series and the new.  I think its great that girls are into it, but I feel sorry for the ones that will stop watching because Capaldi isn't ""hot."" 

So my question: What are your thoughts on this? Is my friend right and a lot of female fans are only into the show because the main character is attractive? Or do you think there is more to it than that?

Ok, if you keep reading you've clearly watched it. If not, you're not a very bright person and I don't care.

Just one question really... 

So I watched the special in the cinema today. And while I loved it to bits, there is one thing gnawing at me.
Do you not think that it's a bit of a shame (actually - a terrible, terrible shame!) to have this inherent darkness in the Doctor removed for the future regenerations? I mean, ever since the reboot, there was always this dark and tragic part of the Doctor, that was beautifully counteracting all his silliness and high jinx. This tragedy of the impossible choice he had made, the knowlesge that he had been capable of that decision... Gallifrey or the Universe? And I loved that, I loved the darkness and the bitterness occasionally seeping out I loved how well it served the character. 

Now the burden of that has been lifted (and it has, regardless of whether Gallifrey was actually saved or not - I know people are discussing that still - because even if the Doctors failed in saving Gallifrey, they took affirmative action, they haven't pressed the button, they haven't made that decision, that's something easier to live with).

And I know that past regenerations won't (didn't? It's getting a bit timey-wimey here) remember this, and go forth believing they have made that terrible choice, the future ones will know... 

Well... unless some terribly clever twist is coming soon.

Do you not think that it's a bit of a shame (actually - a terrible, terrible shame!) to have this inherent darkness in the Doctor removed for the future regenerations? I mean, ever since the reboot, there was always this dark and tragic part of the Doctor, that was beautifully counteracting all his silliness and high jinx. This tragedy of the impossible choice he had made, the knowlesge that he had been capable of that decision... Gallifrey or the Universe? And I loved that, I loved the darkness and the bitterness occasionally seeping out I loved how well it served the character.

Now the burden of that has been lifted (and it has, regardless of whether Gallifrey was actually saved or not - I know people are discussing that still - because even if the Doctors failed in saving Gallifrey, they took affirmative action, they haven't pressed the button, they haven't made that decision, that's something easier to live with).

And I know that past regenerations won't (didn't? It's getting a bit timey-wimey here) remember this, and go forth believing they have made that terrible choice, the future ones will know...

Well... unless some terribly clever twist is coming soon.

What do you think?

Fed up of our best CB playing at left back.

Fed up of sideways and backwards passing with so little tempo to our game before we some how stupidly give away possession.

Fed up of the ""most shots in the league"" stat that was being trotted round when most of them are 30-40 yarders from Defensive Midfielders or Wingers.

Fed up of the inability to pass or cross a ball to Soldado. Inverted wingers is clearly not working.

Fed up of Townsend thinking he's Gareth Bale because I'm sorry mate but you're not there yet. If you want to cut in and shoot every time you've got the fucking ball then could you please actually score a few more. 21 goals in 33 appearances and you're a hero, 1 from 10 with 45 shots and you're getting annoying. Take away the penalties and Townsend has had essentially DOUBLE the shots that Soldado has from less games. GIVE THE BLOKE SOME SERVICE.

I know we've got half a new team and them getting to play well with each other takes some time and I don't suddenly think they've become awful just after a few games but I've had enough of seeing the same mistakes game in and game out from players and a manager who should know better. Is there really any reason we've got to persist with inverted wingers cutting and shooting and long range no hopers from DMs as opposed to getting the odd cross in and looking for the killer pass?

Giroud took another 157 mins to score his 5th goal (all the while providing no assists), so Soldado would have to play the full 90 for Spurs next two games without scoring or assisting to be worse off than the Frenchman.

This is a bit of a long shot but was wondering if anyone can help with a bit of advice/knowledge? I've lived in Brighton for 5 years and I adore the city and all it offers and stands for. I've worked for a company for about 3 years and I now feel my commitment for the job has run it's course. I'm a counselling and psychotherapy student and doing this has been profoundly life changing and I no longer fit with the nature of my job. So I'm looking for another one. One that makes a difference to people and their lives and doesn't involve using psychological sales techniques to get people to buy things they don't need and make a large corporation more money. I am looking for something real and fulfilling fans haven't got a clue what's out there! I don't qualify as a counsellor for another 2 years so my request is that if anyone has any insight in to jobs available in Brighton that fit my cause or even where to look I would greatly appreciate it.

We're back, and with arguably a quieter week than we're used to round these parts. The top two are unchanged and **ThePlays** have widened the gap to 29 points, but there's a new entrant stealing third place as **Only Bee N Your Bony** (answers on a postcard if you understand that name) jump in ahead of **Slumdog Mignolet** et al. **Hiphopasaurus** and **Zehlendorf FC** both just about cling on to their top ten statuses despite poor showings this week, but there's no other new teams breaking into the lead group.

Far and away the best performance of the week was from **Nick's Team**, who scored 89 points and rocketed from 48th to 26th place, having previously never been higher than 39th. **The Nether Lads** also reached their best position yet in 39th, although this is only their fifth week in the league. **Metalingus** (6th), **Jelavic Yellavick** (11th), **The FC** (16th), **Hibbo4England FC** (21st) and **Dirac FC** (38th) also achieved club-best positions this week.

####Biggest movers:
Clearly **Nick's Team** recorded the most improved position, rising 22 places, but there were few other teams making significant gains. **McBitchez FC** (+12) were the only other side in double digits, while **Pointless** rose by 8 places to reach their best position since the opening week.
After some steady improvement in recent weeks, **Rangers United FC** (-17) dropped the most places, followed by the **South Coogee Wombats** (-10).

The code to join the league remains **375561-306516**. Anybody wanting to check out their team's historical performance can do so on [this here spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak5ieGUOod7fdDJaV0RmYzB2YVBiZk96VGxDMlQtN3c#gid=0).

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- Despite only making the first 11 due to an training injury Suso marked a whole 90 game in Almeria's crushing 5-0 defeat to Real Madrid. Not much more I can say, really. He may not have been fully fit, but even if he was the impact he could've inflicted would most likely have been minimal. Real simply too for new boys Almeria, and although Almeria's attack is relatively strong - and improving as games go by - their defence seem to make silly and unorganised mistake too often. Correctly punished by Real on the Saturday evening. 

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Conor Coady also got back to playing for Sheffield United in their 1-0 over Bristol after a couple games on the bench. Reportedly, and not for the first time, Coady played on the right wing. The game time Coady is receiving is vital to him. He's receiving competitive game time when he needs it, we shall see when he returns to Liverpool if he is able to step up. Personally, I don't think he's good enough, but I have no doubt he could make it with enough determination.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan yet to return to Groningen's starting line up, and has not spent the last 3 consecutive games on the bench.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Pepe Reina's Napoli were on the end of a shock defeat to at home to Parma. Napoli now sit 6 points behind leaders Juve after their 2nd consecutive defeat. With the knife edged tie against Dortmund at the Westfalenstadion on Tuesday night Napoli will hope to regain form. Although they will be without playmaker Marek Hamšík.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Jack Robinson -- still suspended, he'll be back next week, though.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi didn't play in Stoke's 2-0 win over Sunderland. 

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini played 20 minutes in the same fixture. Although, wasn't too influential. Mostly due to the controversial red card Wes Brown received.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Wisdom continued as Derby's first choice right back. I have to say, I'm disappointed not to see him get some time at his natural centre back position, but playing time most importantly is what will benefit him most. Derby won the game over Bournemouth 1-0, with Wisdom having a relatively good game.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s are still on their mid season intervention, they return next Monday in a tie at home to Villa.

**Liverpool U18s** -- Three U18 games to cover. The first being a tough 3-1 win away to Sunderland. The equal energetic first 10 minutes was broken up by a goal by Sheyi Ojo. A brilliant through ball from O'Hanlon met Ojo between Sunderland defensive line and the onrushing goalkeeper. Ojo rounded him, and slotted into the empty net. A double from Jerome Sinclair followed. His first being a fantastic goal where he slotted jinked from left to right, and hit his shot off the post and into the net. His second technically was an own goal (but own goals aren't fun). The cross was put into the 6 yard box, and under pressure by Sinclair the defender put it into his own net. Sunderland got one back late on with a penalty. [\[Highlights of the game here\]](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x17duzi_u18-s-sunderland-1-3-liverpool_sport)  

The second game was a straight forward 2-0 win over Wolves. O'Hanlon again impressing as he gave Liverpool the lead. However, Sergi Canos was the player who stood out the most. His gave Liverpool their second with a wonderful lob over the rushing Wolves goalkeeper. He really showed his quality. [\[Sergi Canos' sublime first goal for the U18s\]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Df3q5wIMA)  

The final game was a disappointing 3-1 loss in the Mini Mersey Derby, albeit against a very good Everton side. Liverpool played probably the strongest side they could, ignoring injuries. Starlets such as Ojo, Chirivella, Phillips, Wilson, Kent and Sinclair all started with the impressive Sergi Canos making the bench.  
The opening of the game was fairly even, with both sides have a share of opportunities. However, it was the Blues who opened the scoring through the impressive Ledson. Everton doubled their lead when captain Green's free kick was somewhat bizarrely parried into his own net by second choice goalkeeper Firth (In for the injured Crump).   
However, Liverpool came out a side looking to make a turn around in second half. The likes of Ojo, Sinclair, Kent and Wilson continued to cause problems, but with no breakthrough with Everton, notably, defending brilliantly. That brilliant defending came to fruition as it helped Everton earn their 3rd. On the counter attack, Everton forced Liverpool's number running back to their own goal. A ball crossed to the far post allowed Everton to go 3 up with a header from Duffus.  
Liverpool got a little more control of the game when Joe Williams was sent off for a horrid challenge on Pedro Chirivella which forced him off with injury. The rightful red card allowed Liverpool more of an insight but they couldn't find a goal despite all of their prodding and probing. Although, the quality of Everton's defending was, again, notable. With 20 minutes left Sergi Canos was sent on by Neil Critchley, and although his impact was notable, it wasn't massive. His impact most notable when his shot was saved onto the bar. That was the closest Liverpool came to scoring prior to winning a penalty from a handball. Sinclair took, and converted giving him 5 goals in 5 games since his return from injury.  
Despite a late resurgence against the 10 men of Everton, they held on, and - again notably - defended very well. The U18s next game is this Saturday away to Newcastle. [\[Joe Williams' horrible challenge that was sent off for\]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iZ7SdyaubU)

Last night the theater was awash with sonics, bow ties, tweed, floor-length scarves, fezzes, and billowy dusters. it was a fantastic way to celebrate the history and future of Doctor Who and was a very telling experience. The theater was packed with hundreds of Whovians of all ages and was practically at capacity. By contrast, the Star Trek Fathom Events never topped 50 theater-goers in my little corner of the US. Here were scores of devoted fans laughing and cheering as classic and modern Who trivia flashed up on the screen. When the lights dimmed and the 'silence your cellphone' warning popped up, someone gleefully shouted ""Sonics too!"" to geeked-out cheers. 

The next 75 minutes were full of thunderous applause as inside-jokes, classic Who references, and the Doctor's wit were on full display. There were some emotionally stunning moments that had us squeezing significant others, friends, armrests or strangers; grasping for something to help tether us while being bombarded with so many powerful revelations. And the final two scenes... forget about it. I was practically on my feet howling, stunned by the sting of my own applause. 

I admit that I sneakily watched the episode when it aired, because, why not? Who wouldn't want to be part of the record-breaking simulcast event? While I loved the episode, nothing would have prepared me for the crashing waves of feels during the theater event. it just proves that free expression, community and shared experience are at the core of what makes being a geek so damn amazing.

So /r/askuk I'd like to ask you, what do you think? I'm obviously interested in knowing what Scottish people think but also I'd love to hear what other non-Scottish, and even non-UK citizens think. 

I'm English and in my opinion I think Scotland should stay in the UK but when I really think about it the only reason I can come up with (apart from not wanting a much higher percentage of Tory MPs in Westminster) is because I think it would be weird and sad for it not to be. However if the Scottish people want out then I feel like that's their right.

We saw 9-11, so, all the recent ones on netflix. And then we saw the 50th anniversary. Okay. So here is what we're totally lost on.

We don't understand how the doctor is like, the doctor. Like, don't all the time lords regenerate? And don't all the time lords fly around in Tardises and like, meddle?  So when did the original doctor be like ""i'm better than all of the rest of the time lords and let me take my tardis and go fuck around with everything""?

So like - in the time war, right? John hurt is like, doctor 8 1/2. But everyone was like OH MY GOD THE DOCTOR IS COMING. How did the Daleks know to be scared of him? How did the Time Lords know to be like 'goddamnit it's the doctor'? He's just notorious for meddling? So he was actually born like 104104801481 gazillion years before the time war, so everyone knows him?

Also, apparently in night of the doctor, the (sixth I think?) doctor legit dies and doesn't regen until some alien dudes are like, yo drink this shit. Okay but there were like five doctors before that, so like, how did they regen? 

tldr why is the doctor so special compared to the rest of the time lords. If he could freeze the planet in a little painting bubble, why couldn't they?

However, I'm getting sick of historically set dramas with plot lines preaching the virtues of lifestyles which would have been absolutely abhorrent to the people of the time.

Last night there was Ripper Street where the whole story turned on homosexuality and basically only the desk sergeant showed any of the prejudice of the time and that was mainly restricted to muttering euphemisms, while the main characters where totally anachronistic in saying nothing or quietly approving. 

Similarly, there was an episode of a hotel drama ""The Grand"" is it? It banged on and on about feminism in the most ham-fisted of possible ways and ended with a bit of well-received homosexuality. 

I caught a couple of episodes of Downton Abbey a few weeks ago. The major objection to one of the character's love interests was that he was a musician. To marry outside the aristocracy or at least the incredibly wealthy would have been unthinkable. To marry someone who was not English or at least from a list of approved European countries would have been cause for embarrassment. To marry a black guy...scandalous doesn't even start to cover it. It wouldn't have been an issue due the inherent prejudices of the girl.

Similarly very modern opinions pushing moral messages are laid on with a trowel in Call the Midwife.

I understand that especially the BBC may wish to educate as they entertain, but even the nicest of the characters at the time would have had views that we find repellent. It was received wisdom that men were superior to women, homosexuality was unnatural and criminal, black people were inferior and all the rest. Pretending that history was just like today but a bit dirtier with funny clothes and some people lived in big houses who treated their staff very nicely is the opposite of education. We've made significant advances in society and these modern costume dramas totally undermine that. 

I know these shows are just for entertainment and the writers have artistic license in having a few anachronisms here and there, but these views are the equivalent of having a stretch-humvee pull up outside Downton for a jaunt to London so the characters could talk about how they really need to be more efficient because one day we'll reach peak oil. 

I wish they'd just avoid these plot lines since no one wants to hear the real views of the time from the characters they love or anyone else.

Original post:
My pension works on a salary exchange basis (i.e. pension contributions are paid before tax). My salary is a few thousand above the threshold for higher rate income tax (40%), which I understand to be £32,011.

So, am I right in thinking that if I arrange my pension contribution percentage such that it takes my taxable salary below £32,011 then I will receive the lower rate of income tax (20%)?

Or is this nonsense?

Thanks!

Has there been any discussion anywhere if the character Osgood from the 50th anniversary special will be returning in regular episodes in the future? I think she was my favorite new character introduced on the show in a long time and I'd like to see her return as a regular or even become a companion. 

Given that it seems Capaldi's Doctor will be spending time searching for Gallifrey, it would be great if he had a companion who was ""sciencey"" along to help him. Plus I felt as if Osgood was the embodiment of DW fandom and I think people would love to cheer her on as a companion.

So yesterday I re-upped my CBT, would've gone full DAS but money, and because the CBT site was all on private land, they offered to let me take a supervised spin on one of their CBF500's. 

Having only ever been on a 125, and having been told that in fact the bigger bikes are easier than the 125's, I was super keen to try it out. 

From firing the ignition to parking it back up I had the biggest grin on my face. Yes, it was much easier than I was expecting, and yes much easier to control than a 125. And yes, it was just so much fun. The torque! Just giving the throttle a gentle little caress resulted in epic* acceleration (* i repeat I've only ever been on a 125). It was ridiculously easy to get up to speeds I hadn't experienced before. And the brakes! And the tyres!

Just everything. 

I thought I had been hooked on motorcycling. I now realise that I had merely been dabbling around the edges. Now, I want nothing more than another go. Have spent all day at work looking up cbf's (rather than reddit), figuring out scenarios which involve me coming into enough money to take my DAS and get the bike, making a hit list of rich but distant relatives that might have included me in their will, and figuring out how exactly I can convince the wife that I REALLYREALLYDONEEDTHATBIKE. 

Anyway, it was awesome. And if anyone needs to take a CBT or DAS in surrey,I really really recommend ridesure in cranleigh. Top people, great training environment, really helpful advice.

1) Roberto Soldado 
(25m+)
First of all it was clear we needed another striker in the summer so there is nothing wrong with the intent first of all. His record over the last year or so speaks for itself in a strong league so it seemed a fair signing initally. 
However, since I think the problems have been clear. Lack of service argument only goes so far, his movement is obviously lacking in comparison to a Defoe or Adebayor who turn at least some bad balls into ok opportunities. He shows very good touch far from goal but barely is involved in the game and particularly very rarely involved in dangerous situations. 
He lacks the ability to shoot from distance
He lacks pace meaning he finds it hard to get away from defenders
He seems too weak to muscle off defenders
My question to everyone is how the hell is this guy going to get goals?! Can anyone honestly explain?? 
Heres his goals from last year
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBHnymaOBe4
Feel we should have signed a player who has made a big impact in the Premiership before, a Remy, a Sturridge (few windows ago) Tevez or Dzeko for example.

When he saw his grave, what we saw was a Time ""knot"" (for lack of a better term). He thinks it is all the time travel that he's done and it is. His grave (the knot) isn't his grave it's Gallifrey, or rather the calculations that the TARDIS does (is doing) to save it, the tangle of time that having all the Doctors in the same place creates. 

When the Doctor freezes Gallifrey it has to go somewhere, and where is inside the TARDIS because it can fit inside it. This is why the TARDIS looks so banged up, it not dead (but may be dying) it's trying to hold Gallifrey in a moment in time but its not designed to hold time but move through it, and no one has ever tried to freeze a whole planet before so some of the bigger on the inside comes out. All of the Doctors and all of the TARDISes get ""trapped"". This is why when Clara jumps in she only sees the Doctor, not because its his grave but because its all of them doing the same thing at the same time this causes a problem which appears as the time ""knot"", which is also what timelord graves look like. (and why Hurt's Character says he had to do it, even though he regenerated right after he thought he destroyed Gallifrey.)

River knows what happens but we know she is good at hiding all that she knows, but she let out the Doctor can't go to Trenzalore because he can't finish as 11  (and regeneration might mean the end of their marriage, and if he goes at the wrong time it wouldn't work), he has to go as 12 because Gallifrey wont be saved unless all 13 Doctor (+War Doctor)/TARDIS comes because it needs to calculate the last bit. This would mean Smith has to die, so that 12 can finish saving Gallifrey.

The silence is really silencing of Gallifrey (Silience must fall, no more). The question that must never be answered is What/Who silenced Gallifrey? The whole time the Doctor thinks its the moment, a power that can't be mentioned and can't be found or even looked for, even knowledge of it was a secret to most of the Time Lords (the war board member didn't even know about it.) Or is its ""Who"" he thinks its his name. What's hidden in plain sight is the ""knot"" and the TARDIS and the answer to the question, or the Bad Wolf for ""Who"". (they have been saying the answer the whole time) And Silence will fall when the answer to the question is made at Trenzalore. (possibly by Clara and not the Doctor depending on if he remembers what happens in the 50th, I think she will and he won't)

He becomes 12, goes to save Gallifrey from Trenzalore (possibly the TARDIS does this when its done calculating at random time or mid regeneration). Leaving everyone to believe that 11 had just died (possibly even River), because the TARDIS comes back to the same time it was at. From this point you have a doctor without a TARDIS trying to find Trenzalore (instead of running from it), to let Gallifrey out now that he knows what it is and the next season. 

Just one thought.

TL;DR The doctors TARDIS is holding Gallifrey at Trenzalore, and the time ""knot"" there is caused by all his regenerations being at Gallifrey. So, it's not his grave it just looks like it.

I say this because I noticed that Billie Piper was not only stated in the credits as Rose Tyler but also that she is said to have been a remnant from the Doctors future, yet looks nothing like anything the Doctor saw her look like ie hair and clothing appearing very Goddess like.

She never states she's the supposed ""consciousnesses"" of the moment yet when she asks the Doctor he isn't aware of it even existed, he only guesses.  She says she gets mixed up whether or not she's the past or future because she has been weaving through the Doctors timeline planting Bad Wolf everywhere.

Now was Gallifrey was stuffed into that painting and the painting itself is the pocket universe? Or is the painting just a painting of Arcadia in the pocket universe and the Doctor needs to locate the pocket universe?

Whatever the case, I can't help but wonder if the Curator is the Doctor's TARDIS (a much older one) using 4 as an interface. Maybe after the Doctor's death (whether from saving Gallifrey or having a long, natural Time Lord life) the TARDIS takes his jest about retiring to be a curator seriously and stays alive as an art museum to honor her Thief. 

Besides the round things on the wall, there's the Curator's foresight into the Doctor's future and the fact he's an older version of the Fourth Doctor. It doesn't make sense that a future version of the Doctor would regenerate to look like an older version of his younger self (keeping up?). Unless the Curator meant it literally when he said he'll find himself revisiting a few, but just the old favorites buuuut I seriously doubt that means Baker, Davidson et al will be making a Who comeback.

We also had to choose a country for every course and I simply decided on England, since I live in Germany without any immigrational background within the last 10 generations, but at least speak English relatively fluently and have been there a couple of times.

I am supposed to cook together with those people, tell them about the history of the dish and the country and play some traditional music in the background, but I have come across some problems:

- Is there something like an equivalent to Irish folk? A very traditional kind of music without too many rock influences, but still kinda modern? I've been looking through some English Folk bands, but they all either play Folk rock or mostly instrumental music.

- I was thinking of doing a crumble, since it's easy, doesn't need many utensils and cutting apples is a great job for a few helpers, but I can't find much to tell about it other than that it became popular during food shortages in WW2.

However, I'm getting sick of historically set dramas with plot lines preaching the virtues of lifestyles which would have been absolutely abhorrent to the people of the time.

Last night there was Ripper Street where the whole story turned on homosexuality and basically only the desk sergeant showed any of the prejudice of the time and that was mainly restricted to muttering euphemisms, while the main characters where totally anachronistic in saying nothing or quietly approving.

Similarly, there was an episode of a hotel drama ""The Grand"" is it? It banged on and on about feminism in the most ham-fisted of possible ways and ended with a bit of well-received homosexuality.

I caught a couple of episodes of Downton Abbey a few weeks ago. The major objection to one of the character's love interests was that he was a musician. To marry outside the aristocracy or at least the incredibly wealthy would have been unthinkable. To marry someone who was not English or at least from a list of approved European countries would have been cause for embarrassment. To marry a black guy...scandalous doesn't even start to cover it. It wouldn't have been an issue due the inherent prejudices of the girl.

Similarly very modern opinions pushing moral messages are laid on with a trowel in Call the Midwife.

I understand that especially the BBC may wish to educate as they entertain, but even the nicest of the characters at the time would have had views that we find repellent. It was received wisdom that men were superior to women, homosexuality was unnatural and criminal, black people were inferior and all the rest. Pretending that history was just like today but a bit dirtier with funny clothes and some people lived in big houses who treated their staff very nicely is the opposite of education. We've made significant advances in society and these modern costume dramas totally undermine that.

I know these shows are just for entertainment and the writers have artistic license in having a few anachronisms here and there, but these views are the equivalent of having a stretch-humvee pull up outside Downton for a jaunt to London so the characters could talk about how they really need to be more efficient because one day we'll reach peak oil.

I wish they'd just avoid these plot lines since no one wants to hear the real views of the time from the characters they love or anyone else.

Anyway, The school is a beacon to other local schools due to its exemplary activities, staff, administration and parent-teacher liaison. In fact, parents and peers view the school so highly that they are the ones who began this petition and are the most voracious in its completion.

You see, Elton Primary is being used as an example by the government to show what happens when a constituency refuses to academise schools. It is a political pawn in the Michael Gove's great game of educational reform chess - and the children at school are the ones who will truly suffer. To those who don't know, the government are trying to stop funding schools and hand them over to businesses to run, mostly to save cash in my eyes. Now, this will obviously have repercussions - a school is not a business, and nor should it be run like one or by one.  This is because a business will always have their own selfish wants before the children's needs; equipment will not be garnered unless cheap enough for the owners, and other such problems will occur. My area, Bury, is one of the only places in the country where the authorities have gone against the government and refused to academise schools which don't need to be. Obviously, this has caused some issues.

The government seem to have been desperately hoping for a loophole, allowing them to forcibly academise the area, and they found one. If a school is doing bad enough in its Ofsted report (basically an assessment of how good the school is, based on all sorts of pointless and irrelevant measures of how good a school is), then the government can make the school an academy anyway. Now, I feel I need to reiterate just how good this school is: not only does it offer a great nurturing environment for children to learn in, it is also the most accepting of special needs children, particularly mentally handicapped or disabled children. The inspection before the most recent was brilliant - only one point on the report fell to ""satisfactory"" - academic achievement - and the rest were either ""outstanding"" or ""good"". It is again important to remember the relatively high number of special needs children at the school - this is why the academic achievement fell low, you can't judge special needs kids against children without special needs, unless, of course, you are Ofsted.

As you may have guessed by now, the school's most recent inspection yielded less impressive results, and I would like to say now that the standards of schooling have not dropped at all; if anything they have increased. It was given an average of a 4 - ""unsatisfactory"". How this number was gathered from a 4, two 3's and a 2 is beyond me in itself. Closer reading of the report brought up all sorts of, for lack of a better term, bullshit, planted in there by the inspector. Rumour has it that the inspector was a nasty piece of work himself, who was grumpy from the outset and was physically looking to fail the school - he would ring up Ofsted High Command to check if he could fail the school for some small piece of paperwork or bureaucracy they failed to adhere to exactly to the rulebook. Anyhow, they were failed, but the headmaster (who is an amazing headteacher) naturally pointed out all discrepancies with the report and sent it straight to Ofsted. This resulted in a response basically saying ""Thanks, but we don't give one"".

A followup inspection in a year's time again yielded a poor result, blatant lies, and much more bullshitting. You can come up with your own reasons as to why this happened, but I think it is fairly clear that Gove wants his academies, and Elton Primary is collateral damage for the borough of Bury. As a result, the government are bullying for an academy, harming these children's futures and more problems. If one school can be made an example of, then the rest of my area may also suffer from inadequate teaching due to authorities forcing them into academies. The school have done everything they can on an official level, and were essentially told to, uhm, go away. Therefore the parents have taken up arms against this gross attack on good schooling and a system that was in place for years without complaint. Against injustice and bureaucracy. Against their children suffering due to government pride. All I ask is that you stand with us and sign the petition, and if you feel truly adventurous, like the facebook page. Links are below.

TL;DR: Ofsted lied about a local school and gave it awful reports in order to change it into an academy in the only area in the country refusing this madness.

Ok, so we've heard Moffat's explanation that 11 is apparently the 13th regeneration, since we're adding 8.5 and meta-10's creation counts as use of 1 regeneration.

Where does that leave us for numbering Doctors?

What I think serves best would be to keep it as similar to previous numbering as possible, starting at 8:

8- Paul McGann (8th regeneration, 8th incarnation)

8.5- John Hurt (9th regeneratioon, fails to identify as any incarnation since he does/will not call himself Doctor)

9- Chris Eccleston (10th regeneration, 9th incarnation)

10- David Tennant (11th regeneration, 10th incarnation)

10.5- Meta-Tennant (12th regeneration, still the 10th incarnation because it's still essentially the same body, if we even want to factor him into numbering)

11- Matt Smith (13th regeneration, 11th incarnation)

12- Peter Capaldi (14th regeneration, 12th incarnation)

13+ - ???


This way, we're numbering *incarnations*, not *regenerations*. Numbering actors and true self-identifying Doctors.

True, we should bear in mind the number of regenerations that take place, but for numbering actor/Doctor-face pairs, I think we should try to keep our original numbers as much as possible.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Can we get something straight?

I could retire and do that.""), could the museum itself be one giant Tardis.

We know that the TARDIS can disguise itself as whatever (I'm assuming size on the outside can change as well someone may correct me on this point), but got stuck on being a police box sometime in the past. We also see the ""round things"" on the inside of John Hurt's TARDIS that was a throwback to the TARDIS of the previous Doctors and then again there were weird round things in the scene with Matt Smith and Tom Baker on the walls of the gallery where ""Gallifrey Falls No More"" was displayed. Also, I don't believe the Doctor would ever abandon the TARDIS even if he retired from his adventures because of the strong emotional ties he has to it.

I'm about delve in to a sensitive subject, so I'm expecting a shit load of downvoted. Regardless, I want to get this off my chest.

Jose has said quite a few things since he's been back. 

1. If a player plays well then he won't drop said player. 
2. If a player trains well then he deserves to start.
3. Players will have to get used to the rotation system.
4. He can't start every player in every match.
5. Players that don't perform will be dropped.


Independently, all those points are sound. However, he has kept his word pretty much never.

Hazard has been one of our worst attacking players this season. I know he has 4 goals, but in terms of creating and adding to the attack his contributions have been negligible - kinda reminds me of Joe Cole, drifting in and out of games whilst being more focused on supporting the full-back in defence.

Oscar has been our best player so far, so its fair that he is starting most of our games. However, Jose said he would NOT play Oscar out wide when asked about why he doesn't play Mata as AM and Oscar RW (like last season). Now 2 games in a row he has started Oscar out wide on the wing. 

On Mata... I have absoultely no fucking clue why he isn't even worthy of a substitute appearance. Mata has been our POTY 2 years in a row, and in less than 4 months it seems like he's going to be leaving the club!? This is completely ABSURD. This infurates me so much because when we have possession our attacks have been as dull as Sarah Jessica Parker's face. There is no zip in passing, there is no accuracy on our shots (and we barely get shots in to begin with). Its pathetic.

Now just 2 days back Jose said he can't start 12 or 13 players. He wishes he could give everyone a chance but he can't. APPARENTLY NOT. Gives Mata zero minutes vs Basel and brings De Bruyne on with 5 minutes to go. 

Don't even get me started on Lampard. Love the man to death, but he is fucking past it. I simply don't understand why Jose can't use Oscar in place of Lampard and Mata ahead of him as AM. Oscar clearly is not a penetrative passer or a world-class dribbler, so he relies more on making intelligent runs - just like Lampard. Mata, on the other hand IS a penetrative passer and sees passes most AM's don't. This is the MAIN reason he should be starting. The other reason would be he had 40+ goals and assists total, which apparently isn't good enough for some managers.

I see no difference in going Back to save galifrey.
Saving Galifrey to me removes the post 2005 doctor from a discription of a tragic hero.  He is now essentially a bruce wayne finding out his parents never really died.  Galifrey lives ergo the doctor has no reason ever to be jaded or somber because His people aren't dead. any reason the doctor is sad or angry is purely circumstantial on an episode to episode basis.

However, in episode 4 of the 6th season, (The Doctor's Wife) the Doctor mentions something about the control room/lobby(?) and the Tardis (a.k.a. 'Sexy') said she saves every copy. She then continues with something down the lines of having 30 or so future copies.

What was the point of forgetting it in the first place? Because now he has to find it. 

Now that he (Smith, 11th Doctor, or 12th?) knows and since the Tardis knew all along (because it's got a time vortex and knows the future for some reason) can't he just extract the info from the Tardis to where Gallifrey is?

Is it possible that there could be multiple Doctors (even multiple incarnations of the same Doctor) active on the same day in different places? Does it count as crossing his time stream if, for example, the Doctor was in Moscow and in London, at different points in his life, on the same day? 

If this is not possible, then can it theoretically be said that after enough time, the Doctor can ""run out of days""? What if a given Time Lord has already been to every point in time in history? Conceivable, given enough regenerations. Would that Time Lord then become a walking paradox, unable to visit any point in time without crossing his own time stream? 

What happens if one of the Doctor's enemies just chose days to which the Doctor had already been to hatch their plans? Would the Doctor be unable to go to that point in time to stop them without causing a paradox?

I started playing Dota 2 not that long ago but I straight away watched a week of youtube videos with advanced tutorials and managed to pick up my role. The role ended up being a hard support - 5. Reason why build stuck with me is because i am much for helping team getting kills rather than trying to get them myself. I think support is also the role that wins games as if we as supports do our role well, the team gets good farm for the carry's and we win! I have past experience in competing in tournaments etc so i know what has to be done when the pressure is on.

I know how to play Dota 2 at a decent level. As a support I know my role to a good standard as i know how to ward, how to play early game, how build my hero etc. Obviously as everyone I can improve and i think i would do that much quicker on a team. 

I am able to play most evenings as i got Uni during the day (6am - 8.30pm) . I have skype/raidcall or whatever other program you need to use to contact me. (i can get it if i don't).

I have a handful of questions relating to studying in the UK, I really hope I could have some answers. Some statements below aren't necessarily questions, just but may be half-truths which I need clarification on. 

* My father was naturally born in Scotland, and had lived there his entire life. He traveled the world for a bit, met my mother in Indonesia, and I was born in America. **If I'm not mistaken, I have inherited citizenship to the UK, correct?**

* From what I've heard, UK citizens are gifted free tuition from their government. Is this correct? **If so, am I qualified?** 

* How would I go at applying to a UK University, and are there important deadlines similar to US Universities? **Where could I get a hold of this information?**


* I'm incredibly interested in studying **Environmental/Sustainability Engineering, which UK schools have the strongest programs in relation to this field?**

* My unweighted **GPA is 3.75**, SAT score w/o writing is sitting at a **1200** (w/ is at 1710), my ACT composite score is **26**, and I will have taken and passed **6** Advanced Placement classes by my graduation. I have many extra curriculars and clubs under my belt as well. **Are these credentials high enough to consider acceptance from an international student?** 

* **What estimated costs will come by me by studying abroad?**

* **Do UK degrees hold the same value as US degrees?** As in, will employers in the US or any other part of the world dismiss my degree considering it wouldn't be acquired in the US? This may be a very ignorant question but I'm genuinely clueless. 

These are all the questions I can think of at the time, **it would be absolutely wonderful if I could keep in contact with any responders!** I understand most of you will be asleep right now, but thank you for reading!

What I realized, however, is that it actually reinforces important themes. Companionship and empathy. ""Don't be alone."" I thought about the Ten episode where the Doctor drowned the weird lobster alien babies (naturally, genocide on Christmas) and the hubris he displayed in the Waters of Mars. As you likely know, he was without a consistent companion. When alone, he gets tunnel vision and, in some respects, seems drawn to the horrific solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Doctor and the Downer Companion (#1)

DC: Doctor?

TD: (cheerful) Yes?

DC: All of your past incarnations are still out there, in Time and Space running around in this TARDIS. Now you remember all of those lives and you know that you make it up to this point intact and alive. 

But the more you time travel, the greater the statistical probability that you will change something for one of your past self's either directly or indirectly. This could cause an event you remember now as surviving, to one of ultimate destruction. You're like a cat with 12 lives, that can be retroactively aborted. 

TD: Meow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Doctor and the Downer Companion (#2)

DC: Doctor?

TD: (cheerful) Yes?

DC: Why is it that we don't try to save the countless innocent victims of all the many unjust wars? We have the power to travel though space and time, yet all you want to do is go on vacation?

TD: Mahalo! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Doctor and the Downer Companion (#3)

DC: Doctor?

TD: (cheerful) Yes?

DC: You've told me of all your other companions. They become very attached to you, yet have finite and much shorter life spans. Instead of seeing them though to their end, a time commitment off your life most comparable to only 6 months of a human; you give them only long enough until they remind you that time does indeed move forward for everyone else. 

Can't you keep me until I'm old and feeble?

TD: Next stop, your future.

I figured that this subreddit could use a thread like this, especially since we're all generally dissatisfied by the show's own writers (to put it in gentle terms). Fanfiction may get a bad rep, but there are definitely some good stories hidden [among the bad ones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law).

How it works: Read a story that you liked?

1. Link to it! Remember to credit the author!    
2. (Optional) Provide a summary? And a wordcount?    
3. Note any spoilers that the story contains!    
4. If it's slash, you should probably provide a warning for those who aren't a fan.    
5. Immerse yourself within the world of fanfiction to drown out the sorrows of the series 5 finale.

Feel free to review any stories that other people post! This can serve as a mini discussion group as well :D

Also, this doesn't have to be limited to stories in particular. Fan art? Video edits? All are welcome!

Additional info/tips before diving into the world of fanfiction:

* ""Slash"" means that the story pairs together two male characters. For example, Arthur/Merlin (also known as ""Merthur"") is read as ""Arthur slash Merlin"". The female equivalent is called ""femslash"".
* ""Modern AU"" means a story with the same characters, but transposes them into the modern day. Usually that means a college setting.
* ""Canon AU"" or ""Canon-era AU"" means that the story takes place in medieval times, but some aspects are changed (eg. Merlin raised by Balinor rather than Hunith, Ygraine doesn't die, etc.)
* ""Reveal fics"" are stories in which Merlin's magic is revealed. (Duh.)
* Prepare yourself for a million ""Magic is like a sword"" analogies.
* Lots of authors tend to distinguish between ""sorcerers"" and ""warlocks"". No, this is not canon. You are not going insane.
* For stories where Merlin needs a surname, it's almost inevitably ""Merlin Emrys"". Relax, this is not canon either.
* Anything else you think should be added to the list? Tell me and I'll edit it in!

I'd like to discuss the regeneration count with some of you since there is a lot of discussion and confusion among the community. This is how I perceive the regeneration count at the moment as is just what I think, if you agree or disagree please explain why. 

* 1st Doctor - 0 Regens - Body 1
* 2nd Doctor - 1 Regens - Body 2
* 3rd Doctor - 2 Regens - Body 3
* 4th Doctor - 3 Regens - Body 4
* 5th Doctor - 4 Regens - Body 5
* 6th Doctor - 5 Regens - Body 6
* 7th Doctor - 6 Regens - Body 7
* 8th Doctor - 7 Regens - Body 8
* War Doctor - 8 Regens (1 Artificial) - Body 9
* 9th Doctor - 9 Regens (1 Artificial) - Body 10
* 10th Doctor - 10 Regens (1 Artificial) - Body 11
* 11th Doctor - 12 Regens (1 Artificial, 1 into the severed hand) - Body 12

I should also state that I have only watched the ""new"" series, but do plan on watching the old within time. 

Anyhow, is this system of understanding the current Regen and Body count incorrect? It seems to me that a lot of people are confused how there can be a ""13th Doctor"" due to Time Lord regeneration principals. There's a few theories I have on the loop around that, one of them being the above list and basic reasoning to figure out what it is.

* 1) The Sisters of the Flame gave him an artificial regeneration since it was stated to be ""Time Lord Science"" as well as the fact that it wasn't random. This was A REGENERATION, but not one of his ""natural"" (if you can call it that) regenerations.

* 2) River song gave him her last regenerations therefore giving at the least probably 4 regenerations (Half-human meaning only 6 regens?) 

These are my thoughts and hopefully if there's a lot of people agreeing with this than it's just an accepted understand of where we stand now. I think the first one makes perfect sense if you just consider the regeneration trapped in the hand to not be a ""full"" regeneration or something along those lines. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Some people apparently have no understanding of what the (1 Artificial) means when appended onto the War Doctor +. It is used to count how many times there was an artificial regeneration. Meaning that there was only 1. Not that each of them was an Artificial regeneration. Let's say that John Hurt died and was brought back by the Sisters and given the chance to regenerate into Eccleston. Then it would have been (1 Artificial) -&gt; (2 Artificial). Simple stuff.

Here's the fixtures

Hull (A) 1st Dec
Norwich (H) 4th Dec
West Ham (H) 7th Dec
Spurs (A) 15th Dec
Cardiff (H) 21st Dec
Man City (A) 26th Dec
Chelsea (A) 29th Dec

So yeah, playing City and Chelsea away within 3 days of eachother is a bit ridiculous.

Looking at it you'd say if we can win the easy games on paper, that's 12 points if we can get a win against city/spurs/chelsea we'd be on 15points and that would be a fantastic return.

Going to be a huge test of the squad with so many games in quick succession.

Our flat has been without a water supply for 7 days now, and I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on what my options are as a tenant. We moved in at the beginning of August on an assured shorthold tenancy agreement.

So far, my letting agency, who manages the building, has been unable to fix it and cannot give any assurances of when it is likely to be fixed by, if ever. Apparently, the person who built the flat years ago did a bad job of installing the water supply (quoted ""illegally"" by a Thames Water engineer).

In this scenario, what are my options? Should I seek legal advice? I've never done this before so I don't know where to start.

Added information, we live in Hackney. Should I get in touch with the council?

EDIT: 
Oh, one other thing to add: ours isn't the only flat affected. Have spoken to the person who lives below me, and he also has no water. He actually owns his property.

According to the agency, there are 4 flats affected by this.

Then later, Rose and Clive(the man she goes to looking to learn about the Doctor), he shows her pictures of the Doctor at different points in time.  

So did the Doctor just regenerate before this episode?  I was wondering if there's an official answer on this ever since the 50'th special.  Either he did some things post-regeneration and pre-Rose and he just then notices himself.  Or he does those things sometime later in that regeneration and doesn't have Rose by his side.  In my opinion it's more likely that he just never notices himself cause he doesn't ever leave Rose behind first season to do his own thing as far as I remember.  I want to know if the Doctor just came from (in his mind) the utter genocide of two races before Rose or if he went the solo route for a while before Rose?

With so much of the spin around the coverage of ""Clare's Law"" being about domestic abuse towards women, I thought I'd dig out some statistics to see what proportion of domestic abuse was against men.

""Based on the 2010/11 BCS self-completion module, seven per cent of women aged 16 to 59 were victims of domestic abuse in the past year compared with five per cent of men (Table 3.01)."" [2010/11 British Crime Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116417/hosb1011.pdf)

That's stayed about the same, as shown by the 2011/12 results of the same survey (renamed the CSEW), available in [summary (figure 25)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/focus-on-violent-crime/rft-bulletin-tables.xls) or there's the [more detailed version of the same data (table 4.01)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/focus-on-violent-crime/rft-appendix-tables.xls) 

Equally, under the the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS) as [detailed on the Greater Manchester Police website](http://www.gmp.police.uk/content/section.html?readform&amp;s=903BB34BE34EDA3180257A71002DE9EE) there's no mention of gender at all; it all talks about ""partner"". (The ""click here"" links in the text don't work, but the two attachment PDFs can be found top-right of the page.)

But despite this, there still seems to be a spin, towards talking about ""Clare's Law"" in the context of protecting women, for example [Baroness Gale in the Lords](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#st_1), Home Secretary Theresa May's oft-quoted ""This is an important step towards ensuring we do better by women like Clare Wood in the future."" ([BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25077115), [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10472008/Violent-history-of-partners-to-be-disclosed-as-Clares-Law-rolled-out-nationwide.html), [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/25/clares-law-extended-nationwide-domestic-violence-wood), [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/news/clares-law-extended-nationwide-domestic-abuse-cases), ...), and a raft of news articles and opinions on the topic.

Is the UK, as a country, simply too sexist to deal with something like domestic violence without trying to pursue it as a gender issue?

I thought John Hurt was a fantastic casting choice; seeing David Tennant again got me to choke up on more than one occasion. The whole thing was actually my favorite episode since Moffat took over... And then the ending did something super messed up: it actually took away my favorite part about Doctor Who!

Ever since 9, the character of the Doctor drew his complexity from [](#s ""the destruction of Gallifrey."") He could be foppish and clowny and it didn't matter because he was walking around with a dark memory haunting him. When the three doctors [](#s ""stood with their hands on the big red button to activate the moment"") my heart almost stopped. And then they didn't do it. Not that I wanted them to, per se, but I also don't think a character like the Doctor deserves a free pass.

Moffat has shown us no-stakes writing plenty of times before, but I thought he was starting to get past it. There have been several times when he has written an entire plot about how something is irreversible (cracks in time that make it so you never existed, the TARDIS exploding with River Song in it and the entire universe being unwritten, the Doctor being shot by River at a fixed point in time, etc) only to have it be reversed with a quick fix and everything is back to normal. This one shouldn't have been. The idea that the Doctor had to make an impossible, horrific decision that now haunts him added a darkness this show needed, especially since RTD left, and now it's gone. He doesn't have to be haunted because he didn't do it.

How do you re-mortgage a house? I’m assuming that if I I’ve paid off enough capital I can drop down to a lower loan-to-value and get a better rate on the remainder?

If you change banks do you need to come up with an early repayment charge, or is that only if you do so before the fixed-term comes to an end?

Are re-mortgages based on the value of the property at purchase and the amount remaining to be paid off, or do they get worked out on the current value of the property?

So to not resolved this issue in the coming series, or to erase him due to some timey-wimey effect would only make the fans angry. So I'm here to add my own theory, which I have to say is unlikely what the writers will come up with.


What if the next Doctor impersonates, or more as said by GI, calls himself the Valeyard and presents himself to High Council of the Trial of the Time Lord as a prosecutor. He then can say that he is an amalgamation of the Doctor's darker sides to gain the trust of the Time Lords. He will then do exactly what he did as during the trial, like tampering with the evidence and getting defeated by the Sixth Doctor, partly because he knows how it happened, i.e. a self-fulfiling time paradox. And the reason for this: he needs full access of the Matrix, or put a tracker in it, so that he will be able to find Gallifrey is his current incarnation. And then the Valeyard mysteriously disappears.


So by this way, there is no need for a Dark Doctor, an embodiment, a clone, etc. and still connect with what we know. Of course, it means that the next Doctor has to disguise himself and wear a silly costume.  Since I haven't seen much of the Classic series, for those who have watched them, I wonder if this explanation might be plausible.

This is not a political post. This relates to Cameron's singleton (an impulse created by a desire to impress Claire Perry? His Wife? China?

For anyone who's not sure, Access to Higher Education is a route over 18's take when wanting to qualify and attend uni.


When filling out my UCAS form I mentioned the subjects I undertake on my course but I obviously couldn't mention the final grades and can only select 'Psychology - Pending', 'Sociology - Pending' etc. I cannot even select 'Pending, but Distinction expected'. I expect with my hard work and intelligence to achieve Distinctions all the way through my 5 subjects.


The course is marked 'Pass', 'Merit', 'Distinction'. I think these are vague equivalents to C, B, A. Anyway, the main 3 unis I'm applying for ask for 3/4 minimum Distinctions. 



Seeing as though I can only select 'pending' on my 'Education' section, will my universities offer me conditionals purely on my personal statement? My GCSE's aren't great either, so what is the path from there?

While these things changed me for better or worse, few were as shocking as the sight of Rafa Benitez walking in to Stamford Bridge as Chelsea manager

Here was a man almost universally disliked by the Chelsea fan base, a man vilified and held as the personification of traits of Liverpool fans that we despised, a man who was the chief adversary and often the victor during the first spell of JoMo. This last point is an often mentioned but usually overlooked point, with an inferior squad and far less resources, Benitez often bested Mourinho in one-off encounters thanks to his tactical guile

While we lamented the inconsistency displayed under Rafa, it's hard to argue that such inconsistency has not been a hallmark of the first few months under Mourinho also, with a squad bristling with more talent than that of last year. The darling of the squad relegated to a peripheral role that sees him spend more time on the bench than anyone could have thought possible, a lack of flexibility in midfield that results in a clearly aged legend tarnishing his legacy at the club through a series of underwhelming performances sprinkled with throwbacks to days gone by, the best Left Back in league history playing second fiddle to a converted Right Back

While we (as a whole) were hard on Rafa, there is no denying that he did a good job, the best possible result in the Europa League, a competition he was lumbered with due to the ineptitude of performances under DiMatteo, and a solid 3rd place finish that avoided the ever-troublesome qualifying rounds for the Champions League. He came to the club as public enemy number 1, put up with horrendous abuse for the entire season yet maintained a sense of poise and dignity as he guided us to a respectable finish and silverware. While there were some poor performances, we've seen equally dire efforts this season. The difference is in the personnel available, the support from the stands, the ability to bring in players and an entire pre-season to mould ideas and tactics in to the squad, instead of working on the fly just before the busiest part of the season

We've seen the worst aspects of Mourinho so far, many will not remember the best; the arrogant swagger of managing a team that would not lose, but we are no longer that team. The sense of pragmatism and reality under Rafa was not well received in all quarters but there was logic behind them, Mourinho would not take an attacking team to Old Trafford and play for a win, it is a case of not losing first and foremost. The casualties in this team are two of the most likeable players in the squad, Juan Mata and David Luiz. There is no room for the guile of Mata, nor for the drive and enthusiasm of Luiz (something Gerrard is lauded for) as neither is defensively minded enough for Mourinho. After yesterday's result we must also look at games where Benitez triumphed, starting with Basle, while under Mourinho we have faltered. A 1-0 victory at Old Trafford last season was also much needed, often overlooked instances of Rafa coming through when needed, playing the most attacking combination of players he realistically could

While it is too early to judge Mourinho, it's a perfect time to reflect on what was a tumultuous period under Rafa Benitez and look more favourably upon the job he did and what he achieved. We could have stuck with the man on a longer-term deal, while a section of the fans wouldn't have liked it, there would have been a bit more stability to the team and it would have been interesting to see what he could have done with an off-season to shape the team as he saw fit. Needless to say, the club's image could do with some improvement but we won't have that with Mourinho, his persona and dealings with the media are more suited to that swash-buckling, all-conquering team that we once knew and the associated confidence, nee arrogance, that comes with it.

**Current Score: Man C 4** - 2 Plzen

Events I consider significant:

22' - Fernandinho tries an ambitious pass to Milner which is cut out, Fernandinho wins it back with a perfect tackle and makes the pass to Milner.

32' - Penalty awarded after Aguero's cross hits some guys arm I don't know how to spell. Aguero sends the keeper the wrong way and buries the penalty.

40' - Milner gets a yellow.

44' - Some Plzen player scored.

Second quarter comes to an end.

Since I got a couple messages from people watch the ESPN stream saying Aguero was injured, there is nothing about in mcfc matchday centre.

&gt; Substitution

&gt;One change at the break - Jesus Navas is on for Sergio Aguero. A change in system for Manuel Pellegrini, then. Looks like an extra man in midfield with Dzeko alone up front.

Sometime Yaya came on for Fernandinho and Nasri scored.

He then looks knowingly at the fez and throws it in which leads to all the Doctors being in the same place.

But then at the end of the special, due to time streams crossing or *something* he tells his previous incarnations that they will not remember any of the events that have just taken place. This explains why he tells Tennant that he doesn't remember having met himself.

So if he shouldn't remember the events that have occurred...then how does he know to throw the fez into the time hole?

I'll be more than happy to repost my question elsewhere if there is a particular subreddit more suited for it.

I am located in London and am requesting legal advice on behalf of my friend who's situation can be summarised by the title of this post. So I'd very much appreciate it if someone could give me advice who is knowledgeable of the law in the UK regarding this situation.

A friend of mine has currently suffering from the loss of his father who was very dear to him. Before his dad passed away, he gave him a £600 watch he used to own. Needless to say, there's more in the value of this watch than the price tag. At another instance, my friend bought himself a £150 coat. He has recently gotten into an argument with his mother regarding the death of his dad, but after leaving the house in anger, he came back to find that his watch and coat were donated to charity (he spent a couple of days out. Also, he is unaware which charity the watch and coat were donated to) and a veryarge sum of money taken away from the joint bank account under his and his sister's name. The money in the account was intended to be his savings. 

Can anybody give me advice which I can relay to him as to how to tackle this problem or what legal actions he is within his rights to practice? Also, any ideas how the watch and coat can be redeemed? What about the money? Did his sister have a right to get rid of it all? Was the money rightfully his despite being in a joint bank account? Thanks!


**Edit:** I honestly didn't expect so many comments! I'm very grateful to all of your advice and will try to consider all of them. :) I also understand that Reddit is not a solicitor and we are not by any means using it as a substitute. We're still going to speak to a solicitor, but we just wanted to know what kind of options would be available to us or at least what to expect. Thank you so much anyway for all of your help!

If I am correct in my understanding he was appearing as a future doctor who had retired or some such and become the curator (as appointed at the very beginning of the episode by Elizabeth).

SO. The doctor (Tom Baker version) Says he may be revisiting a few old faces. I think he is referring to his old regenerations like himself back the same as the fourth. 

This means that the doctor will in the future revert and live as some of his past incarnations. I think this sort of rebirth and second chance of life for past doctors is a beautiful idea. 2 was forced to regenerate after a short lived life. Well he'll get a second chance. 4 gets a seconds chance and his regeneration lives to see old age. 10 didn't want to go? Well maybe he gets to come back later too.

I just though... if this was what was being suggested... it was an amazing idea which opened up a new world of adventures for all our favourite doctors.

Excellent episode, and I've never been more excited about a season of Who! But there is something I'm not quite sure of ... I've been browsing through online reviews, wikis, and synopsis of the Day of the Doctor, and I'm hoping you can help me find what I'm missing (I've sure it's obvious and I'm just being thick). 

Basically, How did Clara and the Doctor get out of the collective Doctor's time line from The Name of the Doctor? It seemed weird to me that Clara is teaching in school and running off to meet the doctor in the special, when the last thing we saw from the final episode of the regular season was Clara and the Doctor, both essentially trapped in the Doctor's timeline purgatory with no Tardis or other obvious means of escape.

I've thought that maybe The Day of the Doctor takes place before The Name of the Doctor, but it seems weird that Clara wouldn't recognize The War doctor in The Name if that were the case (Although there is some heavy timey-wimey in The Day of ...) However, 10 and 11's banter about knowing where he (The doctor) was headed and the revelation that they had been to Trenzalore suggests that it definitely occurs after the Name of the Doctor. (Assuming I caught that correctly)

The other thought was that given there were other Doctor's in the purgatory time-line, Clara and the Doctor may have *borrowed* another tardis and escaped to their own time line. Clara's reaction to ""Gallifrey falls no more"" would suggest that she recalls seeing the fall of Arcadia from the purgatory realm.

What am I missing? Are they in the prequels? Webisodes? Anything? The special doesn't really make any mention of it at all, and I've watched The Name of the Doctor several times trying to figure out the escape, but all I'm left with is the Pan out of ""John Hurt"" as the doctor.

When rose looked into the TARDIS she absorbed the time vortex energy.  This gave her massive god likepowers which she used to seed through time planting the badwolf message, influencing certain events n time, and making captain jack immortal.

well, supposedly she got this from looking into the vortex. but really, that doesn't make much sense.

now, what if the TARDIS was containing a sentient weapon that had been instrumental to the doctor, and could never, ever fall into the wrong hands?

My theory is that when Rose peeled back the console she was exposed to the moment.  which using its powers, like it did in the 50th, gave rose access to various spots in time  to help the doctor out.  Which would also explain why she chose that body to manifest in during the 50th. she had already worn that face, but only in its future. which she's bad at remembering which is which.

Even the name, badwolf, could never be really ascribed to Rose.  she wasn't bad, even with the powers.  But the big scary weapon?  yea thats the real big bad wolf to be scared of.

so, the doctor absorbs the energy, and negates it.  effectively killng the weapon, but makng the ultimate sacrifice n the process.

**Advantages**:

* Mainstream Media Attention: Largely from CNBC and Max Keiser (RT). Rory Cellan-Jones (BBC) also has a thing for them.

* Endorsement of Prominent Businessmen: Namely Richard Branson (Virgin Galatic) and OKCupid. Numerous small businesspeople and a few Subway franchises are using it as a marketing tool.

* Very low transaction fees: Key selling point in North American market

* Limited overall supply: Could help it be perceived as a good store of wealth (like houses).

* Amicable government response: The German government has recognised Bitcoin as ""private money"" and the US Government has thus far expressed that Bitcoin is a ""legitimate financial service"". No aggressive action has been taken.

* Difficult to trace: Makes it a good currency to gamble and purchase drugs and adult entertainment.

* Global smartphone ownership and usage is soaring.

**Disadvantages**:

* Volatility: A good currency is stable, although services like Bitpay exist to protect retailers from the changing exchange rate.

* Poor mainstream adoption: Difficult to buy and sell Bitcoins in the UK and other countries around the world. Adoption by retailers is still very limited.

* Alternative currencies: Amazon have released Amazon Coins.

* Association with criminals: Bitcoin is without a doubt the currency of choice for extortionists (Cryptolocker) and all round bad guys. This perception is a threat to Bitcoin.

* Threat of negative government regulation: Most governments have yet to formally express an opinion on Bitcoin.

* No FSCS protection.

Hope it's not just tumbleweeds round here, this subreddit deserves to live!

I'd like to know what people can suggest in this class as I'm not much of a petrolhead but know what I like. Long journey comfort. Heated seats. Collapsible rear seats on top of a big boot. Just as important is that it have a bit of poke, I want a car that I can pass Sunday drivers on a country lane without worrying it'll run out of grunt.

So, I previously had a 1999 Volvo S80 2.4 petrol and I loved it. Ticked all the boxes above. I've since had an S60  2.0 and it just wasn't powerful enough.

Nearly forgot to mention, I drive about 4,000 miles a year so fuel economy doesn't concern me.

Hoping for 4 or 5 models to choose between and I'm not averse to a bit of badge!

His first series would be his initial 'find Gallifrey' series which would culminate in finding clues here and there, with an epic finale against the Daleks because the Doctor knows they're looking for it to, so being the Dark-er Doctor I want him to be he'll manipulate the Daleks into a Civil War in order to distract them from beating him to Gallifrey.

His second series would work around the idea that there are a few timelords that managed to escape the pocket dimension where Gallifrey is, they are after the Doctor and wish to kill him, the finale would see that the Master is behind them all and the Doctor finds out via the Master where Gallifrey is.

The changes and the largely unknown opposition made this game hard to analyse but I want to make some points about our defence and our wide range of attacking options.

One thing that became quickly obvious from kick off was the two different styles we were playing. When unsure of possession, City would play the long ball to Edin Dzeko in order for him to hold up up and supply the wide men, Milner and Nasri. Richards and Kolarov would then look to test Plzen’s marking by creating overloads, overlapping and sending a cross into an oncoming Dzeko. However, Edin was largely ineffective for long periods at holding the play, leading the full-backs to make numerous failed runs and leaving huge areas of space for Plzen to exploit. 

The link up play between Nasri and Aguero though, was much less direct. Throughout the first half Aguero would drop deep to pick up a pass, confusing the Czech defence. Cisovsky would often be unsure whether to follow Aguero, leaving a huge space for Nasri to move into, or stay in position and give Sergio time on the ball. This was much more effective than playing direct for the first half and led to Nasri hitting the post and Aguero winning a penalty. 

As always, our attack looked like they would score with every chance they got and fitting to our season it was the defence which probably caused the talking points for today. I mentioned before the tendencies Micah and Aleks have to charge up the field, leaving acres of space behind them when they lose the ball. This, combined with the slow defensive trio of Lescott, Demichelis and Garcia led to us conceding the lead. 

Throughout the game our defenders seemed unwilling to press Plzen when they countered. This is understandable due to their lack of pace. If you press individually rather than as a unit then teams will often draw you out, pass, and take you out of the game. Therefore, to successfully press, all passing lanes need to be blocked. However, with our full-backs often out of position, Plzen always had a pass available. This meant that the defence chose to keep retreating towards their penalty box, dropping off the opposition in fear they would get in behind them. This gave Horava the time and space to fire in the equalizer.

In the second half, the forced substitution of Aguero led us to playing five in midfield, with Nasri now playing behind Dzeko. He helped the attack perform properly when playing behind the striker, giving Dzeko more to aim for when holding up the ball and giving the wingers more supply than in the first half. He became the hub of the team, placing a nice volley into the net for our second goal.

Pellegrini decided that Nasri needed a rest and as a result we became much more direct. Once the two Sevilla men had been brought on, Navas and Negredo, we looked like playing the conventional 4-4-2 as we had seen in pre-season. Dzeko seemed to pick up his game in the second half and Negredo performed well too, meaning we were holding the ball up much better. A prime example of this was our third goal. From a goal kick, our target men held up the ball before laying it off to Navas to cross, while Negredo charged into the box to slot home. Twelve seconds from Joe Hart to Plzen’s net. 

This led to a 4-2 victory, and while our defence was pretty shaky, the wealth of attacking tactical options we have is incredible. With subtle variations to our players we can vary our style incredibly; with Negredo, Dzeko, Navas and Milner we can play direct long ball football and cross with great effect, with Negredo and Aguero we can punish teams like Tottenham on the counter and with Silva and Nasri we can play the slow build up style we were used to with Mancini. Most top teams have a certain style, for instance United play directly to their wingers and transition quickly from attack to defence. Barcelona are renowned for their slow build up and passing. Yet with City, this game highlighted our ability to adapt the attack to whatever situation we are in.

Transferwise, Currencyfair, etc. are no longer an option (although Transferwise actually stopped doing Bitcoin transactions around April). I have normal UK bank accounts in GBP that I could use to deposit to exchanges, but this involves poor currency exchange rates (either to EUR or USD) and fees. It looks like this is going to be a long-term problem, at least until a decent UK exchange pops up. I'm aware of (and have used) Localbitcoins etc., but I'd really like to be able to get money into an exchange easily for higher frequency trading.

I'm therefore considering opening up a USD bank account in my name here in the UK. I could then deposit in USD directly to exchanges from this account with no currency conversion fees. It would have also have other smaller benefits to me, such as being able to pay my USD server bills without exchange fees. I found a couple of accounts such as this, with no requirement for a US address as far as I can see: [HSBC](http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/current-accounts/international-bank-account), [Citibank](http://www.citibank.co.uk/personal/banking/international/eurocurrent.htm).

My question is: has anybody tried this? I'm wondering if there are any potential problems I've not considered. I guess the main risk is that the account would be shut down once the bank realised I was using it primarily for Bitcoin-related transactions.

He likes the idea, and the special ends shortly after this clip. BBC America posted this promo image and it seems to hint that Smith dies, but Capaldi carries on this mission. I take this to mean that Smith's death results from his effort to find Gallifrey. He must have encountered something that was too hard to fight. Then again, they have hinted that Silence will fall in the Christmas special, so maybe the Silence killed him.

I'm tipping back a few, and feel like this is a good place to do so.

I work at a school, I'm not a teacher, but I do things that teachers do, like mentoring, tutoring, and dealing with behaviour problems. I am in charge of our MIS, and all the student data, and probably know more about our students than a lot of teachers. I'm also in charge of making sure that parents know how their kids are doing, and SMT knowing how well our school is doing.

I recently have implemented some changes (approved) that caused many students to see a 'fail' on their report rather than a 'D-U', as I have changed our BTEC/Vocational courses to match the grades given (Distinction(*), Merit, Pass, Fail). Faculty, and SMT agreed with this, and all felt that it gave a more accurate representation of what is happening. Yay me, because all of my APS and attainment data would be...accurate!

Sent out reports a while back, and parents are complaining that their kids are now showing 'Fail' where they were previously showing a GCSE letter grade - never mind the fact that if their kid wasn't going to pass the BTEC, they wouldn't know until after the course finished, they now see the 'fail'.

I now have to change everything back to a letter grade for reports. I'm working on keeping my accurate reporting internally, but it absolutely infuriates me that rather than accept that their child needs to do more work, parents would rather think everything is ok. Not too mention the work involved in re-doing all that bad data work.

So I guess this leads to the inevitable discussion that goes round in cycles in Doctor Who land... are spoilers good or bad?

Personally, I really like spoilers. I love hunting them out, I love playing them over in my mind and anticipating what the actual end product will be like. I would actually say that spoilers add to my enjoyment of watching, much like reading a book before seeing the film. I've even read whole scripts for films before they've aired and really enjoyed that experience too.

I can understand why some people don't appreciate them, I guess, but in the main spoilers are fairly well hidden away and you have to go through plenty of spoiler warnings before reading in my experience.

Is this a massive issue? Those who like spoilers can read them, those who don't need some self-control to stop themselves reading them?

In the Night of the Doctor, McGann's Doctor is found and healed by the Sisterhood of Karn, who apparently have the power to aid in Time Lord stuff. Now, after the events of the Day of the Doctor, he is no longer living in regret of his past, and he got some of the blocked memories back. My guess is he's going after the Sisterhood to get some answers and a brand new body. 
But to do that he may need to delve into all the horrible weapons and battles of the Time War, contained in the book Clara found in the Library on ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"".

The last trip of that couple, where he knows she's going off to her death, is too emotionally charged to not show, particularly for a heartstring-puller like Moffat. I'm betting that'll come pretty quickly, just so Alex Kingston's arc can be completed and we can move into the new Doctor without having to look back as often. In Forrest of the Dead, River Song goes into detail about the last date she and the Doctor go to Derilium(sic?), where they went to the Singing Towers. She said that, when the Doctor came, he showed up on her doorstep out of the blue with 'a new haircut and a suit'. Now, the Doctor's hair has never really changed all that much for any of the new-Who regenerations, it's hardly a running thing with the character, so I'd almost take that to believe a new regeneration, as I can't see Matt Smith's outfit as a suit, really, just a mix-up of suit-like accouterments. Also, it was then that the Doctor gave her his screwdriver, a screwdriver that we hadn't seen before:

I felt it kind of set us apart.

These days, we can basically say we have 1 regular starter in Hart.
The others are Lescott, Milner and Micah who are all getting very limited game time. Oh and Barry and Sinclair, technically although obviously they are on loan.

Its not a terrible thing, I love our team and players, but it was something that set us apart from the other clubs at the top of the league and I wondered if you guys regretted us going from 5 players in the England team set up, to having the 3rd highest representation in spain's squad for a recent international break.

Spoilers, all that. I've noticed people are extremely curious how saving Gallifrey makes sense. This is how.

-

It is difficult at times to understand time travel. Within fiction however, it can be used to a logical yet paradoxical effect. As long as you respect the tenets of the Prime Time Line. That line is us, or the audience's linear progression through the story. In one story, as well the larger mythos, which is a story in itself. 

This conceit is key to understanding what is officially titled Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special: The Day of the Doctor. It's in the very name. It occurred 50 years into the Prime Time Line into the story of Doctor Who. It's why it happened. 

When the War Doctor first activated the Moment, documented apparently in some audiobook, it did infact commit genocide, end the Time War and he regenerated. This actually happened, as evidenced by Eleven's line by ""Never wanting to see it again."". This likely occurred sometime shortly before the reboot in 2005. So 30-40 some years into the Prime Time Line. When this occurred, the entity known as Bad Wolf didn't exist yet. It just didn't. She occurs later into the Time Line after the reboot's first series, 42 years Prime. 

Bad Wolf is the whovian Deus Ex Machina, which is typically reserved by moving back-to-front, is now moving front-to-back. During the 50th year, by command of Steven Moffat, went back and possessed the Moment's conscience. And basically says so. She does this to save the Doctor, which is why she exists in the first place. His soul, his forgotten face, and his people. And to tell a pretty awesome story. She allows this by letting Ten and Eleven into the time of the Moment's activation:

""We shouldn't be here, these events should be time-locked. Something let us through."" 
""You clever boys.""

By letting Ten and Eleven in, she lets him change his own history, which again is evidenced by an extremely obvious line of dialogue. Bad Wolf is also how the Moment's avatar is apparently capable of opening tears into the fabric of reality, letting the Doctors meet.

However, this doesn't negate the already seven series of the reboot. Since the Moment actually did activate before Bad Wolf's intervention during the 50th year, those episodes are still reflecting a truth. And if revisited, just understood that Gallifrey in fact exists, and one day he'll find it. It's kind of uplifting, actually, to know hope exists for such regretful men who did something horrendous. A paradox to be sure, but logical when held to Prime.

If one imagines all the timey wimey lines of Doctor Who, they'd go everywhere messy. But there is one straight and severely linear line growing alongside the rest, providing it structure. This is the Prime Time Line. It literally explains every little paradox within most Time Travel stories, because they exist in fiction, and the audience through the story creates a Prime Time Line, allowing an exploration through time. Non-structuralists would argue for a non-linear story, but even then, you're starting at one end and ending at another, creating your own version of a Prime Time Line, proving nothing. 

Loose Ends: During it's activation, The Moment's avatar likely reflected a beloved companion of the classic Doctor's. Maybe Sarah Jane or his first, a granddaughter if I remember(?). Since this was just an avatar and not the reality shaping Bad Wolf, she ultimately failed to prevent the weapon's activation.

Because only 13 Doctors exist during the 50th year Prime, that is how many could be conjured by Bad Wolf to save Gallifrey. The Doctor will have a 100th Anniversary and there will absolutely be more than 13 by then. 

If all Doctors saved Gallifrey, wouldn't they always be aware of it through all his regenerations? Again, this event occurs in the 50th year, by will of Bad Wolf Machina, sends for help backward through time. But won't remember such events because they actually occurred long after their earlier existence; ""Our time lines are out of sync."" i.e. out of sync with Prime.

If one wanted to use an earlier Doctor, place him in a story, that would be out of sync with Prime. He would remember these events when he catches up to it in Prime. Again, evident when Five met Ten before the Titanic thing. Literally remembering it as it happened in the Prime Time Line, our progression through the story.

And most obviously this is why Eleven remembers the event, as he's the most recent or Prime Doctor.

Anyways, I could go on about this at some length. I'll stop for now and keep this to an attempted minimum.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,How the 50th Anniversary Special makes sense:,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1rny7f/how_the_50th_anniversary_special_makes_sense/

(DC: Downer Companion, TD: The Doctor)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Doctor and the Downer Companion (#1)

DC: Doctor?

TD: (cheerful) Yes?

DC: All of your past incarnations are still out there, in Time and Space running around in this TARDIS. Now you remember all of those lives and you know that you make it up to this point intact and alive.

But the more you time travel, the greater the statistical probability that you will change something for one of your past self's either directly or indirectly. This could cause an event you remember now as surviving, to one of ultimate destruction. You're like a cat with 12 lives, that can be retroactively aborted.

TD: Meow.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Doctor and the Downer Companion (#2)

DC: Doctor?

TD: (cheerful) Yes?

DC: Why is it that we don't try to save the countless innocent victims of all the many unjust wars? We have the power to travel though space and time, yet all you want to do is go on vacation?

TD: Mahalo!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Doctor and the Downer Companion (#3)

DC: Doctor?

TD: (cheerful) Yes?

DC: You've told me of all your other companions. They become very attached to you, yet have finite and much shorter life spans. Instead of seeing them though to their end, a time commitment off your life most comparable to only 6 months of a human; you give them only long enough until they remind you that time does indeed move forward for everyone else.

Can't you keep me until I'm old and feeble?

TD: Next stop, your future.

It's not something I've ever applied for (or even knew existed the first time; was very confused when it turned up), but it appears in my bank account at the start of every year, I think just for being a student in Wales.

This year I happen to be on jobseeker's allowance, so my question is whether this grant counts as income in their opinion?  Every time I have any small tiny income they seem to try their very best to fuck me out of it so I'm rather worried about what a large incoming payment might mean.  As it stands I can barely afford to feed myself, so I'm growing rather concerned about the potential ramifications of this money.

I'd appreciate it if someone could set my mind at ease.

Why bring the youngsters all the way to Tromso just to have them sit on the bench? They should have been put in after we went up 1-0. Lamela should have never seen the field, McEvoy would've been a far better choice.

*Holtby shouldn't play as a #10. His role is farther back at CM. His pace and energy with his passing makes him a threat as evidenced by the link up between him, gylfi and dembele. 

*Soldado seems to have given up due to getting no service. Even then he was tracking back to help out on defense but the frustration was evident by that yellow card he earned. 

*The team seems to have forgotten what risk is. They always look for the safe pass to retain possession, we forgot how to play a through ball or even try to play one.

*The team needs to fucking cross.

Agree/disagree, your thoughts? There were little flashes of what we were like last year. Utd game whether win or lose will be a benchmark for this season. 

Part 2: Looking ahead to Man Utd.

*Lennon should start on the left and Lamela on the right. Ideally I'd say scrap the whole inverted wingers tactic but if Soldado started today that means Adebayor or Defoe might be starting against Utd, they are much more dynamic so inverted wingers might work. 

*If we are resting Dembele, Paulinho should start if we are struggling Holtby should replace him at ~60 minutes. Gylfi should play #10. 

Win or lose the Utd game is huge. If we win, a win is a win, if we lose I hope we lose at least scoring some lose so we don't seem so fucking incompetent in front of goal.

Russel T. Davies is also well known for creating the show Queer As Folk (UK) so I'm not exactly surprised. But I was wondering if anyone else noticed any of this? I only started noticing when I was a few years older on my second round of watching the series :P

Heres a link where bunch of people have made a list of all references. I personally ignore the ones before the revamp with Eccleston as those references were not deliberate references made by writers.

Does anyone remember any gay references from the Matt Smith run?

Before the season started I thought Man City by far had the best squad with us and Chelsea right behind them.  I still do.  Over achievers will die by the winter if they don't add depth.  I think good things for us. In my weird mind I picture AVB as an idiot savant who I have to believe knows how to tactically dominate the game barring his history of doing just this.  But he is a fucking retard when it comes to players and here is why.


  We benched Hugo Lloris, Frances fucking captain, for what?  10 weeks at least?  Because he had to challenge for his spot?  Our back up keeper is 40 years old, comon man? Hard truth guys, that's an idiotic knee jerk evolution to all the problems he faced at Chelsea.  Worst of all we embraced it.  Hes in form!  AVB so smart making Hugo work for that spot!  And  we made him look like a genius.  Seamlessly man managed that keeper transition. Anyone want to recall how AVB  donated the Europa League by  benching the  worlds top 5 keeper because Brad 'earned it?


  I sort of digress because it may seem like I'm rambling.  But I'm really writing this because of a common theme. We lauded AVB for the injustice he did to Hugo.  And now hes done the same to Erik.  But guess what guys?  It was wrong the first time, we didn't see it, and it is still wrong the second time. But fuck us right? 


  Andros Townsend.  Say that out loud its insane.  Andros Townsend who we loaned to QPR because he could not make our squad a year ago.  Please tell me our manager can actually evaluate our players?  Why is AVB buying into short term results?  So now this predictably goes to shit unlike Hugo, because that's what you get for being results oriented.  And so on here in response we post embarrassing  know it all critiques and ridiculous lineups including 4-4-2 and insanely even 3-x-x-x.  Guys I just think its stupidly simple.  Erik Lamela needed to start since week 1. Even if we lost every game.  And if he flops?  You die with the clubs most expensive signing.

One company I met at a careers fair has started showing an interest in me. They are offering a graduate scheme in a field that I would interested in, however I have a few doubts about whether to keep applying. The company is based a good distance from where I am at the moment, (about a five hour train journey) and I would need to pay for this myself. I may also need to relocate to their location and stay on the scheme for a set period. 

The company has been friendly and looks good, but I have had interviews at places closer to my location. I could potentially afford the travel, but for the price I could be going to half a dozen local interviews instead.  

Basically this seems like a great opportunity, but I'm reluctant to invest the time and money just for a single interview/assessment.

I'm a former season ticket holder whose currently given it up due to relocation, before that i went to many games and some very important ones in our history. 

But i would never presume to tell an overseas fan for example how to behave or act. I also know personally a few Chelsea fans who have been going since the 60's but stopped after Roman because they didn't agree with the direction of the club, they're still as much as Chelsea fans and no one has the right to say otherwise.

We have no say whatsoever on how the club is run really but that hasn't stopped us having our own opinions and its okay to disagree with the club.

Its okay to support Chelsea but feel ashamed of a way a certain player is being treated; for myself not only Mata this season but Malouda being kept in reserves was disgusting. 

Its okay to support Chelsea but to criticise Mourinhio; I think some people have got so caught up in Rafa = Devil, Mou = Saviour that he's beyond criticism, M may say nicer things about us but they were both here for their own ends as all managers are. Its even ok to support Chelsea but to want immediate improvements and call for the sacking of the manger when things go wrong, why not? That's what our owner does. 

Your football club is an emotional investment, from the day you start to the day you die, you change your homes, jobs even wives but you dont change your club. But that club can make mistakes and do things wrong or go in a bad direction or be filled with what you think are useless people and thats when you say for me my club is not what it should be. It's be nice to be fan owned so we could change when we wanted to but we cant so thats why we have places like this to vent our frustration.

Today Mrs dwair is going to venture off toward the bright lights of our distant town later on and decided to pick up a shiny new water tight kettle from a well know catalog store.  Over lunch she boots up her ipad to make a choice and to see what the local store have in stock.  That was over an hour ago. There are hundreds of the things. You can get kettles anywhere between £6 and £125. OK the £6 one will be crap and burn your house down but for fuck sakes £125? on a kettle?  Is £25 too much or to little? It seems like a lot for a bit of plastic but there are others on the site for £50 and they already have £50 off.  

""What do you recon to this one?"" she asks after an hour of browsing.  ""Is it any different to these other two that look exactly the same and cost either £10 less or £30 more?"" say I.  ""Its got a purple light?""

I think a lot of people have this problem and want to get some feedback on a possible solution.

What if there were an app which allowed you to send a message to the postman? This would work because the delivery man would load the postcodes he is delivering to into a computer system (automatically) before each delivery. You just log into the app and send a message. If there is a delivery going out for your postcode the message is sent to the postman (probably as a text message).

For signed packages you could even sign your signature on the screen and it would be sent to the delivery company over the internet.

Would you be interested in an app like this? Any ideas for improvement? And do you think it would even be possible to convince delivery companies to integrate with the system?

Now, on to the title-question:

Moffat has been the executive producer on Doctor Who since 2009. We're closing in on 5 years with him at the helm and in that time we have had great episodes, good episodes, bad episodes, ok episodes and a 50th anniversary special that still boggles the mind. Moffat have written episodes for every doctor since the show was rebooted and many agree that he has written some of the best episoides yet. So why am I asking if it's time for Moffat to give the helm to someone new?
Because with the 50th anniversary special Doctor Who took a huge turn, just like it did with the reboot and like it did when RTD gave up the executive producer to Moffat. The christmas special seems to be where we'll part with Smith and give room for Capaldi (something I am just giddy about, Smith has been a fantastic Doctor but I do look forward to what Capaldi can bring) and the Doctor will take on a new personal quest as a result from the consequenses of the special.
With all this change, could the show benefit from a change of Helm? Could it be that Moffat would serve the show more by giving up his position and going back to being a writer? 

In short; should Moffat give someone new a shot at defining the future of one of the greatest tv-shows in human memory?

ALSO: Please leave out the sexist/homophobic debate. I am aware of it, I have heard some great rational arguments form both sides and this question does not come from this debate, but is a result of what transpires in the special. I will give my outlook if anyone wants, but for now let's keep it at the title-question.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Should Moffat hand over the reins to someone new?,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1rq7sw/should_moffat_hand_over_the_reins_to_someone_new/

I'll begin with the last line from a post Lachiendupape made recently...

""I hope that some see it as it was meant to be, a bit of fun""

Over in CFCUK we have a steadfast rule, praise of Rafa Benitez will not be tolerated. Thanks to an eagle eyed contributor, it was discovered that I broke that rule around 13 months ago. The ground shook, people's perceptions of reality were questioned, my moral judgment was brought in to serious question. It was decided by a jury of my peers that the most suitable punishment would be to write a pro-Rafa, anti-Mourinho article and post it, something that became more fitting following the defeat against Basel this week. I kept my usual subtlety while going about things, used a few of the hot topics that have the community's attention (Lampard, Mata, Luiz) and posted the end result a couple of days ago

The reaction was predictable, to us. While the base material was toeing a line, the comments went over the top frequently and we even discussed reining ourselves in so as to not make the sarcasm tangible. It mattered not, regardless of the absurdity of our statements, they were voted up and agreed with for the most part. A few people stood their ground, some made valid (and obviously correct) points about why Mourinho is a Chelsea hero and Rafa has been confined to a mere mention in our history

The next day there were posts about staying together, what had become of this community, other theatrical pleas for unity or reform. We were about to go ahead and hold our hands up about the previous night's antics and have a discussion about why the points are made sound good to the layman but have no technical/tactical/historical basis, in essence a convoluted educational discussion about the club and some aspects that seem to be held to a lower level of importance than your average Stamford Bridge fan would consider appropriate

This was curtailed by a joke made by Lachiendupape at the expense of a user who submitted a Michael Jackson gif. Lach banned him for 'glorifying a notorious paedophile' or something similar, we found it hilarious as we hoped everybody else would. What followed was embarrassing, ill-mannered and deeply disrespectful to somebody who has put countless (thankless) hours in over the years to better this community. He was here doing his voluntary work before many people reading this were even Chelsea 'fans'. I'm just struggling to accept how people could have taken this seriously, the language and situations that featured in Lach's comments were brilliant but so obviously sarcastic. He claimed children have been made to pleasure Jimmy Saville's 'hot buttery penis' through a popcorn tub in a cinema, for crying out loud. If you take his comments at face value and believed them, then with all due respect it says a lot more about you than it does about him. The messages of hate, calling for his head, insulting him on a personal level (ironically, people I've seen abuse the mods themselves, first) and general lack of awareness was startling

Lachiendupape promptly resigned as a Mod and I'll echo some of his sentiments here. This is not the place many (including myself) hoped it would become over time. If you've followed my contributions here then it's clear I do not post as regularly as before, put simply I got tired of getting messages of abuse, people arguing for the sake of arguing, people having personal digs at me, asking why they should even listen to what I have to say and generally not appreciating that it takes a lot of time and effort to make a long post explaining a subject, much longer than to take a quick picture of this season's home shirt and post it, anyway. I know others who have refrained from detailed posts because nobody appreciated them, frankly it's for the community to call for them if they are desired or missed now. The appetite shifted to these easy, disposable images and comments, everyone had an opinion on the nuances of a tactical formation without even understanding the most basic aspects of it, personal feelings towards individuals took priority over the total sum of the team's parts and it's performance as an XI

This is not a farewell message from me, I still comment every so often and I will make a point of saying that I try and respond to every constructive/questioning message I receive in my inbox. I just thought it best to point out what has been going on here, and publicly express my respect and thanks to Lachiendupape for the fantastic Moderation job he has done in all the time I've been here. Some people should be ashamed at themselves for how they treated him recently. If it needed to be pointed out, he is one of the handful (at most, I assume) people who is older than me and either of us has been a fan for longer than a lot of you have been alive. While that doesn't in itself demand respect or confer authority, we'd appreciate not being spoken to like fucking children, that's a basic modicum of respect that we in turn have extended to you all. Even while Lach was being attacked from all angles, he still kept his cool because it, after all, was a bit of fun. We also respect and commend the work ScreamingGerman has done and as stated in the other thread, he had no idea what we were doing, did not discuss anything with us, nor did he ask Lach to step down. That was his own decision, perhaps his contribution will be appreciated more in his absence

If you took the time to read all that, well done. Do please try and take  a step back every so often and keep an eye on yourself, sometimes it's too easy to get so focussed on one aspect of a situation that you miss the bigger picture, as I suspect happened here

Here is my theory.

I never liked the idea that this was just a representation taken from The Doctors mind. I prefer a more concrete tie-in. So, here it is:

When Bad Wolf appears, she saves the Doctor and ensures her own existence; that is, she plants clues throughout time to make sure that she was brought to this point. The crux of my theory is that she has done the same thing here.

The Ancients invented The Moment and soon learned it had developed a presence. This presence was not unique to The Moment - it was Bad Wolf. When Rose became Bad Wolf, she obtained godlike powers. She used these powers to inhabit The Moment. That was the presence it developed. Maybe it did it at this time to enter the Time Lock, or maybe just to ensure that it would not be used. Whatever the reason, its purpose was to save the Doctor. Once the Warrior obtained the Moment, Bad Wolf orchestrated the events of the 50th. This led to the presence of all 3 Doctors and the plan to save Gallifrey. The Doctor is saved. So what next? It ensures its existence.

The Warrior forgets everything upon regeneration, but the Doctors subconscious drives him immediately to London, before he so much as peeks in a mirror. He finds himself in the basement of a store where he meets Rose and saves her. Thus, the cycle is complete. Bad Wolfs existence is assured and the Doctor is saved.

Reddit is an open forum. If any of you have an issue with the meta side of this subreddit, we implore you to openly address it. I agree our signal to noise ratio has declined over the years, and to discuss ways we can improve /r/chelseafc would be helpful.

In a nutshell. It's increasingly obvious there is a culture clash, but the very essence that makes this place special is the mixture of cultures. Don't forget that.

Perhaps if we gather some feedback we could collectively conduct a solution to prevent future shit-storms.

I'm an absolute beginner (okay, I played some Trombone in the past, but the skills, if I still have any, aren't very transferable).

I'm not looking for free lessons but I do need flexibility - I'm not quite ready to commit long term, plus I'm a student. Ideally, I'd like to get a session or two in over the next couple of weeks so that I can look to a more regular commitment in the next semester. With that in mind, if you're not ready to tutor but think you could share the basics with a newbie, that'd be perfect for me right now. Disclaimer: I don't currently have an instrument (still shopping around) so I'll almost certainly need to use yours on the day.

I'm also in the market for decent but cheap equipment if anyone's looking to part with some. Stuff pops up surprisingly regularly on gumtree though. Rental's also an option but I'm going back to the US for Christmas and don't want to pay for a month of rental when I'm not going to be around.

Let's cut to the chase: a short guide on how to have a better tactical understanding of the game, which will result in discussions of higher quality and hopefully push out the drama.

*Disclaimer: Before I begin, I have to admit to having absolutely no medical degree, hopefully that doesn't make me underqualified.*

**Before the game:**

- For squad news you can read the 'casual' game previews: BBC, SkySports. Please do that instead of posting a ""Where's Luiz?!?!?"" thread.

- For a more insightful tactical preview I highly recommend the game previews over at [WAGNH](http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/). Tim Palmer does a fantastic job of explaining the themes of the game we're likely to observe once it kicks-off. It's indescribably easier to observe things when you know what you're supposed to be observing.

- If you'r looking for specific injury-related info (whether for Fantasy football, or there's a certain absence on the team sheet that you want to know the reason for), the best source is [Physio Room](http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php).

**During the game**:

- For live-statistics there's only one king: [Squawka](http://www.squawka.com/). The live-updated stats they have on their page are nothing short of phenomenal. You can see player heat maps - which spaces they occupy - as well as how they perform in terms of passes, shot accuracy and everything else.

- On that note: I highly advise to follow Squawka on twitter. They post interesting stats and articles. And on that note: I also advise to follow OptaStats. They post interesting stats as well, and their trademark is to finish off the post with a single word followed by a full stop. Ravishing.

- Oh, almost forgot. This doesn't really belong in this section, but as I'm talking about worthy twitter accounts, I have to mention the best one out there: the name is Michael Cox and the account is @Zonal_Marking. He posts his observations live when he notices something during a game. He also has an awesome site, but more about that later.

**After the game:**

- Step 1: 10 deep breaths. We won? That doesn't make Lampard the best player in the world. We lost? That doesn't make Mourinho the worst coach in the world. You get my point? Let's get rid of overreactions. They're cancer for this subreddit.

- Alright, now to the fun stuff. What I like to do immediately after a game is head over - once again - to [WAGNH](http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/) to check out the 'immediate reaction' (that's how the post is always called) of their posters (most often Graham McAree). They're posted ridiculously quickly after a game, and they're a fun read. Their quality is inconsistent - sometimes a nice tactical insight, sometimes moaning about the commentator. Still a fun read after the game. 

- Post-game statistics have the same king as in-game stats: Squawka. I highly recommend you their iOS app they released recently - it's easily the best mobile stats app. Android version coming soon ( :( ).

- My favourite feature of Squawka? Heat maps. They tell you stuff like how wide did Hazard play, how offensive was Ivanovic etc.

- Brace yourself, time for my favourite tactical website. Remember Michael Cox from twitter? Well, here's his site: [Link](http://www.zonalmarking.net/). It takes a while for him to upload a post about a game, and he obviously doesn't post about every single one, but every time he does you can be sure it's a quality read. If you're new to tactics, read [this glossary of terms](http://www.zonalmarking.net/glossary/) first. Michael uses certain vocabulary that can be tricky at first, but it's very easy to get used to it. My recommendation is: read everything he posts there, you learn 
about the insights of the game very fast.

**Book recommendation:**

- Want to increase your tactical knowledge in a more traditional way? My favourite book related to this topic is *Inverting the Pyramid* by Jonathan Wilson.

And that concludes my short guide. I just realized it's not that short - my bad. If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments.

I'm ordering some NHL(hockey) clothes from the states, this is the first time I have ever ordered something from the USA and have some quick questions about customs.

I've ordered two shirts with a total value of $42 which works out at around 25 quid and have paid for expedited delivery at $29. However it states that additional duties and taxes will be charged at time of delivery.

I've had a look on hmrc and found this: 

&gt;Customs Duty
If you're ordering goods from outside the EU, any Customs Duty must be paid by the recipient once the goods have arrived in the UK but before the goods are delivered.
Import VAT
If you're ordering goods from outside the EU, any Import VAT must be paid by the recipient once the goods have arrived in the UK but before the goods are delivered.
In addition, there may also be a handling fee to pay to the carrier. Follow the link below to find out more.
 
Some my question is how much is the likely to cost and how the hell do I pay it? Do they send me a letter and ask for cash or a cheque?

A cool Gary Hooper finish sealed the 3 points for the Yellows in front of the appreciative home fans.

The game started off well for Norwich winning a corner in the first couple of minutes which was delivered by Nathan Redmond, well won by the returning captain Sebastien Bassong but his effort was well wide. However, Norwich had a good case for a penalty as his the Cameroonian's shirt was being pulled to twice his width, but the referee deemed it a fair set piece.

Another good chance came a few minutes later with another set piece, this time a free-kick from Redmond on the right hand side - Elmander tries an ingenious back heel but his effort unfortunately smacked the crossbar. Leroy Fer was unable to get the rebound in from a tight angle. 

The good initial spell from the Canaries culminated in one of the best passing move this writer has seen from them this season. Redmond charged down the right, cuts his pass inside to Elmander who has the vision to get the ball across the box to Hoolahan (who was filling in for the injured wide players today) who opted not to shoot but square it to the free Gary Hooper - who takes a touch the put the ball in a shooting position and finds the bottom right corner to put the Yellows into the lead (30').

From then on, there was not much to shout out as a Canary fan with Palace with the majority of the chances - Bannan, Jedinak and Dikgacoi all having shots well blocked by the Norwich defence, with an outstanding diving header by Olsson to deny Bannan.

The second half was a nervy one for Norwich, with not much possession to begin with and poor touches when they did get the ball. Palace kept the ball well but never really looked like scoring even when they piled the men forward for the last 10 minutes. A particularly ravage scramble was probably their best chance in the game, but it was eventually cleared by Fer and the Canaries were able to see home the game.

A vital 3 points means that manager Chris Hughton can wipe a bit of the sweat off his brow but a very tough mid-week fixture against Liverpool at Anfield and a trip to the Hawthorns to play West Brom on Saturday are to come.

It is my opinion that one of the biggest tragedies of the last century was the failure of the British empire to unify into one coherent federation that transcends the current idea of nation states that we are stuck with just now. It would have put forward the idea that a more unified human planet really was possible. Alas it was not to be.

What is Imperial Federation though? The Imperial Federation League was founded in the late 19th century with branches across the empire and Britian. It predicted that so long as the empire failed to act as a cohesive unit we would be condemned to essentially becoming the bitch of the Unisted States, something that would later prove to be pretty much true. The basis of the federation would be a union between the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (CANZUK) - the nations that would be most game to the idea and would present the least amount of problems and complications. South Africa would also likely be part of such a federation although they had a host of problems in their large Afrikaner (Dutch) population.

What would CANZUK look like today? It would be the largest nation in the world by far, would have a population of almost 130 million, would have the worlds 3rd largest economy, would have the 3rd biggest defence budget and would have a ridiculous amount of potential in the form of untapped resources and room for growth. It's sheer size alone would give it formidable influence on international diplomacy.

Why did it not come about? I would argue laissez faire capatilism was one of the biggest culprits. The greed for short term wealth drove the British government to consistently ignore calls for further empire wide economic integration in the form of Imperial Preference policy (e.g closer trade links between the colonies, tariffs on trade from outside the colonies) and by the time they finally did implement some form of it in the interwar period it was far too late, the rot had set in. More conventional reasons also include the growth of 'colonial nationalism', WW1, representation issues and of course the sheer distances involved.

Despite those issues I do not believe there was anything decisive standing in the way of such a union aside from politicians short sightedness which is why I consider it such a tragedy. Although our chances of unification are long gone i would still one day hope to see some form of real economic, diplomatic and cultural co-operation between the commonwealth nations. We are so similar and have so much shared history that I think it is a great waste not to make use of such links.

Question time!
1. Do you think Imperial Federation would have been a good thing? Do you think it could have been achieved?
2. If a CANZUK nation was on the menu today would you support Britain joining it?
3. A more realistic scenario - Would you support our politicians trying to foster closer economic and political ties with the commonwealth or would you prefer to stick with the European path?",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,"British Empire, Imperial Federation, Commonwealth Co-operation",10,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1rshzn/british_empire_imperial_federation_commonwealth/

I can't say that loud enough. I love this man as much as any other Blues fan out there, and I can't think of a better person to manage our team. But, the man seriously does some things I'm not fond of, and while to the outside world (i.e /r/soccer) I'll pretty much stand by anything he does or keep my mouth shut, I think this is a safe place to criticize some of his actions without actually criticizing the man.

I'll start. [This](http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/29/jose-mourinho-hits-out-at-talkative-romelu-lukaku-4207287/) whole Lukaku controversy is just infuriating.

I'm clearly a fraud. Highest overall score has been 38. Don't think I'll make that black chair just yet.

I wonder what Magnus Magnuson is up to these days? Similarly Edward Woodward. Now, what are &lt;&lt;&lt; those sorts of names called? I know there is a word for them. 

Speaking of films, do any of you have any ideas for a December /r/Ijustwatched gold competition? It needs to be relatively easy as most people are full of can'tbearsedness but I don't completely want to give my money away without some sort of effort. 

I've had some unusual crush moments in the last week. [Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165798/?ref_=nv_sr_1) - clearly I wouldn't fancy him playing [Idi Amin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455590/?ref_=nm_knf_i2), although I highly recommend the film, and [Peter Ginn](http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/columnists/arts/tonightstv/10114167.Wartime_Farm_Christmas__BBC2__9pm_/) who is back on the telly with yet another stupid farming programme (it was nothing to do with the codpiece, it's all about technique and not size dahhhlinks, right?). Apart from telling us about his bowel movements, his overall demeanour just does it for me.  Forest? Well there was a moment with a side profile when his upper lip looked so damn cute. Uhh. It's the little things? 

Also, I decided to attack my unruly eyebrows (which I've been trying to groom to perfection for two months and failing) with my bikini trimmer, the results of which are lolsome. No, I am not posting pictures. But chuffing 'eck nouser, when was that *ever* going to be a good idea? 

Just in case you think recent Christmas no. 1s have been shit, I'd like to present [Grandma We Love You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIkSeUmzrs) to you, which I sadly not only remember, but remember singing to.

I am a long time lurker, first time poster to let me first say this is a great sub-reddit with useful info &lt;3

So I am just trying to figure out which out of

https://localbitcoins.com/ and
https://bitbargain.co.uk/ 

has the highest volume of traffic moving through them.

Bitbargain made this statement:

&gt; ""November 27, 2013
&gt; New Record
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday: 1161 sales, 79 sellers, 841 buyers. Sold 150.73 BTC @ &gt; &gt; 716.61 GBP average, in total 108,012.12 GBP, average markup 97.65 &gt; GBP. Sold 5,353.02 LTC @ 23.34 GBP average, in total 124,912.71 &gt; &gt; GBP.
&gt; Today was not only a new record in volume and sales, but more &gt; litecoins have been sold than bitcoins.

&gt; The total comes to 232,924.83 GBP worth of coins. In 24 hours. &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably a record number of seller applications too (69).""

I am having trouble selling anything on local bitcoins because to get anywhere near the first page I would have to sell at an unprofitable rate since I have a low amount of trades and it appears this is taken into account when ordering listings.

Bitbargain seems to order by price as default so I am wondering if I jump through their hoops (register on IRC, pass the test, pay the fee) then will I be able to sell there at a higher or lower rate than local bitcoins.",false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,null,null,self,Bitbargain vs LocalBitcoins Volume of trades,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinUK/comments/1rt6f6/bitbargain_vs_localbitcoins_volume_of_trades/
