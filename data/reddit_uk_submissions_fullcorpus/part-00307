[The Eleventh Doctor Meets The Curator](https://youtu.be/1cbQVfVfSrI) 

[Transcript:](http://www.chakoteya.net/doctorwho/33-15.html)  

DOCTOR: I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be the Great Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be the curator of this place. 

CURATOR: You know, I really think you might. 
(Yes, that is the current silver haired version of the fourth Doctor you just heard. There's Tom Baker, leaning on a walking stick.) 

DOCTOR: I never forget a face. 

CURATOR: I know you don't. **And in years to come, you might find yourself revisiting a few.** But just the old favourites, eh? 
(The Doctor winks.) 

CURATOR: You were curious about this painting, I think. I acquired it in remarkable circumstances. What do you make of the title? 

DOCTOR: Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls. 

CURATOR: Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong. It's all one title. Gallifrey Falls No More. Now, what would you think that means, eh? 

DOCTOR: That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there. 

CURATOR: I'm only a humble curator. I'm sure I wouldn't know. 

DOCTOR: Then where is it? 

CURATOR: Where is it indeed? Lost. Shush. Perhaps. Things do get lost, you know. And now you must excuse me. Oh, you have a lot to do. 

DOCTOR: Do I? 
CURATOR: Mmm. 

DOCTOR: Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey? 

CURATOR: Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice, eh? I can only tell you what I would do if I were you. **Oh, if I were you. Oh, perhaps I was you, of course. Or perhaps you are me. Congratulations.** 

DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 

CURATOR: **Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way. Who knows, eh? Who knows?** 

So I've gotten into some arguments lately about who the Curator from *The Day of the Doctor* is, so I decided to write down my fan theories.

So what are the most likely outcomes? 1. He is just a Human, possibly the face the Doctor was inspired by years early for the forth Doctor 2. He is the forth Doctor using the Chameleon Arch 3. He is a future incarnation of the Doctor 4. He is the fourth Doctor. 

1. Nah, he knows too much about the Doctor

2. Maybe, but he also knows a lot about the Doctor and Gallifrey and why would he need to do that? The arch could de-age him...

3 and 4 are the most likely given the conversation, but why would they consider making a future Doctor a used face and actor? We do want 50 more years, right? Like it or not, we only have one Tom Baker and he's a bit... old.

So I settled on theory 4. He is the fourth Doctor. So how is he so old? We've seen the Doctor age noticeably (one way or another) in the past (1, 2, 5, 8, War, 10, 11) and of those 2, 5, 10 and 11 have aged and de-aged. 11 de-aged through regeneration.  10 de-aged through the power of believing in fairies. 5 was older in *Time Crash* and as 10 says, ""The two of us together has shorted out the time differential. Should all snap back in place when we get you home."" 2 was older in *The Two Doctors*, I have no idea how he de-aged, can someone who has seen the episode tell me?
If it wasn't specific circumstances like the others, this could apply to 4 as well. 

So how does this fit into the plot? Lets jump to 12 now. We all wonder what he is calculating on his chalk boards, don't we. It has to do with finding Gallifrey, doesn't it? What if it doesn't have to do with finding Gallifrey, but being there to save it in *The Day of the Doctor*, all attack eyebrows and ""No sir, all thirteen"". Why would he be there if his passed incarnations did all the work for him.  If 11 truly new he was the last regeneration, his plan may not have accommodated for another Doctor. What could 12 possibly need to do other than go there as part of his search for Gallifrey? Maybe he created something to send to Gallifrey to signal out through time. 

12 follows the signal and lands the TARDIS and steps out, expecting to see those burn auburn skies again, only to find himself in a quiet art gallery with white walls and tan wood floors, right in front of the 3D Time Lord painting ""Gallifrey Falls, No More"". A moment of confusion is slowly wiped as the Doctor walks toward the painting, realizing that the painting itself is Gallifrey trapped in a single moment, like, well, a painting, just like the past Doctors planned. He takes the painting down from the wall, only to revival a smaller cubby behind it. Inside the cubby are three items, a large brown coat, a large floppy fedora, and a absurdly long, multi-colored scarf. 

12 steps back a bit, the painting under his arms. He looks back and sees to old face, yet still so familiar, of the Curator. He says nothing, only taps his nose twice with a twinkle in his eye. 12 gives a small nod of approval and says, ""You need a new scarf"". He steps into the TARDIS and it dematerializes. 

The Curator grabs the articles of clothing and walks past the [round things in the gallery](http://blog.neoncompass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1-inspiration-1.jpg). Walks into a room and we enter the old console room he puts the coat and the scarf on his skin glows slightly yellow, akin to regeneration. We focus on his face and he put the fedora on and as it is place on his head, it is his young face (Just go with it)

On 12's TARDIS we see him send a message back to the fourth Doctor.

This site offers HD (little to no buffering) streams for every football game for ~10 USD a month.  It also comes with channels such as sky sports 1 2 5, BT sports, ESPN,  NFL network, etc (more listed on the website) 


It has support for mobile devices,  Kodi,  Apple TV,  and others.

I was skeptical at first,  this is a VERY good alternative to free online streams if you're willing to pay a few bucks a month. 

Though I should warn you,  this is in no way ""legal"". Same rules apply as they do to any other 3rd party online streams. 

For someone who lives in Canada and isn't willing to pay hundreds of bucks a year just to catch games on different channels,  this is an amazing find. I was able to watch Coutinho's screamer in HD for once haha!

I started watching about a month and a half ago but stopped for a bit. I've spent the last 2 weeks binging through and there is just so much I want to discuss. 


I loved all the Doctors. Eccleston was my favorite only because he was my first. Tennant was brilliant. I loved the charm he brought to the character. Smith, he's my least favorite of the new ones but I still find his acting great and his dark storylines were incredible. Capaldi, I'm growing on Capaldi. I love the intensity he brings in character. He's like a goofy, cranky old man, love it.


Companions, Rose Rose Rose. I loved me my Rose Tyler. I liked her side stories. Her farewell to the Doctor was heart wrenching. Saddest departure of the show for me. Martha... Was OK. I didn't dislike her, but didn't think she was particularly great. Donna was a hit and miss for me. Sometimes I felt her character felt a little forced, but I did enjoy her quite a bit. Now Amy, I'm not sure how the sub feels about her, but I felt she was the star of the show in the Smith era(not in a good way). The two things that balanced her out were Rory. He was a great character. The Centurion who waited. Loved that. And River Song. Her whole arc was pretty solid. I'm enjoying Clara's run. She's a quick witted quick thinking little badass. And although not a companion, freaking Captain Jack. I loved every moment he was on this show. I'm a fan of Torchwood and Arrow, Barrowman is badass.


There is so many great episodes. Some of my faves were 


-The empty child


- The parting of the ways


- School reunion


- Love and monsters


- The three episode arc to finish season 3


-Silence in the library


- The stolen earth


-The end of time


-Vincent and the Doctor(my favorite)


-The Doctors wife


- A good man goes to war


- Asylum of the Daleks


- The name, the day and the time of the Doctor were really good episodes


- The caretaker


- Kill the moon


Overall the enemies were pretty frightening. Daleks, Cybermen, the Master, the Silence were my favorites. Except *ahem* the wooden Cybermen. 


I was very impressed overall. This has certainly been a roller coaster of emotions for me and I love that. As the Doctor would say... Fantasssstic!

A few months back, various events were set in motion to bring Portland it's 1st official CIA Chapter. It's a little wierd that ""Soccer City USA"" didn't have one prior, but oh well who give a flip.

Now that the 2015-16 campaign is underway, I'd like to once again give a shout out to ALL in the PORTLAND metro who KTBFFH. Stumptown Blues just started meeting at Blitz Ladd off SE 11th Ave in Downtown, and also have a smaller following at Highland Stillhouse, for those who live closer to Oregon City.

If you live in the area, or just want to join another Chelsea friendly social group, please feel free to reach out to an Admin on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/StumptownBlues/) Group Page.

That's one more educated guess than I'll ever get so here goes :*

I'm from Romania. Don't throw rocks at me, I wasn't born here and I don't intend to stay. I'm currently starting my final year of HS and should file my application by October 15th, and I just started preparing.

I like computers. No really, that's about all I do and all I've done everyday for the past years. Programming/Designing, gym, go out. Computer Sciences is my only choice, no doubt about that.

I'm a web designer/developer. I make things look good/actually work for small sums of money that in turn buy me food/rent/etc. Does this count as experience? Having worked at various agencies, freelancing, and now owning my own business?

I recently won an open-source international programming contest hosted by Google ( 700 participants ) and got a trip to SF/Mountain View. Is that something I should mention, would it get me anywhere?

I have had a lot of maths/informatics academic results in the years prior to highschool, but I apparently can't mention that. Am I screwed?

Now, apparently Oxford has 22 spots for my kind. I am loaded up on redbull and consultant fees so hopefully I'll get a good application in that would get me to the interviews. Here's when stuff gets real.

Oxford has a list of sample questions on their website, with only one being given the correct answer. The rest are up to your best guess, and some questions don't have an answer on google search. That's why I skyped an old friend of mine that currently studies at Cambridge and we went over the questions over the duration of last night. Some are still unanswered so I'm going to try to make this concise ( please do tell me if something is wrong ), I'm just going to post results, for in-depth discussion message me saying you have an interest since I feel like I'm writing way too much ( questions [here](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ugadmissions/how_to_apply/sample_interview_problems.html) ):

1. 97.

2. Approaching it ""binary search""ish would always yield good results : you ask for f(0) and f(1), then for f(0,5). You then query f(0,25) and f(0,75) and see which half you should be looking into, keep doing that for the rest of your tries.

3. This is by far the hardest problem on that list. We came up with a bunch of generalizations, rules and exceptions, but no smart way to solve this problem besides splitting it into a million tiny problems and cases. Is this the way to go?

4. white.

5. ways of arranging 5 2's and 0 1's + ways of arranging 4 2's and 2 1's + ways of arranging 3 2's and 2 1's+.. google says that the answers follow fibbonaci but my solution should work too.

6. O ( N ) is the best we could get. Is that it?

7. I fell asleep working on this one, don't have an answer.

Basically I don't fell ready. I have to pass initial shortlisting ( based on letter and CV - which consists more or less of me freelancing, winning a google competition and starting my business ). If that somehow happens, I have to take the MAT and do well, then I have to pass the interviews. If I do get through all of that I then need to get a very high grade in Romania's version of baccalaureate ( which is flawed at every step and without any chance of retribution ).

Honestly, is there any way I'm going in? Just want to know whether there is at least 1% of me passing through all of this so I can justify hundreds of hours of work. Is there anyone here who got into Oxford with a worse CV than mine?

Regards,

Marc

I'm not so familiar with the IGCSE, so I have a few questions if you don't mind answering. I'm teaching the A and B levels for English. 

1.  In the curriculum, it says students will have to know texts like ""Touching the Void"" and ""Taking on the World."" Do students have to read the whole novel, or just the selection in the text book?

2. How often did your class meet? Mine is scheduled to meet every day for about 45 minutes (the students all have pretty good English). 

3. Is there anything you wish your teacher had done differently? Anything you wanted them to focus on more? Did you feel they prepared you adequately for the test?

Thanks for all your input! I want to give my students the best chance they have at passing the exam.

I have an offer from a really good university - but sort of snuck in as they had spaces left after initially being rejected (so I didn't need an interview/portfolio!). This is also the last year of getting a maintenance grant as opposed to a loan. ehh.

 I'm not sure my heart is in it; over the last few months i've found out that programming is really fun to me *and* compsci has decent job prospects; and I'm seriously considering taking a gap year off doing an apprenticeship before applying for uni again. I would've taken the subject at A level if my college had offered it (it does the year after I get there - the bastards). My A levels will be in Media, Film and English Language so my subjects hardly lean that way (although I got an A in gcse maths which seems to be my saving grace for apprenticeship applications). I'm super excited at all the options available to me, but it has been a stressful week.

 I ask; how did you guys decide what to do in life? It seems I cannot seperate hobbies from career prospects - computer science is much broader than programming and i'm partially concerned that i'll fall out of love with it, not that i'd have to stop the second it got stressful. Film production has terrible job prospects and I think i'm more interested in writing about films or screenwriting - both of which would make good hobbies (I wrote a TV review which I enjoyed doing the other day). Whilst this is partially stressful, I am yearning for productivity after a fairly empty summer. I'd love to hear anyone elses advice, relevant stories etc! thanks. 

For reference on my indecisiveness- i've always been interested in writing and I was praised for that more for any than my film related work, nearly taking this to a university level in some form. Obviously, that is hard to be monetized so that is low priority (sorry - satrical stories I wrote a year ago that are now cringe inducing). Whilst in a miliband enduced trance for a few months I nearly considered taking politics and international relations after a gap year instead, too. Even journalism... maybe. Hell, I nearly got a job through my dad at one point - but decided I wanted to be able to say I done things myself and do something I like. I am so securely middle class that I have all these options and a safety net of my parents - with no idea about how to take risks. now i'm rambling! thank you for reading if you did.

tl;dr: do I go to uni for film or take a gap year and get the relevant qualification for a computer science degree? I also have gained too many interests; of which I have too much time to think about in regards to which ones I should make careers and which I should make hobbies.

Along with what seemed like the rest of America, I got caught up in the World Cup Fever last year and it ignited this newfound passion for football. When the tournament ended, I was told that I needed to follow the sport at the highest level in order to keep the fire alive. As an American who has no emotional connection to any club in England, I found this too difficult a task to take up at the time. I decided to follow my domestic league (MLS) and my local team (Portland Timbers) and I now consider myself an ardent, well-read supporter. With the beginning of a new Premier League season, I decided that I should wade into this new level of my relationship with football and choose a club to follow as best an American on the Pacific Coast can.

I chose Manchester City because, from the outside looking in, it is not part of the traditional Big 4 and therefore is not too much of a bandwagon choice. Also, I didn't want to follow mid to low table clubs because that's like asking a European kid who has a newfound interest in basketball to follow a small market team with which the kid has no emotional attachment to like the Orlando Magic or the Portland Trailblazers. You want him to watch San Antonio Spurs or early 2000s LA Lakers. On a shallow level, City's kit is sick as fuck and I dig the sky blue. On an interesting level, City's Women is chock-full with England WWC players (Houghton, Bardsley, Duggan) who I came to love during their great run in Canada. I don't expect to follow the Women but as a fan who has recently become endeared to his local women's team (Portland Thorns) and the domestic women's league (NWSL), I respect a club that participates in the advancement of women's football.

This is all just a long winded way of introducing myself, expressing my enthusiasm on this the eve of a new season for City, and asking what I should know about what I'm getting into by pledging allegiance to this club.",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,New Supporter Introduction,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/3gftrj/new_supporter_introduction/

Anyway, i need to get the windscreen replaced very shortly as there is a large crack in the driver's side and the MOT is due later this month.  I called the glass company and when i told them that it was an '09 Mitsubishi Colt CZ1 (3-door hatch), they asked if it was the new '09 or the old '09 model (apparently 2009 was the year they changed the shape).  Obviously this will affect whether or not the replacement windscreen will actually fit or not.

Now, i have no clue about cars in general and am therefore unsure of whether this is a new or old '09 Colt.  I was told that the newer model wouldn't have any bumber strips on the doors (mine hasn't, as far as i can tell).  However, yesterday i happened to notice an '11 plate Colt that i thought had a slightly different shape to mine so now i'm unsure which one i have.

Took a picture of the bike when I got to work this morning. The white parallel stripes going through the ""H"" are what I assumed to be damaged paint: http://i.imgur.com/0yYqI1M.jpg

Got out of work and rode home; the stripes were gone. Completely gone. This was the tank when I got back: http://i.imgur.com/onvLTwH.jpg

I'm very confused. The white stripes had no surface to them (it wasn't like say, bird shit, which could be scratched off with a barely abrasive surface like the finger of a glove) and wasn't raised up - no part of it would budge no matter what I did this morning. It reminded me of dried on candle wax or the kind of residue you get when filling up at the pump by appearence alone, but you couldn't ""chip"" any part of it away, so I naturally assumed paint stripped as I had played with the front reservoir the day before.. But it looks like they just seem to have disappeared as the day went on (and consequently, the tank dried out from its drenching this morning). Really, really bizarre..

**Original:**
So /r/MotoUK, in true muppet fashion, I got some brake fluid on my tank and let it dry. There is now two nice long, white parallel lines running down the side of my tank. The DOT4 has stripped it.

My question to you guys is for those who have used touchup pens or paint, what are your experiences? Worth doing it? Did you have to sand down the surface first and then apply or could you apply directly to the affected area? Thinners, primers etc - the whole ordeal sounds very foreign to me..

I have the color codes for my bike but unfortunately it has affected the two-tone tank pattern, so I may need to get a bit creative.",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,Paint = stripped,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/3gfyal/paint_stripped/

I'm having some trouble understanding what is going on with my credit score/reports. 

I signed up to the free trial with Experian last year as I was about to apply for a balance transfer. My credit score was good to excellent and my application for a Post Office MasterCard and balance transfer was successful and in the last year I have managed to pay off my £4000 debt. I still hold the cards and use them and pay them off fully, no longer carrying a balance.

I am about to go leave the UK for a few months (to the USA and New Zealand) and so last week I went into Halifax to apply for the Clarity credit card.  However, before doing this I tried to view my free credit score on Noddle and Equifax but neither could validate me and Experian wanted me to pay £14.99 to sign back up. Naively, based on what I had achieved in paying off my credit cards and knowing that I had no outstanding or issues with debt or money, I went ahead and did the application with Halifax and to my surprise I was refused - but of course no information given as to why or how to fix it.

Cue me worrying about there being some fraud or something I didn't know about killing my credit.  Still Noddle and Equifax couldn't identify me so I bit the bullet and signed back up to Experian, knowing that they had my details already.  I get on to Experian and my score is 999/999... so now cue me being dumb founded as to what is going on and feeling something is off.  I check the details and everything is there except my Post Office credit card, despite there being the credit check from the Bank of Ireland noted in the search history. After a bit of research I find out the Bank of Ireland doesn't share information with Experian so know I assume that this is where the problem lies.

I don't know what changed but eventually I was able to get to a point with Equifax where I had to call with a reference and to complete my registration.  I did this this morning and logged on to Equifax following the call and find out that my score with them is 326/999!? But Equifax shows and tells me that I have never had any credit agreements and have no credit history and hence the low score, so I don't believe this score either.

Noddle still won't let me sign up.

I am at a loss as to how to figure out what is going on and how to fix it.

TL:DR Experian has all but one of my credit accounts and gives me a credit score of 999, Equifax has none of my credit accounts and gives me a score of 326. 

Please, UKPersonalFinance, help me figure this out what is going on and solve my confusion as to why neither show my entire credit history?

I know I shouldn't be impressed by that, but I was.

He's dressed like a geography teacher, with his pens ever present in the top pocket. Again - how incredibly refreshing to see someone who looks 'normal'.

The talk was in a kurdish community centre - which was fantastic. For one, I've never attended 'a community event' in my home town since I moved there, and all of a sudden there's a room packed full of people from every background waiting to hear from a guy who's going to champion them.

In short, he was excellent. Never for a moment could you sense any sort of spin or insincerity. He seemed genuinely to be an activist looking for real positive change. He didn't dodge questions, he was forthright about his policies. 

He wants to renationalise the trains - why should the public pay for infrastructure then profits derived by that be privatised? Socialism for infrastructure, private business for profits. I think that's incredibly refreshing to hear.

His opinions on that topic spread to the energy companies too - we paid for the infrastructure, why shouldn't we benefit from the profits directly? He said the same thing of the banks - they should have been nationalised with a mandate to invest in business and infrastructure which is beneficial to all of society, why are they locking up capital to plug holes in dodgy lending at the expense of the public?

Unfortunately, he only really got to speak for about 45 minutes, and much of that talk was about the community we were in. I would have liked to delve deeper into the policy side of things but perhaps I can do that again sometime in the future!

He's got my vote anyway - I want to see a *real* opposition to neo-liberalism, and he's definitely our best option for that right now.

I am *not* some Labour plant, I'm just doing my bit. I just joined labour so I can vote on his nomination:

I made a four-figure loan to a friend of mine in April 2013, as she was setting up a business and struggling to pay some monthly personal expenses. We agreed it would be short term to tide her over. Foolishly, I did not draw up a contract - a valuable lesson I have learned!

While the friendship was sound I did not make any attempts to chase it, and my friend acknowledged sheepishly in Jan 2014 that she still wanted to pay me back. She apologised for talking about a holiday (if that had been foregone presumably she would have been able to repay it sooner).

In Jan 2015 she seems to have lost contact with me, though we move in similar circles, so I've bumped into her a few times. I kept my counsel about the various ignored social messages I had sent her. At the start of May 2015 I started to get in touch with her again, and to chase the loan. She ignored me for months (around 10 messages in text/voicemail/email etc) and finally I had to send recorded delivery final demands to her office and home addresses, setting a deadline for Small Claims court action in August.

She replied _on_ the deadline (last week) saying that she would repay the sum owed by the end of October. There was no explanation as to why she has lost touch, nor why it has been so painful to chase the loan. I replied with a payment schedule with a new reply deadline, noting these sums for repayment:

* Principal sum
* Interest at 2% simple terms
* Cost of registered letters to chase debt

She replied (again within hours of the deadline) to say that she'll repay the principal sum only. Thus, not only is the loan operating at a loss, but the costs of sending registered letters put me out of pocket. She says that she cannot agree to the payment schedule I have set.

I am tempted to go to the small claims court for the principle of the thing, but the amount now in dispute is relatively small - about £60. I understand that court action will cost me about £70 online, the cost of which can be passed to my friend if I win. I think I have a strong case, and I feel let down. I have kept excellent records. Will the court be unimpressed that I am effectively claiming for a sum similar to the cost of bringing the case? I think it is important, but I would understand if they were to see it as trivial.

---

Edit: two very helpful folks have said below I cannot retroactively apply an interest rate, even if it is only to prevent the loan operating at a loss. Given that my friend has sabotaged every attempt I've offered to understand why the short term loan has become a long one, and has been incommunicado until threatened with court action, then faced with two separate deadlines for reply has replied only on the last possible day in each case, then has rejected my suggested payments schedule and wishes to repay at her leisure, I am still mulling court action. I would effectively be chasing for the principal sum, court fees, and about £10 in registered mail costs - and seeking a strict payment schedule. I cannot be sure she won't default on her own October deadline, sadly.

I probably need someone to say it's too trivial to bother with, but I'm willing to risk the court fees to illustrate that treating people badly has consequences.

---

Edit: after reflecting on how long the loan has been going on for, and the length of my friend's estrangement whilst I was asking her to get in touch, I sent a lengthy negotiation email setting out where I was willing to compromise, and asked her to do the same. It seems to have worked - she has now sent me an acceptable counter-offer, and court is avoided for now! Thanks to all respondents.

Perhaps Labour can find it's own theme of fixing unpopular government moves of selling off public services over the past few decades. 

Since privatisation, train prices and utility bills have shot up far above inflation while the companies running them have made big profits.

So here comes the tricky situation:

From what I understand HMRC believes he came over to the UK to die and therefore any inheritance should have full tax paid on. Apparently (although I'm not fully clued up on this matter) because my uncle is an executor of the will (not my aunt or father) he must sign a document to confirm that he did not intend to live here and then the matter is resolved. 

My uncle has never done this even when pressured by my father. 

My grandfathers house was worth about £2 million and there are 6 grandchildren (and I know its all split between us) so this would be a significant sum to get started in life but has been tied up in this legal situation for over 12 years.

the script.[26][27] In October 2013, Simon Kinberg was hired to co-write and produce the film.[28]
In January 2015, Marco Beltrami was hired to compose the film's score.[53] Philip Glass was also hired to 
work on the score with Beltrami.[9] Additionally, American hip-hop recording artist El-P scored the end credits 
of the film.[54] To promote the film, Kim Nam-joon, known as Rap Monster of the Kpop group Bangtan Boys, and 
American recording artist Mandy Ventrice, worked on the digital single ""Fantastic"", which was released alongside 
the South Korean run of the film.[55] In July 2015, Beltrami attended the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International 
to discuss scoring the film. Beltrami described the score as ""eerie"" and ""mysterious"", landing it in a ""musical 
territory leaning towards fantasy.""[56] The film score will be released on August 14, 2015 by Sony Classical 
Records.[57]was moved to Louisiana due to the state's film production tax incentives.[46] In January 2015, reshoots for the 
film were ordered by 20th Century Fox executives who were not satisfied with the film, and the cast and crew 
members went back to the Louisiana set to carry out the reshoots.[47][48]
In the United States and Canada, Fantastic Four was projected to take the top spot and earn around $40–50 million in its opening weekend, which would be lower than the opening weekend gross of 2005's Fantastic Four ($56.1 million) and 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer ($58.1 million).[3][71][72][73] It made $2.7 million from late night previews on the night of August 6.[74] On its opening day, Fantastic Four earned an estimated $11.3 million (including Thursday's preview screenings), lower than early tracking,[75] and an estimated $26.2 million on its opening weekend, marking one of the lowest openings of all time for a big-budget superhero movie which box office analysts have attributed to poor critical reviews and audience reception. It came in second place behind Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.[76] When asked to comment on the weekend box office results, Chris Aronson, Fox's president of domestic distribution said: ""There's not much to say. I have never seen a confluence of events impact the opening of a movie so swiftly,"" referring to negative reviews and a renegade tweet by Trank that blamed the studio for the poor reviews.[70] Its low financial performance has been described by Adam B. Vary of BuzzFeed as a box office bomb.[77]

Outside North America, it grossed $34.1 million on its opening weekend from 43 countries, coming at second place behind Rogue Nation at the international box office. While it underperformed in certain countries, it opened at number one in 20 countries. Its top openings were in Mexico ($5.15 million), the U.K., Ireland and Malta ($4.15 million) and France ($3.78 million).[78]

**Key initial findings from this:**

**[There are similarities between both subreddits in many respects, results hyperlinked in from r/ukpolitics here;](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3gcccv/results_from_rukpolitics_political_party_vote/)**

Firstly, in **Labour being less popular than one would have expected statistically.** As mentioned in r/ukpolitics, this could be due to the fact that Labour are not as left wing as they used to be or, because they are facing a difficult time right now and leadership questions to be had, there is a potentially transient decrease in Labour ""supporters"" right now. 
Of course feel free to comment on your opinions and explanations etc for this there is no concrete explanation on why these results are how they are.

**Liberal Democrats were very successful in both polls.**

**The Conservatives were the least represented as a proportion in both polls, with the Greens being the most represented proportionally in both subreddits.**

**Differences:**

Firstly it would appear that [r/ukpolitics] has a slightly more representative subscriber pattern based on the proportions you would expect to find vs the general electorate. On r/unitedkingdom there is a very clear left wing slant, on r/ukpolitics it is far more subtle and while still evident with misrepresentation of the Tories and almost equal UKIP, it is not as large as r/unitedkingdom where there is a very clear pattern emerging. All of the left wing parties were over represented with all of the right wing parties less represented.

**UKIP were a 1.26X in r/ukpolitics but really struggled here at 0.47.**


I hope that you found that interesting and on the face of it, it would suggest that everybody, on both sides of the political spectrum be careful with downvoting or the nature of comments because there is a clear potential to make discussion quite difficult at times for the less represented parties. That said, we often see that in real life with the media but for reddit to be a better place for discussion than the media which will nearly always focus on the big 2, reddit could be a much better place than the media for these reasons. This last part is just my opinion and is based on no facts at all but just a closing statement from what I thought and feel free to comment on whether the results were expected, surprised you or anything at all!

I need to get a few bolts made for a door handle in my office. The company who originally supplied them no longer exists, and no-one in any hardware store (Wickes, B&amp;Q, etc.) has ever seen anything like it.

I have one bolt left to use for specs and as an example, but need 10-12 doing. At the minute I'm being left stumped by the various companies I've found that do make custom bolts, as they either can't do it, or will only do 10,000+ of them, which is overkill for this situation.

I'm really struggling here. I can't even find the right thing to look for in terms of a small business that may be able to just use something like a CADCAM machine to make a handful for me. Any ideas are gratefully accepted, I'm losing my mind trying to find something!

It seemed obvious to me that the game plan was to keep it tight and not concede for the first 60, setting up with a medium to low block in two banks of 4, and then pushing for a win in the last 30 by switching to a midfield three and putting heavy pressure on Stoke, opening the game up to a greater extent with Can allowing Milner and Henderson to push forward, pressing and supporting the attack.

**0-60**

 I was pleased by how well we kept our defensive shape defending in two banks of four, due to disciplined, controlled play, something that I hope continues into this season. For the first 60 minutes, our play without the ball was as good as I have seen it under Rodgers. Stoke were limited to a few set-pieces and crosses from deep which were for the most part dealt with comfortably by our defence. The occasions that gave me jitters were all caused by Stoke pumping diagonal balls to Walters in an attempt to catch Gomez out, a strategy that waned in effectiveness as Gomez eventually got the upper hand over Walters.

Unfortunately on the ball in this period we were sloppy, failing to create much of note and frequently gifting possession to Stoke, who were able to retain it in the backline comfortably due to our reluctance to press. They were unable to build much from the back so the willingness to cede possession to them in those situations proved to be wise although it will cost us if used in our away games against stronger opposition. 

Our inability to retain possession and 'rest on the ball' as Rodgers has always talked about is concerning, due to Skrtel and Mignolet's obvious discomfort on the ball. With Mignolet as keeper we will never be able to play a possession based game as we are playing with one man less against a high press effectively. Benteke was left isolated and we found it difficult to play through Stoke's midfield, instead opting to use him as an aerial outlet to mixed success: while Benteke did a good job at challenging and winning most of the aerial balls played to him he was often too isolated for his headers to reach one of our players. Hopefully our possession play improves as the season goes on although again, with Mignolet in goals it can only do so to a certain extent

**60-90**

The introduction of Can saw us shift towards a more aggressive, front-footed approach. Can sitting allowed Henderson and Milner to apply a high press on Stoke's midfield and back-line and win the ball back high up the pitch or in the middle. We moved the ball with more urgency and had better ball retention through the middle of the pitch, which let us frequently pin Stoke back into their 18-yard box. Henderson and Milner made clever supporting runs past Benteke and that almost paid off when Henderson was sent through. The introduction of Firmino was late but he showed the verticality in his game in his brief period and his hustle made it very difficult for Stoke to retain the ball. 

Milner Henderson and Can made a robust, energetic midfield trio, with Can usually the deepest of them, occasionally bursting forward with the ball: he almost sent Benteke through with a lovely sliding pass. The absence of a pure defensive midfield in this three was not concerning as they all have the dynamism and intelligence to cover effectively for each other. Perhaps with the 3 of them playing in a low block the lack of a 'pure DM' could be felt but I have a feeling that with the 3 of them on the pitch we will always attempt to press and play a very vertical game. I expect us to set up roughly as we finished this game in our next game home to Bournemouth. 

The Coutinho goal, aside from being a glorious piece of skill, was a product of us stretching the game and upping the tempo. Ultimately we want Coutinho to be in situations where he can turn a man and run at a back line, as that is by far when he is most dangerous. The Stoke back 4 have a really tough decision to make at that point, because if they engage him in possession they leave space in behind for Coutinho to slip Firmino or Benteke into a goalscoring position, and if they stay back to counter that threat he has it in his locker to do what he did. The goal is a remarkable piece of individual skill but the team and Rodgers deserve credit for creating a situation where Coutinho gets a 1 on 1 and then a run at the back 4.

**Approach**

If we take this game as an indication of how Rodgers plans to set up against strong mid-table teams away, I see how the strategy can be applied effectively in future games. For the majority of the match we clearly looked to soak up pressure and defend in numbers, and use possession cautiously as not to get caught on the break. Our defensive shape was excellent and our back four gave an assured defensive performance. The later stages of the match were when we chose to open the game up and push a tired Stoke, and our play on and off the ball in this half hour was extremely promising. Against our more direct rivals this strategy might be unwise, since allowing teams like Arsenal, Chelsea, City to build from the back is dangerous. Hopefully in those games we go for a high-tempo high-energy pressing game as I see that as our best way of nullifying a higher quality of opposition. I hope we can improve on our play in possession and going forward within this framework of how to approach away games against lower opposition and play with a real ruthless streak this season: playing pragmatically and solidly will get us very far against teams of lower quality.

**Miscellaneous Talking Points**

- Clyne had an excellent debut, very little got past him on his side of the pitch and he was never caught upfield or caught in possession. People will expect more from him going forward but I will be delighted if he can keep that right hand side on lockdown all season. Does the simple stuff well and he gave Affelay very little space to work with.

- Gomez had a tough debut, being matched up with Jonathan Walters who is always a pain in the hole. Aside from a few shaky moments in the first half he was assertive and grew as the game went on. Thought he dealt with Stoke's physical threat a lot more convincingly than Moreno would've although obviously he offers less going forward.

- Benteke had a solid debut, at the very least he will always keep the centre-backs occupied and make space for our other attackers. Not his fault he was isolated in the first half and he came into the game nicely in the last half-hour. Could have had a goal if Henderson had teed him up properly for *that* chance.

- Quite pleased with our newfound robustness. Stoke are still a big team despite their quest to become Stokelona and we never let them bully us and seemed to relish the physical battle. Nice to see a bit of aggression and power and it genuinely seems like we have strength and mobility all over the field now. Fantastic to see Milner taking a lump out of Adam, Clyne mincing Affelay and Lovren elbowing Diouf. Can't see us being a push-over for any of our rivals. 

- Lallana had a poor game on the ball but to his credit was disciplined in our midfield 4 off the ball. If he keeps killing the tempo in possession and making poor decisions on the ball he won't get many more chances in the starting line-up.

- Lovren, despite all the pressure came out and played a very solid game. Assured in possession and bullied Diouf out of possession. Played a few clever passes forward that started attacks. Skrtel by contrast gave me a few heart attacks with his underhit passes back to Mignolet. Would love to see one of Gomez or Ilori given a go at RCB in the cup competitions instead of Kolo.

- Ibe needs to improve his game now that the opposition are content to double up on him. He has the pace to make runs in behind and a nice finish on him so I would like to see him try and play behind the defence more often than in front of them. He has potential to be very effective on the counter if he improves his decision making too.

**Final points**

A promising start to the season, with many areas to improve but at the very least it seems like we may have a base of solidity to work off this season. For all Hughes said about us not deserving the win or it being down to a moment of magic we seemed in control for the whole game, even if we weren't necessarily creating a lot of chances. We do need to improve and improve quickly if we're going to get anything out of our next few away games though. For Bournemouth I expect us to start as we finished, with Moreno possibly coming in for Gomez to give us greater width down the left. Before the season we might have assumed that the midfield two would be for home games and we would stick to a three in away games, but it seems like the reverse is true, with the three signalling a front-foot vertical game and the two signalling an attempt to defend in banks of four and keep it tight.

I do not pretend to know about this Rahman guy, but I am only going off what people have said and his potential ranking at 7 was it in the Bundesliga. Now this doesnt mean much considering it is a new league but it would suggest he is quite good.



The problem for me is that when I watch Azpilicueta on the left is that he is not left footed, sure he has got better, but not good enough at crossing, which is losing a whole other attacking input. He always has to cut back and pass it off etc.


If we were to just have 2 natural fullbacks we would be so much more of a threat. Ok we lose something with Ivanovic's attacking play, but maybe with Willian not having to bust a gut as much due to Azpilicueta's presence, he could excel even more. Also having Azpilicueta on the left in my opinion makes it harder for teams to mark out Hazard. If they had another attacking threat to deal with on the left it would undoubtedly free up more space for Hazard to add even more to our/his game which would make us even stronger. 



Mourinho said when FL was brought in he could put Ivanovic at CB and Azpilicueta @ RB, but it never materialised. Maybe it was because Ivanovic's form prevented this, and rightly so, if you perform well you should keep your place, only JM knows if he ever intended to fully integrate FL into the main starting XI or not. 


We really need to have correct fullbacks in their correct positions this season. It worked for the last 2 years but I really feel it is catching up with us now and considering our attack hasnt changed, the attacking input from our defence needs to, to reshuffle to help out the attacking players. 




And as for Stones, do you think come the end of the season it will be him and Terry, Stones coming in for Terry in certain games? What about Zouma, what about Ivanovic playing as a CB because Azpilicueta is on the right? 




I do not know if the club is willing to justify spending £50m/£55m+ on 2 defenders who may not even get into our starting XI.



Do you believe that when Rahman is confirmed he will become a starter this season? Same goes for Stones if Chelsea put in a bid worthy of being accepted by Everton?

I can't be very picky because I want to start the searches as soon as possible (I am leaving for a couple of weeks this week and don't want the flat to go back on the market). As expected, the agency that is selling the property is pushing me into going with their solicitors.

The total quote for £260K flat in London is £1700-ish (VAT included, Stamp Duty is not). I guess the only possible variable in the breakdown is solicitor's fee which is £960 (VAT included) which I am afraid is a bit too high. However, it looks like everyone I know who bought the property recently was paying roughly in that range.

The problem is that any online calculator I try gives me under £1000 total figure (not just the fee)! I strongly suspect this is underestimation is a marketing trick, but as I said I don't have time to make dozens of phone calls to figure out.

While I don't mind paying somewhat more given my circumstances, parting with extra several hundred would be ridiculous. Can you by any chance tell me if this price looks normal these days? Thank you.

Mbemba looked strong and pacy and competent at the back, Mitrovic was a bit ridiculous but packs huge potential, and Wijnaldum looked fantastic. The goal he scored aside, every time he was on the ball I felt a little anxious. He seems to have the quality to take a man on and that is the kind of player you can never have enough of. And I started to realize that these were all targets we could have gotten, then looking at the business we have done in this window I wonder if the management have out smarted themselves.

It was inevitable that players (Morgan Schneiderlin) would leave but the deal for Clyne seemed a bit odd. Why didn't they sell him to United who ended up paying more for Darmian? Then he would have actually gotten Champions League football as I am assuming that is what he wanted. Am I missing something? It just feels like we could have gotten more out of him. 

Now let's go through the teams that finished below us and got players we should have been in for.

Swansea: Ayew, how were we not looking to pick this guy up on a free? We let two wingers/secondary strikers leave this window by not securing them on permanent transfers. And with Europa League Ayew would have definitely gotten a good amount of games. Plus he is another one of those players who can take a man on not to mention is a good finisher as well.
Stoke: I will leave them out because their transfer business has been very unique to say the least and it seems that we are not in the business of picking up Barca castoffs but I did think that Affelay looked exciting at moments against Liverpool and I wouldn't have minded him. I imagine Koeman would have been partial to a fellow compatriot who played at Barca as well.
West Ham: Payet looks amazing and I think Obiang may be a better Schneiderlin replacement than Clasie is, in terms of a physical presence in the midfield.
Newcastle: The aforementioned Wijnaldum.

I know we havn't seen much of most of these players but it just feels like the management is getting a little too cute with finding diamonds in the rough. Sometimes if you are giving up some diamonds its nice to bring in something that has a more immediate chance of replacing it.

Let's see what they did:

Clyne: Cedric/Martina- Both of these seem like purely attacking fullbacks, Clyne would bomb up a good bit but was also solid at the back. Unless Koeman is planning on coaching the hell out of these guys and expecting real drastic in season improvement I can't see this turning out that well.

Alderweireld: Caulker- Obviously there were some shady things that went on with this transfer it seems and I like Caulker a good bit as a physical talent but I would like another Center Back just for the Europa League.

Schneiderlin: Clasie?- Is this really the replacement for Schneiderlin? Clasie is a good player don't get me wrong but we needed another tackler to replace what Morgan brought to the team. I would expect that Koeman will change up his tactics to allow Clasie to better fit in and Wanyama is a boss so it could work but if Clasie is the premier player brought in this window I would kind of see it as a let down.

Djuricic/Elia: JRod- I am guessing that with Jay returning to fitness these players were seen as expendable or at least not worth the prices that were being asked. But again with European football being played midweek I would like at least one more attacking threat.

What else needs to be done?
I hope we can bring in one more CB, if Caulker is going to start in the EPL then it doesn't have to be one of Van Djik's quality but at least someone who can play in some midweek games and has some potential.
I would also like one more attacking threat. I feel like we need two though. It is ridiculous to expect Pelle to be able to start up front every game of the year. And Mane is our only player who seems to be able to take players on with any regularity. I know that Juanmi could be one of those guys but it feels like we need more than just Shane Long's pace to be able to bring off the bench, or rotate the squad with.

I know that Mane was a late signing last season and I really am hoping for another one of those. I was super excited by the Goretzka links even though he doesn't fit any of the needs I outlined he would be an excellent Schneiderlin replacement I think.

Initially, the landlord informed us that we would be taking £100 each off of us for damages that we felt would rest within wear and tear i.e. washing machine parts needed replacing (even charging us for the downpipe which was broken when we were burgled!).

We asked him for an itemised list of costs he has had to pay and he refused, everytime the subject has been brought up with him he cites a different reason for the costs. He then announced that he would be charging us for late fees on rent after an argument with one especially drunk tenant. He has only announced these late fees (which are in the tenancy agreement) 6 weeks after our tenancy expired. He had never mentioned that he would be seeking late fees at the time, seemingly happy to take the rent as and when it came (normally around student loan time).

As it stands the landlord is point blank refusing to cooperate and insisting we take him to court if we want any of our deposit back.

Oh, it's worth mentioning that he claims the lead tenant signed a deposit protection certificate but the web service he claims to have used doesn't return any results for him otherwise we would have started arbitration with them.

I would like to know if the following figures seem accurate for a contractor / freelancer operating as a one man ltd. company.

Day rate: £500

Assume no downtime between contracts, as the market is quite strong and has been for a long time.

I will be operating outside of IR35, as I expect to be working for a new client every 6 to 9 months.

Minimal expenses, a business phone, a laptop, £700pm rail ticket is that can be claimed.

I've run the numbers through the various calculators out there and there's quite a bit of variance:

Back then, I thought the article was very good in what it said and surpasses the usual media quality - I think some platforms covering D/A/CH football are really extraordinary.  
  
Articles:  
[Number 1](http://www.watson.ch/Sport/Spielverlagerung/649409618-Guardiola-ist-zu-Recht-sauer--F%C3%BCnf-Dinge--die-Xherdan-Shaqiri-bei-Bayern-taktisch-falsch-macht)  
[Number 2](http://www.watson.ch/Sport/articles/636734859-Guardiola-l%C3%A4sst-Shaqiri-im-Winter-gehen-%E2%80%93-weil-dieser-seine-Taktik-nicht-versteht)  
  
The articles were written when Bayern decided to let Shaqiri go and Inter Milan were the potential taker.  
  
**Key Outtakes:**  
  
- According to [Bild](http://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/bayern-muenchen/kann-im-winter-gehen-38608198.bild.html) who are usually very well-informed when it comes to German football, Guardiola was fed up with Shaqiri because he lacked in-game-intelligence and that he could not meet the high tactical requirements by the Catalan star trainer. Apparently he had not developed in the two years he was in Munich at all.  
  
- **His movement in his positioning.** Guardiola's philosophy is very dynamic and clever positioning is mandatory to make it work. According to the position of the ball, players take over certain positions. At the same time, the system can be adapted by players moving that have very complex follow-ups for the room distribution of other players. For instance, not more than three players are allowed to be on a horizontal like while at the same time there are only two players max allowed on a vertical line. It's pretty complicated. Shaqiri did not quite get that concept and brought a bit of chaos for his teammates when positioning.  
  
- **His decision making in his passing game.** Based on the previous point, passing changes the position of the ball and plays a very important strategic part - because players need to adapt to the new position of the ball on the fly. Constant moving and positioning is required. When changing sides with the ball, Bayern pressures the opposition to shift as well which results in gains in room. Shaqiri sometimes lacked the correct timing so that resulted in situations where he should have switched sides but chose the closer pass which put the receiver of the pass in a problematic situation while in situation where he should have passed, he simply didn't which slowed the game down or resulted in another pass without gaining territorial advantage or a dribbling - which is quite problematic in the last third of the pitch.  
  
- **His behavior in the last third of the pitch.** The ball circulation isn't very problematic in the first third of the pitch and in midfield as long as you don't lose the ball. But on the other side, if you mis-judge the distribution in the last third of the pitch, that can lead to very problematic counter attacks, especially because Bayerns defence was standing quite high.  
  
- **His running lines within the combination game.** Shaqiri had a problem in judgment when it comes to running lines of his teammates as well as his own. He constanly failed to see openings where he could have liberated himself from a defender or influenced the movement flow of enemy defences. Oftentimes he did not look for sprints up front - so he wasn't a passing option in front of goal and his team mates could not make a pass that gains a bit of space. And sometimes he started to run in very inappropriate moments whilst also being deep in the pocket of his marker so that he was effectively no real passing option. The most problematic thing was his high ball-fixation in tight situations. He was too close to his teammates which made him a proper passing option but the reduced distance between him and his teammates made it easy for oppositions to deal with it easily. When keeping the importance of Guardiolas emphasis on structured passing in mind, this might have been the number 1 reason why Shaqiri was out of favor at Bayern.  
  
- **His judgment of the in-game dynamics.** Shaqiris main problem is his calculation of opponents' movements and how they affect his own actions and these of his teammates. Although Shaqiri has all the marks of a great footballer, robustness, speed, great coordination, strong technique, being both-footed and good shooting, he cannot play up to his potential on a regular basis. When he is confronted with extremely fast, close and complex situations, he makes mistakes.  
  
- **Conclusion:** Shaqiri has numerous flaws, which isn't a problem because he has quite a number of real strenghts. His problem was, however, that his strengths weren't really visible in Guardiola's system as did his weaknesses. Pair this with not developing in 2 years and the extremely high competition at Bayern and it was obvious that he had to go.  
  
So. There were reasons he did not really excel at Bayern. He played 20 games for Inter (747') and scored three times while having 2 assists. Not so stellar stats but acceptable for his position. The fact that Inter definitely want him out gives us room to think, though. This is the second club that wants to offload him rather urgently.  
  
I think that with him, a club definitely needs a plan to play to his strengths while minimizing his shortcomings. I am not sure that Everton would be the right club for him because the one thing that we would need is consitency and not genius (it works both ways!). We have quite a few younger players who can go for the unexpected and also Geri is someone who will bring a bit of dis-order with him... making our front-line completely hit or miss is probably the wrong way to do it.

I guess that's just Spurs in general. Regardless, we showed signs of improvement in terms of building from the back but it's painfully apparent that we still need a solid midfielder and a firecracker up front. 

In regards to midfield, we definitely need a destroyer of a DM. We've been trying to replace kung-fu Sandro for so long that I forget what it's like to have a protector back there. Bentaleb looks like a promising play maker, but doesn't seem like he really has the defensive grit. He was also piss poor in the Audi Cup and at OT, so hopefully he gets his shit together so we're not completely fucked in the middle of the park. Bender seems to be the guy in the ITK but I can't see us putting in too high of a bid for someone who hasn't really been featuring regularly since 2011-2012. 

This is where I think we should continue our method of restructuring internally. I love the fact that our squad is so young and impressionable. I like that younger players (if they are well disciplined) are willing to listen to the manager and try out different things. We've been seeing this with Dier and his willingness to play RB and CDM. I think the next player that Poch should try molding is Erik Lamela, and I think he should try playing him at CDM. 

I know, this is crazy. We spent nearly 30m on the kid and that was because we expected goals and assists. That hasn't really come to fruition other than a few nice goals with his left and a beautiful rabona. Erik's best attributes for us have been his pressing, his grittiness to win the ball back and his occasional needle threading through ball. We saw in the Audi Cup how he wasn't afraid to go shoulder to shoulder with players like Ramos and I remember last season away at Villa he had no problem bodying up against Benteke in the scuffle that ended up with Benteke getting red carded due to some nice riling up from Mason. The kid has some grit and he's shown that he has the determination to get stronger physically. 

It's obvious that Lamela is not going to be our Hazard or Sanchez or Depay. His sprint speed is decent but I don't think a single team really fears him when he's running at their defense. He's got a good shot on him but he's almost is never in a decent shooting position. There have also been times where I've seen him try to connect to a ball coming into the box and just slips and make it looks like a slide tackle. 

I think that his ability to play these beautiful through balls (think of his assists for Chadli against the scum, assist for Kane against Forest, even his recent assist for Tom Carroll against Milan) could be super effective in a deeper role. We need someone to come in and control the game from the back like Modric did and start the forward progression earlier.

**Quick bit of Subreddit news, I'm now a moderator of /r/SaintsFC after /u/Saintless as stepped down. He originally created this subreddit and has seen it grow from just a small handful of people to over 1600 subscribers. I'll do my best over the coming months to provide more fresh content as well as update the image of the subreddit. I've started that today with adding the crests of the new PL teams, the Europa League logo as well as completely fresh and updated player images and numbers for the sidebar. You'll also see the sidebar updated a lot more frequently so remember to check back! Flair is next on the list, this won't come super soon but give it a couple weeks and hopefully you can choose yourself a lovely flair to show off. I'd appreciate putting all flair suggestions and ideas in the comments here.** 

**Me and /u/miomike are also going to work on a new content policy to avoid the subreddit becoming too clogged up with similar posts, look out for that in the coming weeks. Cheers!**

**Newcastle Utd 2 - 2 Southampton FC**

Well, where to begin here? Not the finest display I've ever seen, in fact one of the worst performances I've seen from us in quite a long time. The first half was appallingly bad apart from an absolutely excellent Pelle header. Sharpened up towards the end of the match but there was some seriously lackluster defending, even Fonte looked shaken at times. Targett gets 10/10 for effort but as much as I love him, he definitely struggled a fair bit. Great to see JRod back on the pitch but maybe it was too soon for him to be starting matches as he looked a bit lost and struggled to have the strength required going forward. I would've been happy with a draw before the match and especially at half time but Mane really should've finished for all three points, if he can improve his finishing then we're onto a real winner there. Cedric and Martina had a bit of a physical introduction to the PL but I reckon they'll both have good seasons. Just need to get Van Dijk on the plane...

So not as bad as it could have been, we're 1 point up on last season already! Pelle scored again to keep up his 100% record this season; away from home too which is pretty rare.

**Vitesse 0 - 2 Southampton**

Horrah! Our first away goal in Europe since 1981, guess who it was too? Pelle is on absolute form at the moment, fingers crossed he can keep it up better than last season. Quite a dull game in many ways, looked an awful lot like a pre-season friendly. Sitting back, defending, not putting too much effort into chasing down balls or making hard tackles. Scoring so early on was vitally important, forcing Vitesse to score five took the wind out of their sails and effectively ended the tie. On paper, they were the hardest team we could've drawn in the third round so to keep a clean sheet and get five in the net is absolutely fantastic. Onwards and upwards!

**Play Off Round**

Into the fourth round we go! We've drawn FC Midtjylland from Denmark. Definitely one of the better teams we could've drawn. There were a couple harder teams and also a couple easier teams but at least we don't have to travel to Romania or Azerbaijan. I'll try and do a little profile of them at the beginning of next week but they're not a team to be underestimated. Dropping down from the CL after losing to Cypriot team APOEL, they won the Danish League last year. They do have a lower coefficient than Vitesse but I think the matches will be a little harder. They're the last barrier between us and the group stages!

Elsewhere in the Premier League

[Man Utd 1-0 Tottenham:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744640) Good news here I think! We're definitely not going to be challenging for position with Utd but we will do with Spurs hopefully so that's an ideal result. 

[Bournemouth 0-1 Aston Villa:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744565) Such a shame the Cherries couldn't get anything there, had some great opportunities to score but sadly couldn't hold Villa off. Shouldn't affect us. 

[Everton 2-2 Watford:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744642) Fantastic game from Watford, thoroughly deserved at least a point, possibly all three. Everton look quite ragged around the edges so hopefully after a week off we'll be able to get yet another home win against them. 

[Leicester 4-2 Sunderland:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744669) Oh dear, oh dear! Sunderland having yet another implosion, Leicester looked extremely good at times but I think that was more to do with Sunderland being beyond terrible. Shouldn't affect us in anyway. 

[Norwich 1-3 Crystal Palace:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744606) Disappointing result, Crystal Palace are going to be strong this year and it could so easily have been a draw had Norwich not been so unlucky with referee decisions.

[Chelsea 2-2 Swansea:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744668) Poor result. Swansea are going to be right up this season and getting something away at Chelsea is very good for them, our match in September will not be easy. 

[Arsenal 0-2 West Ham:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33750502) Maybe they're pleased they ballsed up Europa now they've got this result? I still know where I'd rather be. Not good news for us though, again another team we'll be battling with most likely. 

[Stoke 0-1 Liverpool:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33750574) Both sides looked pretty average excluding one wonderstrike. One could argue it's a good result for us though. 

[West Brom - Manchester City:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33754829) Tonight's match, a City win would probably be better for us but it shouldn't affect us either way. Lambert for a hat-trick?

Loan Update
---
---
[Jack Stephens at Middlesbrough](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33750467) Stephens was an unused substitute for Boro on Sunday as they played out a 0-0 draw away at Preston. They're playing away at Oldham on Wednesday in the first round of the League Cup so I think his Boro debut will come there. 

[Jordan Turnbull at Swindon Town](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744332) Swindon started the season off well with a 4-1 at home to Bradford in League One despite going 1-0 down early on. Turnbull played the full 90 minutes and even set up the fourth goal with quite an attractive pass. 

[Sam Gallagher at MK 'Dons'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33744183) MK 'Dons' go top of the Championship table on the first day after a convincing 4-1 trouncing away at Rotherham United. Gallagher played the first 75 minutes and had quite an impressive game from what I've heard. He set up two goals and almost scored on a couple of occasions himself, could be a very frequent starter for what is a very strong championship side. 

Injury update
---
---

**Forster**: Still our for what could be the entire season, no news to say otherwise yet.

**Gardos**: Knee problem has put him our for several months hence the Caulker signing. 

**Ramirez**: Completely anonymous in terms of club news, seems generally unfit. 

**Clasie**: Could be back for the Everton match but not too likely, could take another week with the hamstring injury. 

**Bertrand**: Out until at least the 23rd after a knee operation.

**Southampton FC's Under-18**'s squad continued in typical form with a 2-1 loss away at Aston Villa.

**Bournemouth:** Sadly couldn't get anything at home to Villa but had their first PL match with a cracking atmosphere, I'm sure we're all behind them to stay up!

**Eastleigh:** Can't really ask for a better start to the season than this, 4-0 win away at Southport meant that they ended the night in first place in the National League. 

**Portsmouth:** 3-0 at home to Dagenham and Redbridge. A mighty result against incredibly tough opposition. Completely odds on to get promotion, anything else will be a disaster considering what they've spent. Got a tough League Cup match at home to Derby this week which will be televised on Sky. If they lose, it's always pleasurable to see a pompey loss and if they win then it's a slight increase in terms of chances to play them this season. Win-win!

I was thinking about this yesterday when watching the match, where I thought Benteke played well in parts; link up play looked good, short passing was very crisp, thought we went long to him a little too often though (Hendo and Lallana most guilty of this).

It did make me wonder how much people expect Ings and Origi to play this year? I understand Benteke is a good fit against a team like Stoke, where at times you can really do with an outlet and physical presence; but I did wonder if Rodgers would actually rotate him with our other two options for different games. Obviously Sturridge is due to come back as well.

Any teams in particular you'd like either of those two to get games against?

Basically, I was on housing benefits for a while and my backdated benefit ended up overpaying for my rent (to the tune of about £400). I should make clear that the housing benefit was not overpaid, it was just paid to the wrong people (as I had borrowed money from friends to pay rent before this), and should have gone into my account. They also still have my deposit (£300) about 2 months after moving out. 

One of my old housemates is £550 behind in rent and my landlords are refusing to pay me until he pays them. We signed a joint contract (stupid students!) and I understand that legally they can just hold onto my deposit, but the other £400 would go a long way towards getting myself (non student) debt free again.

Is there any action I can take to get this from them?

He's done it against us successfully a few times and he attempted it during the game yesterday.

Milner seems to have a knack or a good ability to run down the wing (maybe not so far out, along the line of the 18 yard box) until he gets nearly to the touch line at the opponents end and then he will cross the ball with pace, diagonally into the middle of the box.

Benteke was almost at the end of it yesterday but I think in a few weeks once everyone is used to it then it should certainly be a move that should get us at least one goal this season and hopefully lots of good opportunities.

I haven't been able to find a good highlight of it but it's pretty close to the pass in the play here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knl0r4jhghc&amp;t=1m55s In that video he does it from the left side but he often does it from the right side as well.

Also I had no idea where to put Morrison will probably play instead of Gnabry (match fitness) and hopefully Gamboa will play! Rondon deal will probably be confirmed at some moment.

So what are your thoughts?

She was airlifted to hospital where she had several broken bones and her spleen was removed. She has since recovered as best as could be expected from this awful injury.

My dad was uninsured, not through malice but because he made an error when signing up for his insurance over the phone and did not declare that he had previously been banned from driving for 6 months for accumulating too many points from speeding. He paid his premiums consistently and believed he was insured.

He has fully cooperated with all police investigations and feels awful for the injury he has inflicted upon the injured woman.

He has also been diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a degenerative, incurable lung disease and is not expected to live more than a couple of years. He is now on oxygen and cannot walk further than 20 yards at a time. He's always exhausted and rarely leaves his bed.

His criminal court case for dangerous driving is in a couple of weeks time. After that the victim is expected to sue him for damages.All that he owns is his business which is struggling. He has no further assets, breaking it apart would put 35 employees out of a job.

What is going to happen to him? Can the lawyers take his business?

EDIT:
Thank you for responding. To answer the questions, Yes he does have a solicitor for the criminal case in a couple of weeks time. He is being charged with dangerous driving, which if that does not stick could be dropped to careless driving which he will likely be convicted of. I don't think he could be incarcerated either way due to his health. 

His business is in trouble because about a year and a half ago when he was first diagnosed with this disease and it affected his daily life he hired an experienced MD to take over and run the business. In that time the MD had made a series of terrible decisions, almost taken the business under and has recently resigned. This has left no-one in charge with my dad unable to take the reigns. My sister is currently taking care of day to day affairs but she has no interest in managing a business and is a yoga instructor and loves doing that. 

I am currently considering giving up my career to take on the responsibility, which is why the question what can happen to my father's assets is relevant. 

If he is found guilty in the criminal court and is then sued by the victim of his accident, what could happen to his business (as his sole asset)?

I understand that he is a separate legal entity from the company and therefore it is not liable for his mistakes, however the companies shares belong to him as an asset? Can his assets be taken? 

2nd EDIT:
The insurance company has claimed that his insurance is null and void since he faild to disclose the previous conviction. Thank you for the suggestion to go through the Ombudsman, his lawyers have not mentioned that once.

At 5’10,” the Ghanaian born international is often classified as a shutdown defender, however, his four assists (topping Augsburg’s assist chart and tied for third in the Bundesliga at the time of writing) showcase yet another highly desirable facet of an ever-expanding skill set.

I would welcome a second opinion.

**Situation**:

* two years ago I took out a phone contract (£42 a month)
* one year ago I lost my job. Called EE and they were nice enough to reduce my tariff by £5 a month. Surprised but extremely grateful.
* sorting out benefits, job hunting, final work on PhD etc for next months - forgot all about it
* today - called to cancel my contract as it's up - discovered this reduction hadn't been applied.

*(yeah, I know I fail for not noticing before now)*

* talked to three people who said there was no record of the discussion I'd had with the earlier agent last year - though there was I record I'd made a call to them. Nothing in the diary
* his argument was also that it's 'company policy' to extend the contract by 6 months if you reduce the tariff. This was not mentioned to me and I never would have agreed that because I'm not stupid, if they'd mentioned that I'd have done the math and realised I'd be worse off financially.
* so, short of refunding me the difference but extending my contract another 6 months there was nothing they could do
* that would be ridiculous since I barely use my phone now - I'm not even coming close to the data limits

**So?**

* off I went with the details to write a letter or complaint
* last dude I talked to calls back. Says he's talked to his manager and they'd found the note to make a £5 reduction in tariff - though this hadn't been applied
* he was willing to offer me £60 - the refund for the 12 months I've overpaid - which was going above and beyond because really they should be extending my contract along with it and they're not going to do that.
* the key phrase he used (which sparked my red flags) was this refund was on condition that this was a **full and final settlement** which sounds a bit off to me somewhere.

**My questions, to people more knowledgeable that I**:

* reckon I should just take this and be done with it?
* am I shooting myself in the foot by not taking it - there's no record of the call now and it's just my word against this guy and 'company policy'
* I'm not sure what else I would want really - but an apology would be nice and say - maybe acouple of months of credit for my new pay as you go phone *which I just took out with them* - that would be perfect. This would come to £10 a month, so like what £20 or something?

This concerns my aunt not me. Basically I think my aunt has been the victim of a insurance scam that involved another driver purposefully causing her crash into the back of his car in order for him and his 3 passengers to make fraudulent personal injury claims.

My aunt was going shopping and had not long set from a set of traffic lights, so wasn't going fast at all, when the car in front slammed its brakes causing her to hit the back of his car (she was totally uninjured thankfully). The damage was minimal to the back of his car but very significant to hers (the car will probably be written off). After the incident when my aunt asked him why he braked he just said ""I don't know"". As it happens a another motorist saw the crash and stopped to tell her he felt the other driver caused the accident on purpose and insisted on calling the police.

The witness left before the police arrived but he left his contact information. The police obviously carried out their normal procedures of taking statements, breathalyzing (she was clear) and such but said even though they felt the other driver was at fault it is up to the insurance company to decide whether to pay out. As this happens quite often the police said the insurance will likely just pay up rather than investigate. My aunt hasn't yet contacted her insurance although they did exchange information.
I was just looking for advice about how she can avoid taking the blame and possibly get the the driver and passengers arrested for fraud and maybe dangerous driving? Her financial situation is already tight and the last thing she needs is higher insurance premiums especially now her car, which she needs to get to work, is probably totaled.

TL;DR: Driver purposefully caused Aunt to crash into them in order to claim 'whiplash'.",false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,null,null,self,Possible case of insurance fraud [England],1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/3ghgdf/possible_case_of_insurance_fraud_england/

Going to keep this short:

Landlord wants us out by 1st September, he has sold the property to an investor, we're technically lodgers so we haven't got much of a leg to stand on. We've had just one months notice, finding somewhere is proving to be impossible. I'm on the verge of being sick.

We're ideal tenants, the time we have to find somewhere between work and my partner being away for a week is just mind-blowingly stressful right now. I'm on all the property websites, mailing lists, gumtree, classifieds and so on.

Beggars can't be choosers, but Carrington, Sherwood, Beeston, Sneinton are where we wish to be. Closer to Beeston the better as we both work there and dropping our bus passes would save us some cash.

Oh, and to add icing to the cake, I care for my daughter every other weekend, so house shares aren't really an option for us.

A small group of Swansea City AFC supporters in Portland, Oregon gathered at a local pub on Saturday morning to watch the match versus Chelsea. This was a our first meeting and it inspired me to form a Facebook group where we can coordinate viewing parties and maybe someday plan a trip across the pond to Liberty. 


I only started following Swansea last season but my choice was coincidentally and fortuitously validated by the US debut of ""Jack to a King: The Swansea Story,"" organized in part by expatriate Swansea City fan Jonathan Weaver and the Timbers Army, the supporters group of my local club, Portland Timbers. More encouraging was the generosity of Mal Pope, Lee Trundle, and Leigh Dineen, who participated in an internet video call Q&amp;A between the Swansea City boardroom and Portland, Oregon after the premier screening. Sending Swansea City kits to all 500 ticket-buyers was pretty classy as well. There was also a raffle of some Swansea City AFC collectable memorabilia. The proceeds went to support remodeling Cinema 21, the arthouse theater that hosted the screening, and refurbishing the football/soccer pitch at a local school. 


I hope to use this Facebook group to help build more connections between Portland and Swansea, and Swansea fans everywhere. It would be amazing if Portland Timbers were able to host Swansea City in a friendly during Premier League offseason. We've hosted AIK, Boca Juniors, Ajax, Club America, Portmore United, Aston Villa, Valencia, Morelia, Norwich City, Independiente, West Brom, Newcastle, Sunderland, and others in the past. Swansea City would be an ideal prospect for the future.

&gt; To ensure we have secure, affordable, clean energy supplies for our families and businesses, we will need a diverse energy mix, including significant quantities of renewables, nuclear and gas.

&gt; The Government is committed to a low carbon and affordable future for energy while also ensuring bill payers are getting the best possible deal.

&gt; The Government supports renewable energy technologies and is working towards a transition to a low carbon economy. The UK has some of the best wind, wave and tidal resources in Europe. Renewable energy offers an attractive market for investors, one that already supports skills and jobs through the supply chain.

&gt; We are currently implementing a renewable energy deployment programme to ensure we generate at least 30% of our electricity from renewables by 2020. At the end of 2013, our share of electricity generation from renewable energy was 14.9%. In 2014 this figure rose to 19.2%, and a record of 22.3% was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. Since 2010 we have seen an average of £7 billion a year of investment in renewables and last year we reached a record high of almost £8 billion.

&gt; Around a third of UK energy demand is met by gas, the cleanest fossil fuel. A quarter of that is used to produce electricity, some is a vital ingredient for industry and nearly all the rest is used to heat our buildings and cook our food. So it’s vital that we seize the opportunity to explore the UK’s shale gas potential whilst maintaining the very highest safety and environmental standards, which we have established as world leaders in extracting oil and gas over the past 50 years. The Government is committed to developing this new source of energy as part of our work to ensure our energy security. Developing shale gas could create a whole new British industry, provide more jobs and make us less reliant on volatile imports from abroad.

&gt; Reports by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, as well as Public Health England considered a wide range of evidence on hydraulic fracturing in the UK context. They concluded that risks can be well managed if the industry follows best practice, enforced through regulation. The UK has over 50 years’ experience regulating the onshore oil and gas industry, and measures are in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent environmental contamination, mitigate seismic activity and minimise emissions. A company looking to develop shale will still need to obtain all the necessary permissions, like planning and environmental permits. Our system is robust and we are proven world leaders in well regulated, safe and environmentally sound oil and gas developments.

&gt; To reinforce these regulations, the Infrastructure Act 2015 brought forward a range of further requirements if an operator is to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward in a balanced way. These include environmental impact assessments, groundwater monitoring, community payments and the exclusion of hydraulic fracturing in protected areas.

&gt; It is important that local communities who are hosting wells are able to share in the benefits of development. The industry has committed to provide £100,000 in community payments per fractured well and 1% of any subsequent production revenues. Companies may well offer payments over and above these amounts.

&gt; UK shale development is compatible with our goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and does not detract from our support for renewables. As the UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said in 2013, the UK will “continue to use considerable, albeit declining, amounts of gas well into the 2030s” and “if anything, using well-regulated UK shale gas… could lead to lower overall greenhouse gas emissions than continuing to import gas”. The CCC is an independent, statutory body, whose purpose is to advise the UK Government and Devolved Administrations on emissions targets and report to Parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. Shale gas can create a bridge while we develop renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and build new nuclear. To make absolutely sure, we have included in the Infrastructure Act a requirement to seek advice from the CCC on the implications of shale gas for our legally binding carbon targets.

&gt; This is not a renewables versus gas issue – to meet our challenging climate targets we will need significant quantities of renewables, nuclear and gas in our energy mix.

Of course it's frustrating sometimes but I've always felt I've supported the team and players.

I think it really annoys me when people jump to ridiculously early conclusions and try to bring a dark cloud even over positive times. The ""meltdown"" last summer was probably the most frustrating summer for me for this reason. I was one of the people who didn't think the board were lying and the club was in meltdown and although it was pretty satisfying to see the club come out stronger, I won't forget some of the stupid things people said both in person at our pre-season friendlies and online.

Seeing the same sort of things being said after a good performance at Newcastle is just madness and now some people are doubting new signings after less than 90 minutes on a Premier League pitch. It's madness.

I can't help noticing that some of the more negative people seem like more recent additions to the Saints fan base (on Reddit anyway) so I wonder if this is due to heightened expectations in the recent years? or a different mindset bought in from other sporting cultures?

But here is the thing - from previous experience we have seen that some of you have not enjoyed the live thread as much and it mostly came down to not having the right info where needed.

The Live Thread has changed a lot since and for the better. As an example I am linking to [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/3gcb47/game_thread_chemnitzer_fc_dfb_pokal_rd_1/) on /r/borussiadortmund. This is what we want to achieve.

- A live score update right at the top

- Starting 11 and stream link under it

- Post regular updates every 10 min and highlight things like: cards, subs etc

- Link to a comment in the post itself that has these updates for a glance

- Link to the /r/soccer thread that corresponds to the fixture for those that want the normal style updates

We want to focus on the live thread mainly because 2-3 people can contribute to it and it doesn't build up the pressure on just one person to regularly update. We want a clean match thread because most of the information like venue, KO times etc are already available in detail in the pre-match.

Also another point, as i quote /u/djimonia:

&gt; i'm a fan of the guardian's MBMs and want to recreate that sense of conversation on this sub

It will definitely help the comment section too. We can post tweets, stats, maybe a couple of images here and there to make it more interesting.

If you guys have any other ideas please feel free to pitch in. We want to make this enjoyable for everyone.

Nothing special just a one bed, £120k price, with unallocated but controlled parking, in a block of flats.

Positives would obviously be the redevelopment of plenty of the area, the locality to the Arena for big/small events, the general pedestrian/cycling routes around Temple Meads apparently getting work done too. I believe there is also a linked development with restaurants etc in the area as well?

Negatives i imagine, depending on this car parking issue, possible traffic/parking issues. Flats have parking, but a road next to which is free 5pm-9am which isnt too busy at the moment for friends/family etc but likely will change. Though their is discussion on more parking for the Arena, and this metro bus system in place.

Other than general price changes, should i expect in 2 years or so when i expect to move on in general anyway any measurable value impact from it being near the new Arena?

Now when I got the ""quote"" for the filling I saw that it was £95, and that they said the Root Canal Treatment would cost £245.

However, after looking on the NHS website (www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/dentists/Pages/nhs-dental-charges.aspx) I believe that root canal work shouldn't cost more than £51.30 - and that the amalgam fillings cost a lot less than £95 also.

So my question (ideally to any dentists here or others who are more knowledgable than me in this) - Is my dentist trying to trick me into overpaying for something I can get for cheaper, or am I totally misunderstanding things?

Hi! My name is Knight and I was born in the USA.

Simple enough, except I had an almost exclusively British upbringing. My father was born in England, as was my aunt, grandmother, etc. That entire half of my family is British, and quite pleasant to be around.

My mother was born in America, and I've not been with this half of my family as much as I have my father's, in fact I just met my mother last year. 

I was born in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. Due to my British upbringing I've always thought of myself as 'being British' but that can't be right. Every time I tell people I'm British, there's an onslaught of questions. Some of which are ""Were you born there?"" and when I give my honest answer I'm immediately told I'm American. 

My question is, what makes you one nationality or another?? Does being born here just instantly label me with an American flag or is it the upbringing that makes you that nationality?? 

Also since I live overseas, does anyone know how I would go about applying for dual citizenship? ",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Am I American or British??,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/3gi50z/am_i_american_or_british/

first post on this sub, im Bi66sy.
Been playing for around 300 hours (60ish online matches.) look for either new players like myself or friendly any players to join up with a learn/play with. I current play support would say im confident with Lion,CM,dazzle and witch doctor with the right back up and have just started playing with Rubick (only bots at the moment)
Im online most nights and weekends UK time ofcourse (all though im head off now, that work thing early tomorrow)
only requirement is that you are friendly and understanding not only to team mates but opponents also.
With practise and if all works out in the distant future we could also turn in a to a team but that's a long long way off for me.

There are, however, some important points of note throughout these links.

It's one of the first steps before a full planning application is submitted. It's interesting because it describes the proposed new stadium (no images yet - they'll be in the full application).**

For starters, westfield is a maze, very nearly missed the appointment. It wouldn't have mattered anyway we were kept waiting 15 minutes. There's a small sofa area with season highlights on the TV, which is really good for the first half, then I had to turn my back on it. We are called over with the other people waiting. Sat down on some replica Olympic Stadium seats, they have padding on them, very comfy. Unfortunately these seats are out of my budget and it's a bit of a tease, these seats are within the 1966 area of seats. £1200. 
We are then lectured on why we need to move and how it will take us from being 12th in the league to 8th, honestly. We are encouraged to buy seats for our family and friends by selecting the seats next to us as child tickets £99 and upgrade them on a game by game basis. Working in retail banking this took me back to my days of mis-selling ppi. Anyway, this way you get the seat, empty all season, but for someone who goes ""maybe 4-5 times a year"", yep a quote, they can sit with you. This is the only opportunity you will have to do this as the seat might be sold by the next renewal date. 
Now as the video is about to go on we are told we are lucky enough to play a game where we have to spot the celebrities in the video and if we can spot them all we get a badge, yay. Due to my competitive nature I can't tell you much about the video other than where Ray Winston is. 
So we split up and are introduced to our sales assistant. This guy is friendly and knows all the answers to be fair. My real disappointment is the seats. So we are band 2 at present and we are told its only 40 pound to upgrade to 1 from what we CURRENTLY pay. So think carefully about that. It will cost £900 for band one.  The selection of band 2 that is left is awful. The problem is my like for like view is now a 1966 seat, which is out of budget. Maybe I was asking for too much but what I wanted was, no sun in my eyes, in the kop style east stand. Back of lower tier, or front of upper. Well these seats have gone already. The stats are 25% of these are kids seats according to the sales rep. Which is probably going to blow up like ppi did when the ground is a quarter empty. So we do our best to get the next best seats and fortunately for us there are two seats in the middle of what's sold out in the east upper tier about 20 rows back. Which is going to be about 3 miles from the pitch (Not sure of actual distance, sorry). I feel sorry for the next people to select as they are about 30 rows back. The only seats that are left in lower is the very front, but the sun will get you. They did make a point of saying the leaky roof will be fixed.

Does that person legally HAVE to evacuate in a situation like this or can they be a stubborn fool and refuse to leave their own property? 

I'm confused because during the somerset floods the environment agency ordered people to leave their homes, but then loads of stories of people staying put popped up in the news and there was even that case where a guy built walls around his home to protect it http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/16n08floods-460028.jpg

Suppose I want to buy a house in London, but I am concerned that prices are too high, and will come down at some point in the next five or so years. I want to buy a house because it is cheaper than renting, because I want control over my home, and because I would rather be paying my own mortgage than my landlady's. 

It seems to me that shared ownership offers a limited protection against a fall in house prices. Consider the following:

* I buy a 50% share in a house valued at £200,000 in shared ownership for £100,000.

* Next month, something happens (Meteor strike, market shock, Corbyn elected), and there is a big fall in London house prices – say 20%. My share of the house is now worth £80,000. 

* However, the share owned by the housing association (that I wish to buy) is also worth £80,000. When I am able to buy it, it will be cheaper for me: as my share falls in value, it becomes commensurately cheaper to buy the house outright.

**My Thoughts**

So just after five minutes (not sure exactly) we concede - Fuck, deflection. It was all going well as well. Then nothing much happened until 24 minutes then Man City score again - Yaya Toure twice! World class goal. Then it became pretty one sided. Half time James McClean came off - He wasn't too good to be honest and on came YACOB YAY! We improved for the first 10 minutes of the second half then boom - Vincent Kompany header out of nowhere. I felt like leaving but then again I thought Pulis would have some different tactics... But nothing much happened for the rest of the match.

**What I Learned**

* McClean pretty average along with most of the team.
* Nobody passed to Lambert when he needed it.
* Brunt stands off too much. We need Pocognoli!
* We need pace like Gamboa!
* Happy for Gnabry &amp; Rondon unveiling.
* Dawson still makes shocking passes.

**My Rating**

*5/10*

First game so I'm not worried but we could have done a little better.

**Also the ref was a bit biased in decisions?**

I'll be putting the top 5 or 10 leaderboard in the sidebar at some point in the next couple of days.

Not 100% complete but looks like he'll be off before the end of the transfer window.

Personally, I'm not too fussed about it. He is very talented but I think he's too much of a liability and would prefer to see Osborn/Reid in his position. 

We do appear to be going backwards in terms of squad strength though. It seems we are becoming a selling club which goes against what Fawaz is saying publically. It's a bit irritating when two incredibly youngsters are flogged for nearly the same money as Lansbury and no adequate replacements are even brought in.

Full spec is as follows:

* AMD FX 8350, stock clock (4.0GHz) [was OC'd to 4.5GHz but was reset in case the new user wanted to dabble with it themselves.]

* Ballistix Sport 8GB 1600MHz (2x4)

* Corsair H100i Watercooling Unit

* Corsair 750w PSU

* EVGA GTX 770 2GB

* Zalman Z11 Plus Case

* 6 Fans

* DVD Multi Writer

The system does have HDDs but they won't be included unfortunately. If required I can show the system booting.

Hi guys, I decided to make a survey to get your predictions for the season ahead and to update the demographics of the subreddit.

This is the kind of thing I'm very nerdy about, so I'd really appreciate it if you would take the time to complete the survey!

I'll give it a week before I close the survey and compile the results. I'll try and turn it into a flashy imgur album for you all, too.

It looks from your website that the tickets normally sell out before the date the general public can purchase them. Is this the case?
Would I be better off getting a ticket from StubHub or another ticket site?

I originally was going to see Millwall since it's closer to where I'm staying and the ease of a game that won't sell out but I've heard a few things about how they're not exactly the most friendly with Americans and I would hope that wouldn't be the case at Chelsea.

I hail from New York, I'm a fan of NYCFC. I want to dig into the BPL for the first time ever, and since I have no connection elsewhere I figured Man City should be my team given our sister-team status and since I want to see a quality group of players. It has been fun watching Angelino and Shay Facey do well for our team over here, but I do anticipate seeing them back across the ocean, so I have that to look forward to as well. 

What I would like to ask is if there is anything a new fan should know about the team. Who are particular players to look out for? What is our usual formation? What problems has the team been facing and what are our strengths? Are there players who are known for particular things (headers, free kick specialist, etc)? 

Also, do we have any rivals? Just generally, what should I know? I want to have an investment in the team, I like to know about the players and what the philosophy of the team is.

I was given a room on the 8th floor, which I was ok with. Later on the lifts became out of order and I had to walk up the stairs ever day which worsened my condition. The lift repairs where not done on time and instead of waiting 3 days I had to ensure for a week or so. I have also experienced problems with my accommodation such as fluctuating water pressure and temperature in the shower, and power outages.

On to of this, my contract was meant to end on 20 June, but I handed in my keys on 14 May, and requested early contract termination due to me returning home to receive physiotherapy for the damage caused to my leg for climbing the stairs. The accommodation services has refused to terminate my contract early and have charged me rent for 14th may to 20 jun on top of what I owe them, as well as refusing to give compensation for damages to my leg. They state that they were willing to move me to another room during the lift outage, but they didn't actually inform me of this until after the lifts were operational again.

If I do not pay the money I owe them by 20 sept, they will transfer my details to the UK debt collection agency. I have the money, but I believe that they do not deserve it, considering that I have not lived in the accommodation (I fully moved out and handed in my keys) since 14 may.

Strictly she just wants to do the designs and move on, maybe recommending a landscaper if they want or just leaving them with the plans. One customer needed her garden to be done within 25 days, my mum contacted a friend of hers who is a landscaper but was too busy to complete the work. As a favour to the client (who was already making a fuss over the fact she had the pay for the design) and out of desperation she offered to complete the work herself with various friends and family. However because she was not a stonemason (her father is but was unfortunately on holiday at this time) she had to find one, a friend from work recommended someone and she told the client and vouched on his behalf (perhaps a silly move, but it was just a recommendation). She quoted £4,000 for the whole project and asked for it up front and bought all the required materials (of which the customer got receipts for) and were delivered to the customer's house.

However all went tits up, the stonemason wasn't able to work with natural stone because it was not an even shape (however by using the bricks he had accepted them and my mum was not able to return them and my mum was told that they were well within workable limits). The customer unfortunately never had much trust in my mum or her friend and often tracked them as they worked, ensuring that they completed 'full' days. This all culminated in him doing bad work while telling the customer my mum was taking the piss with the costs and my mum trying to tell the customer he was doing bad work. He eventually stormed off and refused to finish the project. 

Since then the customer has been very difficult to deal with, she is blaming my mother for the builder claiming that she had brought him onto the project as a contractor therefore his work is her fault. My mum did not include him in her budget, which she has a copy of and did not agree to pay him, this was the customers responsibly. Furthermore she is blaming my mum for materials which the builder purchased and holding her responsible. In addition to this my mum and her friend did extra work on her garden (in days) which was not included on the original 25 day quote. The customer is claiming that this was included as it was part of the job agreement. 

In response to this we have sent a full break down of costs in relation to the original £4,000 which was transferred (including labour) and a invoice for the additional work, broken down into days. In an attempt to show how the money was spent. She still claims an extra £860 is unaccounted for, this includes the design (which she nicely refers to as 'drawings') and materials my mum did not receive payment for. We have also sent her a quote for the work to be corrected by my grandfather which includes a full breakdown of costs and labour (in days) with some terms and conditions, which the customer requested. The customer is outraged that my mum is asking for the labour costs when it's my grandfather and still blames my mum for the incorrectly done work. In the final email received today she has told my mum she will get a quote to correct the brick work which she expects my mum to pay.

We have spoken to the CAB and they suggested that we were not liable for the builders work and also recommended writing a letter from our point of view to the customer, which we decided not to send due to the customers agitated state (all caps email) would not help calm down the customer but convince her to seek legal advice. The customer has now said that she is seeking advice, the problem is she is fairly well off but we don't really have money for the bills, let alone a solicitor. If anyone could offer any advice regarding our liability, documentation we should send (if any), and what we should do now because we really don't know.",false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,null,null,self,[EAW] My mum offered to help a customer but now it's all gone horribly wrong,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/3gj8fu/eaw_my_mum_offered_to_help_a_customer_but_now_its/

I put together an interactive dashboard in case anyone wants to play with it. Only drawback is you need Tableau reader but its a free data visualization tool. It contains:

* League table, current and previous seasons.
* 3 upcoming and previous fixtures.
* Comparison of points obtained and goals scored this season versus the same stage during the past 3 seasons (user can select up to 5 previous seasons or as few as 1).
* Comparison of the results this season versus the same fixtures last 4 seasons. 
* Scatter plot showing relationship between number of wins and final standing, along with our current position.
* Color coded to show Europe Qualification and user can select any team, although why anyone would care about a team other than Liverpool is beyond me.


Positives so far? During the past 4 seasons, both Arsenal and Chelsea have won their past fixture 100% of the time, so they are already behind. The only time we've won ours in the same time frame is the year we finished 2th. Hope someone enjoys this sort of thing.

I want to create youth squad players that could make an impact for the first team within the next 3-5 years and try loaning them out and seeing how they develop.

My only problem is, I can't find a lot of information on some youth squad players. Such as height, weight and what would be good ratings to start with.

I have tried other websites like operationsports and such but there are not many people there who know youth Spurs so I thought this would be the best place to ask. Though I know some people hate FIFA talk on this subreddit so I am sorry.

My question is, who do you think would be a realistic choice to create, who can be an impact player in the future (that are not already in the game) and what do you think would be good characteristics for them (such as pacey, strong, ect..)

Do you believe in magic, in Coutinho’s heart?


How the goals can just save us, whenever he starts


And it's magic, if he’s scorin’ a worldy 


It makes you feel happy when it’s curled from forty


I'll tell you about the magic and he’ll bag a goal

But it's like tryin' to tell a stranger bout' Liverpool!

If you believe in magic, you know we can't lose 

It's the same old result when he put's on his shoes 

Just go and watch

It'll start with a smile 

And he won't stop impressing with that Brazilian style 

His feet start dribbling 

And you can't seem to find 

How the ball got there

Past the keepers line


If you believe in magic

Never walk alone with me

We'll sing until morning, just you and me

and maybe, if the fixture is right

I'll meet ya next weekend

I really feel like this campaign is a *''make it or break it''* year for Townsend, and if he doesn't succed this year around, we should move on  and look for a Shaqiri type of player. 

This is coming from a guy who was huge fan of Andros and i remember tuning into QPR games when he was playing there on loan just to see him play. I thought he was brilliant back then, but i must say he has really failed to show that type of decisiveness, skill, pace and end product here in Tottenham. 

I honestly do wish him well at spurs, but at the same time i wouldn't mind either giving Alex Pritch the nod ahead of him or replacing him this year with a Bellarabi, Shaqiri or Yaromolenko type of player now or next season.

The common rate was:

$25 per domestic cup trophy

$50 per league trophy

$50 champions league trophy

Most made the choice to donate to the Drogba Foundation. Which is a wonderful Non Profit. 

You make the rates. It can be a dollar or a thousand dollars.(one of us has to be rich). Every little bit helps!!!!!!

If you wish to participate just post your pledge in the comments section. I will send a reminder at the end of the season to all the people who pledge.

I live in a two bedroom council flat with my friend. Or rather I did, as she is in the process of moving out. She is the sole tenancy holder, all of the bills are in her name as she moved here in January 2014, and then she asked me if I wanted to move into the spare bedroom which I did in February 2014. I have a standing order set up between my bank account and hers to pay my half of the bills, but as I say, they are all set up under her name.

Anyway, I recently discovered that she is around £2000 in arrears in rent. What she's been spending it on, I have no idea. As I previously mentioned, she's in the process of moving out now, as she's going to live with her new partner. I would like to speak to the housing association who run this block of flats to enquire about whether it would be possible for me to move to a one bedroom flat in the building on my own, as there has been a sign outside the building advertising that there are apartments for let, so I assume there are a number of vacant properties. However, I'm hesitant to speak to anyone there and inform them of my situation in case they decide that because I have been living in this flat that has accrued a debt, that I can be held responsible for it as well. I had no idea this issue existed until I opened her post while she was away for the week a few weeks ago. Because my name doesn't appear on any of our bills or the tenancy agreement, I'm assuming that the housing association don't have my details, and I'd prefer not to advertise my existence if they're going to try and palm a hefty bill off on me.

Me and a couple of friends are opening a board gaming cafe with hundreds of games to choose from, custom built tables, beer and cider etc. We are currently scouting places to set up shop, with a view to opening within the next few months. Any ideas as to which areas might be good? We know Bristol well, though thought that you guys might be able validate our ideas.

Thanks

Edit: Many thanks for the feedback guys, I'll keep you posted as to where and when we open!

If he isn't willing to sit on the bench then come on if need be and I have a feeling that he doesn't want that, he should be moved on. If he is willing then of course we should keep him, he would be great to have in the team.

However, Can is the player we need in there now. He is able to tackle. He is able to go forward on the runs we see him make and has the legs to get back. Also with Milner and Henderson who are smart enough to sit in we have cover there. Rodgers has his game plans for this season set out. Lucas isn't part of these, and for the club to move on he needs to make way. 

Sorry for the rambling, and this is just my view point.

It took me a while to fully believe it myself but there are higher powers in football (football gods). They are the ones that make last minute winners happen. That's why Coutinho isn't really magic, he is just favoured by the football gods.

But there is one player that they specifically hate. Steven Gerrard.
I'll explain why I say this. 

The gods loved Stevie, they helped him win the Champions League in one of the greatest comebacks it has seen. Now they wanted to see Stevie win it all and to do this they wanted him to leave Liverpool. Gerrard contemplated it but was too loyal so they tried to convince him to leave. 

2 seasons later they took Gerrard to another CL final against the exact same team but lost to show Gerrard Liverpool was declining but Steven was still loyal. 

This lost him some favour with the football gods so they tried to hurt him harder than with a CL loss. They had him come close to winning the league but losing out to Liverpool's great rivals towards the end. 

Gerrard's hesitance to leave finally lost him all favour with all the football gods so they decided to torture him. They tempted away all his talented team mates to other clubs and left him to play alongside the likes of Charlie Adam and Jay Spearing.

That wasn't enough though. They wanted to scar him for life so 2013/14 happened. A season that would feel like a last chance for Gerrard to win a premier league title with Liverpool and make history. Going into the final stretch in the front they had him slip and cost us a big game that gave away the lead to City.

Now Gerrard has finally left but not in the way the football gods intended just to spite them. So will they let Steven have the last laugh? No. They will make him watch Liverpool succeed and make history months after he leaves as the cherry on the top of the revenge pie.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,[Conspiracy] Why we will win the league this season,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/3gkr5d/conspiracy_why_we_will_win_the_league_this_season/

So heres the dream... Basically I am 22 years old, 1 year out of uni and think I am on a good wage for my age (40k) and expect this to rise to 50k+ within the next year or two. I would like to get ahead and get on the property ladder as soon as possible, however the main obstacle is getting a decent deposit.

So I have spoken to a family member that may (nothing confirmed at all) be willing to invest up to £50-60k, enabling me to reach a 20% deposit. I live near a commuter town where it looks like the prices for a 3 bed place are 275-300k.  They would own the % of the house paid in and receive that % of any income that I get from the property. Furthermore there is some expertise in my family regarding property. 

I currently have a flatmate and I am in a relationship, and would look to take both of them in as lodgers. If the relationship ended I am confident I could quite easily find another lodger, but worst case I think I could comfortably make the repayments.

I am thinking in the longer term - say after 5 years, although all this could quite easily change - I would like to end up renting the place out. This would mean getting a mortgage with repayments that will be covered by the rent I would be receiving. I would like to overpay the mortgage for the time I am living there. I would then have to convert my mortgage into a buy-to-let mortgage?

At this point I would hopefully be at a point in my life where I could get a joint mortgage with a partner (obviously I would have to basically start saving for the next deposit very soon anyway).

So my concerns..

How would the lenders view the means that I would have got my deposit? I would save some money for the deposit but the majority of it would definitely come from the family member.

How do they view lodgers?

Would I tell them I plan to convert to a buy to let?

How naive/unrealistic am I being?

Sorry for the wall of text.

Personally, I like the guy, I think he's good for the club in the long run but I can totally see why people wouldn't like except for this little myth that's going around the fan-base that he alienates senior players and broke up a core of ""*world class*"" players in their peak since coming into the club. 

I just want to use this post to try and dispel (and discuss actually) the myth that somehow Rodgers moved players on too early, moved players on with more too offer and somehow ""*alienated*"" players.

**Pepe Reina**: Pepe was absolutely pivotal in the way Rodgers wanted to play in his first season in 2012 and if a goal-keeper was judged on his footwork and passing ability then Pepe Reina of 2010 would have been absolutely perfect. Reina was on a reported £100,000 p/w and his performances didn't justify those wages. His form dwindled rapidly, he made rash judgement errors (away at City springs to mind) and was dropped by Napoli on his loan move.

**Dirk Kuyt**: Rodgers was a big fan of Kuyt, but it was **Dirk's decision** to leave. Rodgers wanted to keep him if reports were correct at the time. Rodgers didn't push him out, leave him out, any of that nonsense.

**Maxi Rodriguez &amp; Craig Bellamy**: Both had expiring, high wage contracts, both wanted to go home. 

**Jamie Carragher**: Carra already had a job with Sky lined up, upon his retirement. He's said in the past that bench-warming drove him mad and he wanted to start every match (who wouldn't obviously) but Carragher was 35 at that point and Agger &amp; Skrtel were a safer option. Again, his decision to retire wasn't about Rodgers retiring and he made 7 more appearances (38) in his final campaign that he'd had with Dalglish the season prior (31).

**Daniel Agger**: Rodgers played Agger 39 (the most starts in his career since 2006/2007) times in 2012/2013 season. Rodgers tried to build the spine of our team around Agger, Gerrard and Suarez. When Sakho was brought in, it was made clear that the team needed more competition across all positions and after countless injuries, Agger left. There's some sour grapes there from the Dane in my opinion, I don't think he had the heart to compete for a place. But the exact same reason Agger lost his spot is the reason Sakho is losing his spot, so let's not pretend like Rodgers is inconsistent with his ruling. 

**Steven Gerrard**: He's said so many times that he thinks Brendan would have won him a league title in his prime. He made him the most important cog in the runner-up side and he couldn't keep up last season. Rodgers wanted to keep him, Stevie didn't want a bit-part. 

**Lucas Leiva**: It's sad but true, Lucas isn't the player he was [**EDIT: In terms of mobility and physicality caused by his ACL &amp; MCL injuries**] . Rodgers wanted to build the team around Lucas upon his return from injury in his first season. He's missed 79 matches through injury since 11/12 according to Transfermarkt. That's a huge amount of games no matter how you dress it up and that unfortunately not only affects how confident and consistent he's going to be as a player, but it colours the manager's view of you. If Rodgers and the club are trying to offload Lucas I'm sure it's nothing personal, just a logical squad decision when there are four more versatile central midfielders.

You may disagree with who they were replaced by when they did leave, but there's a whole lot of mixed up memories and revised history going on as far as the narrative of these players goes. It's easy to forget that we're a football club and not a fun-club, but realistically if players like Agger, Lucas &amp; Reina aren't needed or can't be relied on anymore; why should they stay?

1. Quidco / Topcashback
If you don't already use these then you absolutely should. They offer you cashback on purchases from hundreds of different merchants in the UK, just for clicking through to the merchant website from their site. You can get particularly massive amounts of cashback for things like switching energy providers, broadband/phone/tv packages and hotel bookings. You should always look on these sites before buying anything.

2. Credit cards
If you have a credit card then always pay it off in full every month. It is just not worth paying the huge interest on them. Shop around for the best credit card to suit your needs. Either get something with some kind of rewards/cashback if you're planning on every day usage, or look for something with good initial terms and no balance transfer fees if you have an existing debt you want to gradually pay off.

3. Foreign currency
If you're a holiday-goer then do not buy foreign currency in the UK (or buy a minimal amount if you absolutely need some). Things generally work out much better paying on card in foreign countries, as you then get the Visa/Mastercard exchange rates, rather than the horrible ones you get for buying currency. Whilst your bank may charge a small fee, you will still end up better-off by paying on card. I would also highly recommend looking at the Halifax Clarity credit card which I use for all my travels, which charges 0% for all non-sterling transactions and cash withdrawals. There are also various current accounts (I have one with NationWide) which charge no fees for cash withdrawal in foreign currencies.

4. Student loans
Don't ever pay off anything more than the minimum amount of your student loan. It doesn't hurt your credit rating, and it will always be the lowest interest debt you have.

5. Insurance
Never accept a renewal quote from an insurance company, whether that's car insurance, pet insurance, life insurance or anything else. They always put your premiums up and basically charge you for the privilege of not bothering to shop around. Comparison sites are a huge help. Also on the topic of insurance, only insure things that you would not be able to pay for. I.e. travel insurance and buildings insurance are hugely important. But do you really need mobile phone insurance?

Local welfare provisions were stopped by the local gov in April 2015 and we are at a loss as to how to help him with the basics for starting a home.

If I make an amazon wish list is there anyone willing to buy him a couple of spoons, perhaps a kettle or a sheet?

Not sure what proof people need but if people can think of anything please let me know and I will do my best to accommodate it!

Learning Oodles from you knowledgeable folk. And you're Generous with your knowledge. After a couple of months reading I'm finding this Skin Classroom fascinating. So helpful.

So - if anyone might be so kind as to advise  - 
Two quicky questions, please.

Which brand of Dermaroller is considered the best? 
One Amazon reviewer states it's 'Dr.roller'. But opinions on Amazon are conflicting.

And, second, which size needles would I need?

My skin is fine, fragile, ultra-sensitive. With seemingly invisible pores, translucent, very almost non-existent! This may sound real lucky but it's due to a genetic collagen disorder (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), which carries a ton of life-threatening problems, &amp; is a universal Pain. As for the skin, there's no natural lipid barrier or defence. I get through oceans of unguents.

But... Dermarolling.... I'd like to have a bash at just my forehead. Transverse expression wrinkles - sun-damage, too, i should think responsible. Those furrows i swear i created in just 1 Provence afternoon, at 18, under a raging sun.

So if anyone can advise on the best Dermaroller, &amp; which size needles, i can nab it off Amazon. And be most grateful to you.
(They say Angelina Jolie does dermarolling - &amp; oh I'm such a sucker when anything is Jolie'd by repute...)

A recent post on here got me thinking if any of you where aware of or possibly members of a local AVFC Lions club?
I think I've come across a bit of a good idea and want to throw it out there and see if anyone else is interested and it's something the Mods might be tempted to buy into?

I myself was a member of the Bromsgrove Lions before moving and now find it very difficult to arrange to go to matches etc with them, so I've been looking at a branch closer to my new home in Birmingham City Centre... my nearest is quite some way away.

I also see there are a lot of international fans on here that may want to come to the odd match, order merchandise from the websites or feel closer to the club.

This is where my idea formed, why now have a Reddit AVFC Lions club? We could all join up (it costs £5 a person to be a member for life), have our cards posted out to us (obviously have to pay a contribution for this) and take advantage of the perks (Holte Suite Entry if you visit villa park, possibly arranging to go to games together and lots of other odds &amp; sods throughout the year). 

Anyway needs some thought going into it to iron out the kinks, but there are other non-geographical Lions clubs (like the Armed Services group) so why not us?",false,avfc,t5_2s569,null,null,self,What about a Reddit AVFC Lions Club?,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/avfc/comments/3gl74x/what_about_a_reddit_avfc_lions_club/

I'm an American, and I will be going to university in the UK. I am also a minor (17).

Anyway, I've read [here (as well as other places)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440255/Final_-_v.9_overseas_BRP_leaflet.pdf) that minors need to be accompanied by a parent/guardian/responsible adult while collecting a BRP. The problem is that I will be living independently, and do not have any relatives/etc in the UK. 

What should I do? Should my university be able to send a 'responsible adult' along with me to pick up the BRP? That is the only solution I can think of at the moment. Or is there someone else I should contact?

EDIT: I'm also registered to pick up the BRP at my university instead of the post office, if that makes a difference.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Collecting UK biometric residence permit as a minor?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3glbre/collecting_uk_biometric_residence_permit_as_a/

What I have enjoyed so far has very much been surface level (“ooh lovely buildings, I’ll have a pint in this old pub, ok past time to get home now…”).

Anyone have any tips for really getting involved and making the most of that famous Oxford experience?

I don’t just want to make the most of Oxford but also Oxford University – it’s so vast and intriguing – but despite being a staff member it all seems closed off and hidden behind those college walls. 

Are there like…mixers? Is it ok to join university societies? Even if technically possible is it a bit weird for a 32 year old non student to want to do so? There is meetup too of course.

Greetings folks,

My parents and myself are thinking of going on a short 3-5 day vacation to England somewhere in November. 
I have only ever been to Birmingham due to my (now ex) GF living there but i know very little about touristic and cultural attractions in England. 

My parents are both senior citizens who like the idea of sightseeing English cottages, gardens, castles, cathedrals, museums, monuments, historical locations, etc. 

Any advice on locations/cities that sound like they would fit with the above description? 
Any do's and do-not's regarding visiting England would also be welcome.

Cheers! :)

IMO this line of recent posts/responses like ""At least we finished above the scum #thelittlethings"" needs to be toned down.

Let them make a fool outta themselves with the ""whose name is Harry Kane"" and co comments. I get it, its fun and adds to the spectacle. Good banter is always welcome but this is not banter, its pettiness. Its bad enough that if we go on r/soccer we get downvoted into hell because anything spurs is not deemed worthy by the single-minded kiddy supporters of Arsenal FC

Its not what we are about as a club, we dont go into their sub and downvote the shit outta their posts, we dont gloat about invading a poll and declaring ourselves the best team in the PL.

I'm looking for any advice, opinions or criticisms on my cash flow situation. I currently take home about £1,300 per month (sometimes a bit higher, rarely lower) but will soon be moving to a new job with a lower salary. 

I've tried to plan for this responsibly, and have managed to clear my outstanding debt as well as making a few cuts where I can. For the past few months I've been saving the difference between the two salaries to try and get accustomed to the level of cash that I'll have once I'm in the new job. 

The reason for my post is I'm just concious that I may have missed something or not taken something into consideration, and I would really appreciate any comments that you might have. 

My income and expenditure is as follows;

Income (Net): £1,300 (Soon to be £1,100)

Rent: £350

Council Tax: £80

Electric Bill: £32

Internet: £42

Bank account fee: £10

Mobile Phone Bill: £42

Groceries: £120

I put up with all the tourists doing touristy things and have no problem with it.

For the past few weeks there has been a 'one way' system being implemented outside the London Dungeon.

It consists of a two men standing at either end of a length (approx 8-10m) of barriers telling people that there is a one way system in play and that people should be following the rule.

Now as many of the commuters know when walking on your way home along the South Bank you are often walking faster than everyone else as so take the first opportunity to get ahead of the slow people.

I did that last night ignoring the so called 'one way' system and my backpack was grabbed from behind by one of the guys and told that it was a one way system.

I told him to let go of my backpack and tried to carry on walking at which point he grabbed my arm. I firmly asked him to remove his hand from my arm and he preceded to stand in front of me stating that it was a one way system.

I asked him if he had any paperwork proving that he was allowed to stop me from walking on a given section of what I believe to be Westminster Council's path.

He didn't and I also queried him about what legal right he had to prevent me from walking where I choose on that section of path. I even asked him to call the Police which he did not do and I asked him where are the signs stating that this is a one way system which he couldn't show me because there are none.

At this point his colleague from the other end of the barriers was approaching so I skirted round the first guy, he dropped his walkie talkie, and then I carried on past his colleague heading home.

I know he was not supposed to touch me as he has no right to do so but that's not the issue for me.

So is he allowed to stop pedestrians walking their own route?

I realise that this perhaps isn't a big issue compared to some peoples posts on here but any advice appreciated and fellow South Bank commuter stories welcome.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3193628/Chelsea-submit-latest-plans-60-000-seat-Stamford-Bridge-redevelopment-number-corporate-tickets-set-double.html 


According to the article our capacity will increase by 18,230 seats.
I think its a real shame that only 4000 more tickets will be made available to members and a pitiful 715 extra season ticket seats created.
According to the article there will be an additional 5931 hospitality seats for what I assume are for corporate partners. Then there will be the creation of a 'Club Chelsea Area', which will be incredibly expensive tickets that come with a bar service etc, in essence a prawn sandwich ticket type, this will account for another 6089 seats.

So of our 18000 extra seats, around 12000 will go to shareholders, corporate partners and will generally be completely out of reach for the average fan.

I understand completely the need to create additional revenue through expensive seating, and to that extent I think making a 'Club Chelsea' section makes some financial sense. But to give away even more of the ground to hospitality completely infuriates me. So much of the ground is already reserved for hospitality and corporate partners, its easier for American tourists to get a Chelsea ticket through their flight package than it is for someone who lives in London.

I'm completely in favour of a new stadium and I think the redevelopment plans look largely fantastic. But the ground is clearly being created in a similar vein to the Emirates. By making so few of the new seats available for ordinary fans the new ground looks like it will be a quiet, lifeless venue that we will have to pay through the nose to get tickets for anyway.

I ordered an engagement ring from the US, after advice from friends. I somewhat forgot that I would have to pay import tax on it. A rough calculation tells me that the tax due will be around £500.

I'm more than happy to pay this - after all, it's the law. My question is more, what are the chances that customs will pick it up and ask for the import tax? Previous orders from the US (for smaller amounts, but still over the taxable threshold) have been hit and miss in terms of tax demands.

First off, I need to go somewhere where there are jobs! I'm working in finance right now. I don't love it, but for the moment it's the most likely bet. So anywhere with jobs in that area is good (but again, not London).

I'm also looking for somewhere with reasonable rent. Doesn't need to be the city centre itself, just not a commuter town. I don't drive so decent public transport is a plus.

And finally, somewhere with a bit of charm is good. Not some modernist hellhole.

I've got a few days off and feel like renting a kayak for a half or full day.

Does anywhere nearby rent out kayaks (not canoes, rowing boats or punts)?

Ideally on a lake, so I can return it, or on a river with a pick-up/drop-off service, so they can return me to my car.  I don't feel like paddling against the current.

Nice and chilled, by the way - not some kind of whitewater madness!

I saw some truly grim places. Wouldn't keep animals there. Charging 800 quid a month for them, because London, right?

With a week to go, my girlfriend and I took a Monday off to find a place. The level of service, and quality of apartments shifted dramatically. Give an estate agent a call on Monday morning, and you get first dibs on places. I'll never flathunt on evenings and weekends again.

There was a catch. I am going to be homeless for a night. Plenty of friends offered to step in, but the girlfriend wanted a proper bed.

A few weeks ago, my work gave me a £200 voucher for one of them mostly bloody useless red letter days (I think they buy them at a massive discount, I'd personally prefer actual hard cash).

I'm probably going to have a budget of around £500 - £600, depending on whether or not I get put on the right tax code immediately. So, I'd like to get some prices for the following:

* A full or mid ATX motherboard
* An i5, but preferably an i7 CPU - probably an older one for this budget
* Mid-range DDR3 (DDR4 would be nice, but it's costly)
* A banging GPU. I'd give around a third of the total budget for this.
* An AIO cooling solution for the CPU - I'd like a double length, but a single length thicker rad would be sufficient
* A bundle of fans. Noise is irrelevant to me, although air throughput is a consideration factor.
* A decent power supply. I'm hoping for above 850W, silver standard will suffice.

Thank you to everyone that took part in week one!  We have a clear early leader, but the season is young and there's plenty of time to start playing catch up when we begin predictions for week 2 in a few days.

In the meantime, take a look at the leaderboard (click column headers to sort) on our wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/wiki/crystalfootball

While I've tried to take care about getting everyone's scores right I urge you to double check that your score looks accurate and let me know if there appears to be a mistake.

So MOT time comes around and when the car is inspected there is massive corrosion in the sub-frame, we are talking 3 inch holes, and it fails the MOT.

Now when the car is sold by Synter it first undergoes an MOT and a 135 point inspection by their team. At no point in either of these reports is there ANY mention of any sort of corrosion.
I have had an independent DEKRA report made for the car, and this is the conclusion that the engineer came to:

""The engineer concludes that, in his opinion the corrosion viewed on the Mercedes sub-frame would have been present at the point of sale and when the Mercedes was serviced in April, it may not have reached a point where it was penetrable or structurally unsafe.

However, the corrosion would have been visible and should have been rectified at point of sale.""

Sytner are claiming that it could of happened while I had the car and its more or less not their issue. Their communication with me has been awful, slow (they know I don't have a car now) and very passive aggressive.

If I take this further (court) do I stand a good chance at getting them to do the repairs?

UPDATE: So after mentioning that if there is no resolution made, I will issue a letter of intent to take this matter to civil court, they have finally responded with an offer of a ""£150 cheque as a gesture of goodwill"". At this point it is my thinking that if they are offering a cheque, they are hoping I will take it and run, and hence they don't like the idea of taking this to court.

Now here me out. Most of my political views are what people would describe as left wing i.e, green energy, cannabis legalisation, stopping most privatisation in NHS, etc. However I do have views that could be considered right wing i.e cutting foreign aid budget, controls over immigration.

What annoys me is the attitude among some of the hard lefties here (which let’s face it is allot of you) “LABOUR GOOD, CONSERSATIVES BAD” and allot of peoples mentality across the board of “I AM RIGHT, YOU ARE WRONG AND YOU’RE AN IDIOT FOR THINKING DIFFERENTLY”.

I cannot be the only one here to see all parties have some good ideas and terrible ideas. Stupidity, corruption, incompetence is not the trade mark of only one political party but is endemic to all of them. This conservative government has made some shockingly stupid decisions but labour had more than its fair share of them as well.

I guess what I am trying to get at is that if you view the world in black and white, left wing good right wing bad or vice versa you aren’t going to see the truth in anything.  The world is not black and white, it is a murky shade of grey so associating yourself as left or right is leaving you blind in one eye. 

Can’t we have sensible discussions on this subreddit anymore without bloody name calling and unbridled arrogance on either side. This subreddit  should be about hearing differing views and opinions and taking them all into account, not merely nodding along to whatever we agree with that reinforces our own views.  If you want your own opinions read back to you BUY A FUCKING TABLOID NEWSPAPER.

Rant over, love you all.

Previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3cbdy7/consumer_rights_advice_needed_about_broken/

So, following my last thread, I wrote a second letter on the advice of Trading Standards where I refuted several claims he made in his reply and that I was not prepared to accept a reduction in the cost of replacing the battery on the grounds that we were told it was new and I didn't feel we should have to replace it so soon. I again asked for a full refund and for him to respond within 10 days of receipt of my letter. This letter was sent on 15th July via first class recorded delivery and was delivered the following day, signed for by an employee of the shop (I assume). 

14 days passed and we heard nothing so trading Standards told us to write a Letter before Court once again asking for a refund and stating that we would be taking court action should this not be resolved. This letter was again delivered via first class recorded and was received on 1st August, signed for by another shop employee.

It is now the 11th of August and while I'm aware it hasn't been 30 days yet, I'd like to get prepared now just in case this does escalate to court action, as I suspect it might as we've yet to receive a reply.

Firstly, my main question is, do I have a reasonable claim and chance of winning? I'm aware that there may be costs involved so I'm concerned about how much it may cost and I'm worried that if I lose, I'll be out of pocket twice. 

Does the fact that our letters to him (clearly addressed to him specifically) were signed for by other employees make a difference? As in, could he claim he never received them due to being signed for by other people, and would this work in his favour?

I also can't prove that the scooter was faulty straight out of the shop (which is the basis of my claim) but I do have a photo on my phone from the 29th April (it's dated on my phone) showing my mother on the curb of the pedestrian crossing, with her pressing on the 'forward' lever and showing 1 green light out (meaning there should be 75% battery life and thus it shouldn't have died - it had been fully charged overnight). This isn't definite proof I understand but would this photo be considered decent evidence of our claim? 

Something I should point out however, is that we were never given a receipt. We originally intended to pay in installments and made our first installment (which we do have a receipt for) on the 11th April, but we ended up paying in full for it on the 18th April and receiving it on that date. Would the fact that we don't have a full receipt for it be a problem? The receipt from the 11th shows the full purchase price and that we paid a £20 deposit. 

And lastly, what should I expect? I've never had to take anyone to court before so I have no idea what's involved. I've done some reading about it but it's fairly vague so I'd be grateful if anyone had any insight about the process? 

Apologies for the length!

I can't tell an employer how I've made money for the last 8 years.  I have never left a job on good terms.  What kind of jobs can I realistically get?

I guess you would say I've fucked around a lot in my life.  Essentially I'm a bedroom stoner, and programmer/web developer/designer, who never leaves the house, and lives off the grid.  However now I've got a kid in school, and I want to knuckle down and start getting a proper employment history.  I'll do really basic stuff, but not sure if I can even get that.

If I were being honest, my CV would actually look like this:

Born in 1983.

Native English speaker.

Near perfect spoken French.  Pretty bad written French.

No driving license.

12 or so GCSE's grades B-C.  No other qualifications of any kind.

No criminal record of any kind.

Piss poor credit score.

**Job History:**

**1983:** Born.

**1996-1999**: Paper-rounds, and so on in my teens, while frequenting hacking forums, and teaching myself C and *nix.

**1990-2002:** 6th form.  Dropped out 1 week before completing a BTEC in computing.

**2002-2003:** Unemployed smoking weed, reading, and learning to program and hack *nix on my own while being supported by parents.

**2003-2003:** Worked in a call centre for 3 months.  Quit by not turning up one day, and ignoring their calls.

**2003-2004:** Unemployed while sometimes signing on, sometimes being supported by parents.  Coding, gaming and smoking weed.

**2004-2004:** 6 weeks in a call centre.  Quit by not showing up, and ignoring their calls.

**2004-2006:** Unemployed, coding and gaming.

**2006-2006:** 6 weeks as the captain of a passenger boat.  Quit after an accusation over moonlighting (I was).

**2006-2006:** Another call centre for 2 months.  Quit by severing contact out of the blue.

**2006-2007:** Unemployed.  More coding, and gaming.  Lived off girlfriend's benefits because she made more on her own than both of us together.

**2007-2007:** Got invited back to the second call centre, and forgiven.  Quit by severing contact after 4 weeks.

**2007-present:** Living in an off-the-grid nether world, while my girlfriend pretends she's single, and has no sub-tenants so as to not get evicted.  No signing on.  No work.  Always coding, reading and gaming.

**2007:** Set up a YouTube channel for a relative with a hobby.

**2009:**  Realize that the YouTube channel has accidentally become really popular.  Realize that I've accidentally become really proficient at several programming/scripting languages, graphic design, video editing and promotion.

**2009:** Learn some basic SEO, and get a website to the front page on Google for some high traffic searches.  Now I have a business that's making £700-£1,200 a month.  Try to find out how I can pay tax, and be a proper business etc, but can't without jeopardizing girlfriend's tenancy, so just keep living in this scary nether world of no paper trail, where I'm a homeless tax dodger with a small business.

**2009-present:** various web dev jobs for friends, paid cash in hand.  Still living in this stupid ""off the grid"" state.

**2014-2015:** Got rid of the business' gave it to a friend to run.  Now above board with housing/benefits/tax.  Want to a get a real job, and then take the business back, and pay tax, and be a somewhat normal person.


In short, I'm a fuck head.  Like I say though, I want to actually go and work now, and contribute to society.  I'll happily put boxes on the back of lorries, or stack shelves, or sell double glazing over the phone.  The trouble - even with those jobs - is the kind of questions they're going to ask.

They're going to want to know how I made my money these last 8 years, and I can't really say anything.  ""So if you haven't been working, and you haven't been signing on, how are you still alive?"".  Also, ""how come you only lasted a few weeks at these jobs?"".  And ""Is there not one employer you've left on good terms we can ask for a reference?"".  Not to mention, ""Why is your last P45 from 8 years ago?""

If they don't check, I could just say ""I've been a freelance web developer for 10 years"", which is pretty much true, but then they're going to want to know ""Why the fuck do you want to work here lifting boxes if you're a web developer?"".

So my questions are:

1.  What's the best way to dress up this CV?  Can I just say I was freelancer, and expect to not have to prove it?

I'm due to move to Birmingham from N. Ireland to start a new job in September that's close to the airport.

I was told initially that the job was in Solihull so was looking at accommodation there but looking at a map, Marston Green looks a lot handier. I'll be bringing the car over with me and will likely drive to work.

I was wondering if anybody could tell me a bit more about those areas. For example are they nice? Are they safe? Is there much in the way of shops and things to do? 

If I was to commute to the airport from Solihull, is out likely to take long? Google says it's about 25 minutes, but I've no idea what to expect of rush hour or even what direction the traffic travels in rush hour. I would happily live a bit father away and travel in the opposite direction to traffic on order to have a more pleasant commute.

If you know a bit about the city and can help me out, I'd really appreciate it! Or if you could recommend other areas that I could commute to the airport from relatively easily, that'd be awesome too!

Only just stumbled across this sub whilst searching for advice. Pleased to have found it!

I think this is a classic question to get asked but here I go. Situation is..

I'm 27, doing my Mod 2 in a few weeks and need to get a bike (my 125cc got stolen and written off so I need to get a bike asap for practical reasons). Anyone got advice on options that are best for fun, budget and insurance (I now have no no-claims)? Bikes I've come across:
-Yamaha 2014 XJ6 pre-reg 0 miles for £4.9k
-Kawasaki ER-6 F 14k miles, great condition for £3.4k
-Yamaha MT-07 (can't find any 2nd handers) for £5.4k new
-Kawasaki Ninja 300 brand new at around £4.something-k
-Lots of people talk about the SV650 but I don't really like the look of them physically I mean :(

I should also say, I need to commute a short distance (&lt;10 miles) through Birmingham city centre a few times a week on it but would also like to take the bike away for a weekend somewhere nice every so often and maybe stick some saddle bags on it etc.

Are there any options I'm missing? I don't want to spend more than £6k for the bike.

Thanks in advance for your collective wisdom!

**UPDATE**
Hi guys I thought I'd just update you all as you all took time to provide advice. I went and put some money down on a Yamaha XJ6 yesterday. It just seemed to fit the bill all round and I managed to find a brand new, 2015 Diversion S for £4999 which seemed like a truly unbeatable price for how much you get.

I mean, I liked him as a character. Entertaining, dark but funny, etc., but he felt kind of disjointed from the tone of the show itself.

Starting with episode eleven, I think that was fixed. From him showing the Doctor's capacity for forgiveness near the beginning to all the fantastically grim jokes that had nothing to do with the Doctor (""iPads? We have Steve Jobs"" and ""Sounds like somebody donated his body to science!"" plus people all over the world lining up and paying to take pictures with Cybermen) the whole thing managed to suck me back in when I'd kind of just drifted away from Doctor Who. Up until now, it felt like the show wanted to kind of go in that direction but was pulling its punches. One of the things I always liked about Doctor Who was that the world kind of changed a little bit from Doctor to Doctor, showing the universe the way he sees it. Now we have a Doctor who's got a bit of a cynical streak, but still with that romantic attitude deep down, so we get a world where there is real, meaningful love, but sometimes it takes sacrifice, we get a world that's funny and tragic at the same time.

Plus, even though I figured it out very early, I enjoyed Missy's reveal. ""I didn't know there was a match on.""

A bit of background on my situation; I stopped being a student last year and entered the big wide world. Didn’t have any money, just a debt in an interest free overdraft, so moved back in with the mother.


The work isn’t great around here, and I struggled to find anything. I got a part-time job at minimum wage to see me over, getting about £330 a month. I paid £120 a month to my mum rent, £30 a month IVA for a student grant overpayment, £17.50 a month mobile phone payment, and spent my spare time volunteering to get experience. During that period I was living paycheck to paycheck, and had to use my credit card occasionally to tide me over. My overdraft is still interest free, and I was still well in to it.


A couple of months ago, I got a job thanks to the experience the volunteering, and I will now get £1400 a month after taxes. I had my first paycheck last month, completely paid off the credit card (£419), paid my mum the rent for the month (she’s now charging £250 now my wage has gone up) and the overdraft will be reduced by a few hundred once the month has ended.


My situation now; this new job is quite far away, and is causing me a fortune and a lot of lost time commuting, on top of the rent my mother is charging. I have a friend who lives in the same town, and is moving into a new flat, and offered to let me move in, this flat within walking distance of my new job which would be £312 a month, with around £100-150 a month in bills. That would leave me at least £900 a month for living expenses, and paying off debts, then saving. I’ve been living off £100 a month without paying food, so this is loads compared to what I’m used to.


The problem is my credit rating is now shot to pieces from the past year, and never borrowing money before this, I also will need to buy a certain amount of furniture, half the deposit, and half the first month’s rent up front, and I don’t have this kind of money at the moment, but I won’t nearly get as good deal as this again in that town and it’s a small but lovely and safe flat.


At the moment I think my only option is to ask my friend to put the flat solely in her name, then get a bad credit loan, and pay it off as soon as possible, along with the IVA (which has around £200 left on it) Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Myself and Mr Balf have been doing regular box splits for a while now, generally one per month, the rules we agreed between ourselves are.

* each takes a turn ordering

* payment upfront before ordering

* add £5 to cover shipping

* if there's an odd cigar e.g. a 25 count box the person doing the ordering keeps it

* if there's a tax bill it's paid equally by both

I'm seeing an increasing number of people on the sub ordering from overseas and I'm thinking it this arrangement might be convenient for other people e.g. you may not want to buy an entire box but splitting with someone else would be ideal.

Some time ago I setup a second private sub to facilitate something similar, as it turned out we were a bit thin on the ground at the time to make it work, but I'm wondering if there's enough people now to make it viable. For context, per month I've been spending around £30-£60 and been getting between 5-12 cigars per order, depending on quality and vitola of course.

My general idea is that perhaps once per month (after everyone's payday :) we arrange some box splits, I'm also thinking we'd be best doing this in private rather here on /r/ukcigars.

On that note, I have spent the last 6 hours or so creating [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mE277zwG-HVVoDy_uTNVyzlWBWEJfcyU_LHq6b5X7Ek/edit?usp=sharing) which details lots of things to do with Liverpool. Essentially, it lines up our fixtures this season with our performances in the corresponding fixtures in our previous six seasons (the past three seasons - i.e. the three with Brendan at the helm - hold more weight than the three before that) in order to *hopefully* provide a good indicator of what we can expect this season, and more importantly, how our actual results differ from the expected results (either positively or negatively). 

It works out our average points haul per season, then adds or subtracts values from the total we can expect based on how we do in each game vs how we should expect to do; so for example, the win at Stoke has given us +3 points and +2 goal difference on an average visit to the Britannia. It also takes into account (although, there isn't a lot of emphasis on this) the matchweek that the game is played in; Stoke is +3 points and +1 goal difference on an average opening weekend for LFC. I've included this in order to provide some statistics for the fixtures that there are no statistics for (e.g. against Bournemouth) and to try to get to grips with the fact that we always seem to go on a bit of a run after Christmas. It's worth noting that this average data is calculated using the total goal difference of the fixture rather than whether it's a win, loss or draw - perhaps something that could be improved on?

I've included statistics about the points and goal difference thresholds needed for each of the top 7 positions (taking an average over the past ten seasons). So, the good news is that our current win percentage of 100% is more than enough to win us the title. The bad news is, that according to my calculations, we would need to win our first 13 games in a row in order for the spreadsheet to predict us enough points to come first *in an average season*. As it stands, with the win at Stoke (and ignoring the currently irrelevant win percentage) our predicted points puts us fourth, while our predicted goal difference puts us fifth - so roughly where everyone in the world thinks we will end up.

Now for my request. I'm not the best at excel, so I've made the google document open for editing if you think you can improve the spreadsheet - just please don't mess with the statistics (unless, of course, you spot an error, in which case, by all means!). Hopefully, with your input, /r/LiverpoolFC can come up with a reasonably accurate tool for predicting this and future seasons.

I'm hoping to start learning to drive in the next few weeks. I'm from Derry City and have heard from multiple people that it's pretty much impossible to pass on the derry test routes.

It would definitely be time consuming but I want to pass within a reasonable amount of time. Can I learn to drive in Derry but do the test in Coleraine? How would that even work?

- What happened to Clara being quick-witted and fiesty?  She was *killer* in the Season 7 ""Asylum of the Daleks"" opener, and I've liked her since.  This new uninsightful, somewhat bitchy, damsel in distress is *not* the Clara I've come to expect nor enjoy. 
- To top it off, the [ending spoiler #2](#s ""head droid speared by a building and then a quick shot to the Doctor JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T JUMP"").  Really wished they'd ended the scene with the bowler hat floating through the wind, panning upward to [ending spoiler #3](#s ""show the Doctor standing alone in the doorway."")
- Oh, and suggesting Clara knows the doctor best just to set up the ""I don't think I know him anymore"" line.  Weak shit, Moffat.  

Is this what I am to expect from the rest of the season?  The amount of insipid fluff (looking at you, Strax...) drove me nuts.  I can only handle so much of this back-and-forth between ""wow Capaldi is cool!"" and cringing of second-hand embarrassment during the next scene.  

With that out of my system I feel better.  The important question now is ~~have there been any similar murders~~ was this episode indicative of the rest of the season?
