Before getting into it I just want to say that we have not read any spoilers or anything online so this is purely speculation.  Also, I've read similar theories but nothing that is quite the same as this one.  If someone has please feel free to provide a link.  My co-worker and I would be really interested.

I've heard a lot of theories about Clara being another face of River Song but I haven't read anything about River Song being another echo of Clara.  I think this makes sense because:

1. The first time The Doctor met River she saved him which is a very Clara-like thing to do.
2. River said ""If she's really dead, then how can I still be here?""  Perhaps referring to the psychic link, maybe referring to the fact that they she is an echo of Clara.
3. Every instance of Clara has lived a full life and eventually grows into the face of Clara we know and love but River Song is a Time Lord which means her face changes all the time.  If you look at young Clara compared to young River they look similar.  (They are played by different actors which does go against the theory but I don't think it is a major deal breaker.)
4. River knows The Doctor's name but he never told her.  Clara read his name so this could explain why.
5. River knows all of The Doctor's faces because Clara has seen them.
6. Madame Kovarian NEEDED River to be ""the woman who kills The Doctor"".  Perhaps she knew they had little chance of success but at least River would get put in jail.  If she is in jail, she can't be in The Library to save him.  Or perhaps it is just because Clara's timeline is so interwoven with The Doctor's that she is the person closest to him and therefore the best chance they have of killing him.

Of course in order for this theory to work there needs to be some reason why River seems to remember things learned by the original Clara.  Perhaps this could be the fact that she is a Time Lord but I don't really know.  Agree?  Disagree?  General thoughts?

TL;DR My friend and I think River might just be another echo of Clara.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Doctor Who Theory (Theoretical Potential Future Spoilers),2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1nejtt/doctor_who_theory_theoretical_potential_future/

I'd like to see us keep the same lineup, except sub Hendo with Lucas spot and let Llori try his hand as wingback. He's got the pace and he's capable of attack.

If Allen were totally fit then I'd choose something more conservative and place him up beside Stevie and let them hold, with Stevie essentially covering Lucas' responsibilities, allowing Allen to roam around to link up with Victor. With Gerrard's below-par performances maybe we ought to let him use his vision to control the tempo from our own half and let the youngins do the work that they've been doing so well

I can also understand why first instinct would be to bring on a 4th defender, but I think the key to maintaining the attacking momentum we've picked back up with the return of Suarez is to outplay with the ball rather than off. We need to restore confidence in the final third.

I think Jamie Hyneman, Adam Savage, Mike Rowe, Louis C.K., and John Hodgman would be great as panelists. If I had to pick a host, I'd go with Hugh Laurie because of his history with Stephen Fry and his popularity with American viewers.

Edit: I came up with a pretty long list of people I'd love to see on the show, and I thought I'd share it with you all.

* Stephen Colbert
* Mo Rocca (or anyone from ""Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me,"" for that matter)
* Jon Stewart
* Garrison Keillor
* Patton Oswalt
* Colin Mochrie and/or Wayne Brady (after all, Greg Proops and Clive Anderson have been on ""QI"" already)
* Ken Jennings
* David Hyde Pierce
* Neil DeGrasse Tyson
* Harry Shearer
* Michael McKean
* Bill Maher
* Seth MacFarlane
* Richard Ayoade
* Jeff Corwin
* the Mythbusters cast (including Kari, Tory, and Grant)
* Ira Glass
* Drew Carey
* Conan O'Brien
* Michael Ian Black
* Maria Bamford
* Mindy Kaling
* Bill Nye
* John Oliver
* Russell Peters
* Margaret Cho
* Larry David
* Jerry Seinfeld
* Seth Green
* Janeane Garofalo
* Jeff Foxworthy (he's actually very intelligent; he can't bring Larry the Cable Guy, though)

Panelists from the original UK series could also be featured, of course. I think David Mitchell, Jimmy Carr, Sean Lock, Phil Jupitus, Rob Brydon, Dara O'Briain, Noel Fielding, Jack Whitehall, and Bill Bailey would all be hits with Americans, and a lot of people still remember Rich Hall from ""SNL.""

In an ideal world, too, there would probably be celebrity guests who aren't really comedians (Americans do like their celebrities, and doing a panel show would be a great opportunity for self-promotion for them, much like a talk show), but I could think of a few big names in America who would be good guest panelists:

* Tom Hanks
* Kevin Smith
* Quentin Tarantino
* Natalie Portman
* Howard Stern
* Ashton Kutcher
* James Franco
* Matt Damon
* Robin Williams
* James Woods
* John Krasinski
* Ken Jeong
* Steve Martin
* Seth Rogen

I feel like an American version would oddly enough come across as a more ""Never Mind the Buzzcocks"" sort of show, i.e. a showcase for regular comedians/the host as well as celebrity guests who aren't necessarily funny, but are at least interesting, entertaining, and, of course, famous.",false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,null,null,self,Who would you cast in an American version of QI?,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/quiteinteresting/comments/1nexhy/who_would_you_cast_in_an_american_version_of_qi/

1. How strict are the bouncers with ID? Can i use my australian drivers license? or would i require my passport? (or would it just depend on how the bouncer ""feels"".
2. I'm watching a channel 4 show on bouncers, they seemed to detain and search a suspected drug dealer. Do they have the legal right to do such a thing? 
3. In terms of clothing. Is jeans, white shoes (not runners), and a round neck t-shirt okay? Or will it just depends on the club? Do you guys wear a jacket/jumper or just tough it out until you enter the club?

EDIT: for the record, our state drivers licenses are pretty secure [example from the net](http://www.michael-munday-fraud.com/images/michael_mundays_drivers_license.jpg). Double photo, hologram, not laminated like a 3rd world state like queensland :P

This is fine and all, but it seems like we are focusing too much on single performances rather than the whole team.

Today it was Henderson and our Captain. Last week it was Aspas, the week before that Sakho...

I'm all for constructive criticism but we surely can't expect players to be 100% every game.

Take Gerrard for example for today's game against Sunderland. People are saying he was not impressive. I watched the game again and this is what I saw:
1st goal was from his corner, and the 2nd goal was from a BRILLIANT pass to Sturridge. His Free Kick was also a bullet that could have been a goal. Also for the 3rd goal, his positioning was excellent and he was ready for a tap-in off a rebound if Luis had not scored. Go watch the replays. 

Henderson also puts in 100% every game and running full steam at 90th minute. Notice again the 3rd goal him sprinting from behind drawing defenders away from Suarez. His crosses weren't the best, but there is absolutely no excuse for some people on this subreddit to say he doesn't have a creative bone in his body. Are you kidding me? We are fans and we are allowed to criticize, but let's not throw hyperboles around either.

My girlfriends birthday happens to fall on the day of the Doctor and we're going to have a dress up for the event.

I have dreads and I don't really want to shave them for the night, so I'm thinking an Ood might be the costume for me. Don't have to talk and can have a straw in my mouth all night. 

Will tie some of my hair in front of my nose for the tendrils (how to get them the right colour temporarily?) The rest will be tied up in lumpy bits and put under a flesh coloured swimming cap (unless someone has a better idea?)

The costume itself is a little tricky. Any have an idea of an article of clothing to alter to pull the look off?

You may have a few years of experience under your belt or you could be fresh on to the market, but what is most important is that you have a special something to offer this company and a commitment to learning, developing and growing. You will need to be open, friendly and an excellent communicator with the confidence to put forward ideas and contribute fully within the team.

The reason I messed up my A levels at 17 and 18 was because I didn't really give a shit and I didn't really have any idea what the point of uni was, however I always had a natural aptitude for Psychology and Sociology in class and always did the former extremely well.

I have 100% realised the error of my ways and I want nothing more than to achieve the very best from my Access Course, acquire degrees in Psychology and Sociology and find a job in the relevant sectors.


I'm not even a month into my course yet and we have only just registered our UCAS accounts, but what are the best universities to study BA Psychology at and which universities welcome mature students as well as an Access to Higher Education diploma too?

I have been in the UK since 2009 and my work is currently about to renew my Tier 2 WP for an additional 3 years(expiring in 2017).

My question in regards to this is that after next year (2014), I will be eligible to apply for British citizenship (February 2015) and I would like to do so. I understand that I will need to pass the Life in the UK test and I am prepared to do so. Because my WPermit will be for three years, do I have to wait for this to expire before being able to apply for citizenship or can I circumvent the WPermit and apply for citizenship one year into the WPermit since I will be eligible?

I was unsure if I had to wait for the full time on the WPermit to expire before applying or not.

With that in mind, over the course of the next 5 years -- if we get ahead of ourselves in this debate! -- could we conceivably win the Premier League and start a new era for this great football club?

I've been talking to one of the couples chosen (the only Canadian couple!), and thought it couldn't hurt to post about them here. 

There's a pretty steep entry fee that wasn't heavily publicized, so while Amanda &amp; Brandon Armstrong would really LOVE to attend the event and represent Canada (the organizers are trying to make it as international as possible), they might need a bit of help. Amanda is one of the co-founders of the Doctor Who Society of Canada, she and her husband are HUGE fans of the show and would love to do a vow renewal for the 50th. They were recently interviewed on CTV Ottawa and will have a newspaper article coming out about them shortly. 

Their blog and donation page are copied below. Mods I didn't see anything against this in the posting guidelines so I hope it's allowed (and if not I apologize and am happy to remove the post).. they're just a really sweet couple and I'd love to see them make it to the wedding. :)

A little about my real life: I work full time in an Investment Bank as a structuring and pricing tools developer writing programmes that price fixed income products for Barclays. Asides from this, in the little time I have left, I commit most of it to getting better at this game I've loved for 7 years, with sight of reaching the top of the UK scene one day!

Asides from putting up with the infamous Dreadshite, Reason was real fun, a good group of lads (as I'm sure a lot of you can vouch for), who were really determined to get better. We've had some good results and really stuck with it to become the team we are now. I myself came straight from pubs with little to no competitive Dota 2 experience all, so achieving what we have done is a real sentiment to the practice, practice and more practice we've put in. i49 was truly the highlight in terms of fun and achievement for us, a great event which I encourage any of you who have never been to a LAN to experience at least once.

Sadly all good things come to an end - I've really struggled to juggle a 50 hour/week job as well as giving enough commitment a sponsored team deserves. Because of this I've decided to call it a day, and crawl back to playing pubs in the hole I belong :P and letting Dota take a back seat in my life giving me time to concentrate on other things. Despite our recent disappointing results in the UK invitational I can assure you this had nothing to do with my departure. I had already planned my departure prior to this tournament, but was going to wait till after the completion of it before letting people know. I was (optimistically) hoping we'd win it, to avoid all the awkward speculations that I'd rage quit the team based on the recent lack of results we've had :P All respect to ROTK for knocking us out though, they played solidly throughout the series so far and really took us by surprise showing the UK community how far they have come in the past few months. ROTK vs wat a stack going to be a great final :)

I sincerely wish the best for Reason, and hope they can bounce back with an even stronger and better team. Hopefully they can find a mid player who doesn't need +190 gold pooled every game to win his lane ;D

This has been my first contract, so I've never really had to deal with this before.

Basically, I got my contract 2 years ago when I lost my shitty phone, and was desperate and stupid and broke, and signed up to the first contract I saw, which was £50 a month (yup) with a free iphone 4s.

Now, my iphone in it's current state, is unbroken, unscratched, well taken care of - but a little tiny bit glitchy. As in, I don't know how much longer it will last. 
EE have been awful to have a contract with, constantly raising the bill, basically broke my phone for a good couple of weeks (long story), offering me deals which they can't follow through with, etc. 

So, my questions is, should I a) suck it up, get a upgrade with EE, give my old iphone to my boyfriend who badly needs a better phone, b) go with a new network, get a shiny new phone etc, c) keep my phone, get a cheap giffgaff sim and just buy a new phone out of pocket when my phone eventually breaks, or d) remove all electrical equipment from my life, go Amish, and live a stress-free life?

The police didn't issue him with a fine, claimed they had no camera in the car to prove he was speeding, but then followed that up with ""if it happens again we'll seize your car"" and saying he'll get a letter after the officer ""speaks with his sergeant."" 

We're just wondering if they were bullshitting since they seem to have no evidence to make any sort of warning stick?

Also my dad is convinced he sat on a gun when they brought him into their car, it was heavy metallic and in a leather case, with one of the officers being incredibly eager to take it off him when he handed it to them, is this a possible point of complaint for improper weapon storage or something?

I got no idea why they are friends

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Becali the owner is very controversial

ie: ""In September 2007, Becali sparked controversy when he insulted parliamentarian Lavinia Sandru, stating that she should ""go and become a candidate for the ring road, not for the European Parliament"", a veiled reference to prostitution.[46] He has also remarked that a woman ""has no more value"" after she has given birth to a child.""

""He was also widely criticized in the media for asking, ""Why [are there] so many homosexuals? I'll give two or five million dollars [for a referendum], so we can finish off all homosexuals in the country""


becali went to court today to see if his sentence is extended and gave a prediction for today's score http://storage0.dms.mpinteractiv.ro/media/401/581/7953/11429509/3/gigi-becali1.jpg?width=815

Exhibit A:  Sue Perkins performs the ""We are [being behaved]! You just put it in your mouth!"" Liza:""""You're just thinking too dirty!""

Perkins gives an incredulous look at Stephen while Tarbuck looks away with a shit-eating grin on her face, satisfied with the trump card having been [played,] (http://i.imgur.com/RS5xcDz.jpg) then both look at him smugly, to sit back and watch how his reaction—regardless of what it may be—makes him look more and more the party guilty of having his mind in the [gutter.](http://i.imgur.com/8du0e9d.jpg)

Stephen kicks into a Stephen Frynzy and calls the women out, immune to their feminine wiles: ""[That's](http://i.imgur.com/HUDBOao.jpg) what girls are so good at, it's the innocent, wide-eyed...'[*I*](http://i.imgur.com/7R3vvZM.jpg) was just—ooh! oh! [*You're*](http://i.imgur.com/7VUztoS.jpg) the one who...'""

At first, Tarbuck forces out an attempt at a genuine [laugh...](http://i.imgur.com/gW4MTpw.jpg)but it quickly [deteriorates](http://i.imgur.com/UpwVPSL.jpg) until her expression looks to be one of [humorless contempt.](http://i.imgur.com/VCyLAiW.jpg)

Stephen lets out a joking [""Ooh!""](http://i.imgur.com/X6CPjAa.jpg) in mock irritation, and when he continues on to the next item, we see a shot of Sue Perkins and Liza Tarbuck [exchanging glances and incredulously chuckling at being called out](http://i.imgur.com/eHqtca2.jpg), likely an attempt at saving face between them by pretending that they thought it was a silly and inconsequential observation by Stephen, and tilting their noses up as though they are simply above it and have no [reaction](http://i.imgur.com/7G5y8Ui.jpg), Tarbuck pretends to scan the audience as though she has her thoughts on something else and didn't even notice.

(I swear I'm not over-analyzing that last bit, that reaction by the two of them is unmistakably one I'm familiar with among friends, done to save face when one has just been embarrassed by someone...trying to show how you don't care in the least and/or hardly even noticed the event)

I think good ol' Stephen really put them in their place! Of course it's all in good fun, but their reaction just makes me smug that they took it so seriously and Tarbuck is obviously a bit bothered by it! (Also I have to confess I don't really like either of them at all...still though I think this little exchange is juicy either way).

* Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

* Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

* Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.",false,canterbury,t5_2sbso,null,null,self,A note on Reddiquette.,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/canterbury/comments/1niggd/a_note_on_reddiquette/

Lots of midtable movement again this week, but once again **ThePlays** hold on to first place, although perennial contenders **Slumdog Mignolet** cut their lead to just 22 points after a strong showing. They're 33 points clear of **ArtyParty**, who drop to third after having a rubbish time of things. There's a three-way tie for top scorer between **Hibbo4EnglandFC**, **Bob Martin's Blues** and  **Omicron Persei 8 FC**, all of whom achieved 78 points with the visitors from another world returning to the top ten for the first time in a few weeks, as do the **Fookin Mint XI**. Meanwhile, **Smash Em** find themselves out of the top 15 for the first time after a poor week saw them drop to 27th.

####Biggest movers:
**Bob Martin's Blues** and **Metalingus FC** were the strongest performers, both jumping 20 places, while **Nick's Team** rose 16 places to fight their way out of the high 50s for the first time. **Dynamo Chicken Kiev** had a shocker of a week, scoring only 17 points and plummeting 26 places, and **Rangers United FC** dropped 17 places back to 38th, which seems to be a regular position for them.

So, my mod two is not far off, and I have started viewing bikes with the intention of having my bike ready to go as soon as I am.

I settled on three bikes; the GSR600, XJ6 600 or the SFV650. I was told that the best one of the three, for a new rider would be the GSR. Also seem to be cheaper than the two alternatives (including insurance). I love the look of the bike and how it feels, but it seems impossible to get the thing restricted.

I will be on an A2 license, which means that the bike must be restricted to 47 hp(35kW), and because the bike utilizes fuel injection, rather than carburetors, the restriction is done through an additional ECU.

This ECU was fitted for free by Suzuki when people bought the bikes new, but nowadays they are pretty much impossible to get my hands on. I've tried dealers and franchises, ebay and all the other marketplaces, but nobody has one for sale.

Would the air restrictive ""washers"" work like in older style bikes? Or would that ruin the engine? Is anyone aware of any other methods to restrict the bike to satisfy the DVLA and provide a restriction certificate? This is the only thing stopping me from handing over the cash for one of these bikes.

Somebody please help me!  ",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,GSR 600 - Restriction help required,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/1nips6/gsr_600_restriction_help_required/

I left 6th form not because I didn't have the intellectual capacity for A Level (I excelled in Psychology in the few months I was at 6th form), I just didn't know what I wanted to do and because nobody in my family had ever been to University, it was sort of a foreign entity for me and I didn't think it mattered.


After working two jobs I hated in the space of 2 and a half years, I realised that I was wasting my potential and that I needed to get back into education and study Psychology again.


The Course I'm on is called Humanities and Social Sciences HE Diploma and I chose to study Psychology, Sociology and History as well as the two other mandatory units. 


I've never felt so committed to anything else in my life and I realise I have really hit a gold mine with this free chance to get back into education and I simply won't let it slide through my fingers.


Therefore I fully expect to achieve Distinctions (the highest possible grade) in all 3 subjects that I undertake. 


Last week I was browsing at Universities and getting nowhere, nothing really screamed out at me and I want the best possible University experience simply so that my learning can excel.


I stumbled across Psychology BSc and Sociology BScS courses at the University of Manchester and I checked the entry requirements. They requirements for the Psychology are to have grade B GCSE in both Mathematics and English Language (which I do) and they require at least 2 distinctions and a merit also.


I have only been on the course for 4 weeks and the first 2 weeks didn't involve too much academic stimulation so it's fair to say our tutors haven't had much time to judge our intellectual capacity.


My friend tells me that when I apply for Universities that I will send my predicted grades to the University and they will decide on that basis. However, my GCSE's weren't great and if my tutor uses them to guess my predicted grades, I'll likely be predicted merits and that won't be good enough for Manchester.


I was just wondering if there was anything I could do in the way of upping my predicted grades, I will obviously work my arse off in class and I am ridiculously committed to achieving all Distinctions.


What will happen if I get predicted merits and Manchester tell me to bog off, but then I end up with all Distinctions.

**Welcome to the match thread for this UEFA Champions League game. It is the second game of Group E of the 2013/14 season.**

*Chelsea travel to Bucharest in Romania for their third game against Steaua in the space of six months. Chelsea lost away in the first leg of the Europa League round of 16 1-0, but turned the deficit around in the second leg winning 3-1 and 3-2 on aggregate. Chelsea went on to win the competition. Chelsea lost the first match of this Champions League season in a shock home defeat to Basel, so will want all 3 points tonight. Steaua lost to Schalke 3-0 last time out, and will just hope not to be the whipping boys of the group.*

The former is rather easy in that they tend to have all sorts of misc items that yell ""SCOTLAND!"" on 'em, but the latter... well, I'd have to jot notes.  A *lot* of notes.

At a quick glance I remember The Whisky Trail most of all because it had a friendly and passionate staff... but it also had the most expensive bottles.  As in, theirs were 5-10 quid more expensive than other nearby places.  One place sold Lagavulin 16 for something like 35, they sold it for 40.  Which to me is a pretty substantial difference.  5 quid here, 5 quid there, hey, that's a lot of beers!  And who knows how much more they charge for other bottles...

Is there any place that's ""local-trusted""?  Well-priced and not necessarily catering to tourists?  I'm not sure how much I can expect since I'm arguably in the most touristy place of Edinburgh I think, but it's worth a shot to ask around...

I know that I do not automatically have British citizenship by birth, but I was wondering if anyone might know if visiting armed forces have any special status in the United Kingdom, such as [leave to remain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_leave_to_remain#Children_born_in_the_UK) or [right of abode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_abode_(United_Kingdom), that might make them seem [legally settled](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/othernationality/Britishcitizenship/borninukorqualifyingterritory/). From what I can ascertain, my parents' potential special status could grant me British citizenship (or at least an easier time of applying for citizenship or a passport).

Some of the roadside boxes in my area are being hooked up to fibre (BT Infinity etc.) with the big signs being attached to them. However when I check [the online checker](http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/broadband/infinity) it looks like the roadside cabinet I'd be connected to hasn't been upgraded yet.

Is there any way of checking which roadside cabinet I'd be connected to, and when it's going to be connected up to fibre? The [rollout page for the main exchanges](http://www.superfast-openreach.co.uk/where-and-when/) is useless because my exchange has been fibre enabled for like years, but the actual roadside cabinets have only started being connected up in the past few months.

If it's never going to be upgraded (or it's going to take like 6-months), then I'll have to bite the bullet and upgrade to Virgin Media 120MB and then broadcast my stream in a lower quality.

I'm on a salary of £26,000, I only have about £750 in savings. Which is just stored in a Nationwide Saver Plus account (which appears to only have a gross interest rate of 1.25%, I swore it was more...). I have a Student Loan debt of about 25K, which is currently being paid back by about £60-70 of my monthly income.

I currently spend most of my income on living costs (I rent a flat near London so it's expensive), so upwards of 1K a month is untouchable. The other £500-£600 tends to just disappear as I'm still settling in after moving out to live with my fiancée (there was no option to live at home and save, my parents sold the house and have moved away).


So what should I do? A financial adviser told me to set my pension up ASAP, as the younger I do it, the better. My employer will match something like 2.86% which I understand is basically free money. It also helps that money going in to the pension is removed before tax (I think?). The pension scheme at work will create a personal pension with Scottish Widows, I am not sure if they're a good company or not.

I only worry about the pension, as I have some (perhaps irrational) fears that the money I put in, will be worth tuppence when I retire and/or the company will go bust and my money will simply disappear.


Another side note: I've never had a credit card and only a tiny overdraft which I have dipped into and then straight out of a few times in the past. I've been told by companies before they cannot sell/contract things to me as I don't have a good enough credit history. Should I get a credit card, use it for everything and pay it off in full before any interest on the charges hit?

Anyway, my skills are mainly in the backend, but I really don't mind doing front end stuff at all. I'm very proficient and have around 3 years experience in PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, MySQL.

I also have experience in using frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation. Have plenty of experience in making responsive designs and creating templates from wireframes. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to PM or email me!

I just moved to Brighton from overseas and I'm in need of a haircut. I've walked past some hairdressers but you can't really judge them from the outside.

**Gylfi Sigurðsson**

&gt; Away from Arsenal, but staying in north London, many would have predicted that Gylfi Sigurdsson's days were numbered at White Hart Lane following an influx of midfield talent at Spurs this summer. While the Icelandic star may yet drop down the pecking order, if he continues to score goals that earn Tottenham points it will be hard for AVB to leave him out. With 3 in the league already this season, his average rating currently stands at an impressive 7.33.
&gt; 
&gt; That figure is up from a meagre 6.51 in the previous campaign having only started 12 of his 33 league appearances. He's already matched his trio of league goals from 2012/13 with his average shots (1.6 to 2.6), key passes (0.8 to 1.2) and dribbles per game (0.2 to 1.2) all on the rise. Having adapted his game to play out wide, he's reaping the rewards with a run in the first team, but with Erik Lamela and Nacer Chadli breathing down his neck, Sigurdsson can't afford to allow his form to slip. 



**Hugo Lloris**

&gt; Completing our top five is another Spurs player and our fourth from either of the north London sides, goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. The Frenchman is the second-best shot-stopper in WhoScored.com's ratings thus far with his figure of 7.33 up from a fairly lowly 6.66 in his debut season at the club. No other regular first-choice keeper made fewer saves per game last season than Lloris (1.88) who, in contrast, has averaged 2.83 this season.
&gt; 
&gt; That increase comes despite having kept a joint high of four clean sheets so far this term and he's been beaten just twice, in tough matches against Arsenal and Chelsea respectively. Having made a total of 17 saves from just 19 shots on target faced this season, Lloris' save success rate of 89.5% unsurprisingly leads the way of all keepers in the league and Spurs' bid for a Champions League berth may well rely on their solidity at the back, ending with their dependable last line of defence.

Hi everyone

 

I will be coming from Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA to see Chelsea take on City.  I had a few questions that I was hoping some of you could help with:

 

 

1.  Match day- what are the best places/pubs to go to before and after the match?

2.  We got our tickets off of livefootballtickets.com - does anyone have any experience with them?  I am praying they are legit because they were very expensive.

3.  We are staying at the Millenium hotel about 2 miles from the Bridge, what would be the best way to get to the stadium or best place to get dropeed off?

 

Any other general advice or suggestions would be great.

 

Thanks and can't wait to get to your side of the pond!

 

Greg

6' - Ribery is an asshole. 1-0 Bayern.  [Gif](http://i.imgur.com/vHabE9Q.gif)

19' - Bayern fans are heard chanting for Mario. They miss us having Balotelli of course.

22' - Neville seems to be enjoying watching this a lot more than us thrashing United. Still think he's a plug.

29' - Gary, shut your butthole.

31' - Robben just misses a pass to Muller who would have had an open net. Yet to touch the ball.

36' - Bayern win every second ball and getting to all our clearances first.

39' - Muller dives, Kompany is not impressed.

41' - Navas' long pass goes awry. Bayern with enough possession for us to charge them. 

43' - Yellow for Aguero, cheap for me

44' - Ref calls a foul on Richards

45' - Yellow for Kroos on Navas

45' - Dzeko struggles with Bayern's high line is deemed offside when Nastasic play the ball back in.

45+ - Fernandinho makes a good tackle and the ref calls another foul. Referee seems whistle happy. Frustrating. The players are frustrated as well.


**SKYSPORTS Half-time Analysis:** 

Gareth Barry is a special guest and says we are not playing well but suggests a counter attack goal would be a big lift.

Jamie Redknapp is happy to lay in to us venomously after Barry says this. What a tit.

**Second Half**

46' - Fans singing 'na na na naaa, Cityyyyyyy', we win a corner, Richards kicks Dzeko in the face and the ball 

47' - Another corner for us, doesn't come to much, but Aguero makes a great tackle in his own half on Muller and they battle away.

49' - Another corner for City, Navas picks up the second ball. 

52' - Nasri stands strong and makes a tackle.

53' - Clichy makes a strong tackle and Bayern have a corner, Robben curls one just wide. We eventually earn a goal kick.

56' - Clichy lets Muller walk in behind him and Muller walks around Hart. 2-0 Bayern. Fuck Bayern.

Substitution: Negredo for Dzeko

60' - **ROBBEN** makes it 3-0! Hurray!

I'm only updating for goals, watching us get cut open

Milner and Silva on, Aguero and Nasri off

Terrible tackle by Dante on Silva, no call

79' - GOAL NEGREDO! 1-3

86' - RED CARD BOATENG. YAYA WAS FREE! Three games does not feel like it's enough.

Silva hits the bar!

Milner puts a cross Negredo heads just wide.

Not in January. Not ever.)*

As Liverpool fans, we're often accused of over-relying on our storied history as a means of emphasizing our club's greatness. But can you blame us? From Shankly to Paisley (EDIT: to Fagan) to Dalglish to Benitez, our club's trophy cabinet is stocked with tokens of memorable league campaigns and brilliant European nights.

For the younger amongst us, the Liverpool sides of the mid-to-late-2000s hold a particularly fond place in our memories. Istanbul, of course. The Gerrard Final. The second leg of the 07 Champions League semis against Chelsea at Anfield (""REINA SAVES IT""). That run of success was followed in the summer of 07 by Liverpool's purchase of ""El Nino"" himself, Fernando Torres, from Atletico Madrid. What followed was history: Torres scored 50 goals in his first two seasons at the club (the fastest to ever reach that mark), and an injury-hit third season saw him score 18 goals in 22 Premier League games -- an astonishing rate. That year, Liverpool came within four points of being crowned Champions of England once more (FUCK YOU, KIKO MACHEDA).

Everyone knows what happened next: the Fat American Cowboys robbed us for all we were worth. Xabi Alonso left for Real Madrid, depriving us of the secret weapon that, though we didn't realize at the time, made our team work. Alberto Aquilani (I'll leave it at that). Liverpool finished 7th in 2009-10; Torres battled through incessant injuries and still managed to score 22 in 32 total appearances. He underwent surgery on his meniscus twice that year, and was never the same.

As the years have gone by since Torres' departure from Anfield, we're left with magnificent memories: the spectacular goals against Blackburn and Sunderland; the demolitions of Madrid and United in the same week; his out-muscling of Rio Ferdinand to put us 1-0 up on United at Anfield while playing on a bum knee; scoring twice against Benfica in the Europa League on a torn meniscus before undergoing surgery later that week, never to be the same player. His departure from Anfield nine months after that Benfica match was acrimonious, to say the least, but can we blame him? He knew he wasn't going to be the same. He knew he had a chance at one last, big contract before his career was effectively over. He knew he had a real chance at silverware, which he wasn't going to get at a club very much in transition at the time.

Now, we find ourselves in the dying months of 2013; summer has turned to fall, and fall will surely turn to winter. Liverpool are in 2nd place in the Premier League, fielding the best side we've had since that long-lost 08-09 campaign. We're riding the creativity, guile and quality of Coutinho, Suarez and Sturridge in our quest to bring Champions League nights back to Anfield. But there are issues in the side: we're dreadfully thin in attack. If we field Suarez and Sturridge simultaneously (which, hopefully, we'll have a chance to do plenty this year), we're left with only Iago Aspas on the bench as another striking option. I think Aspas is quality and will eventually prove himself at Anfield, but Iago Aspas and Iago Aspas alone simply does not represent top four-quality options at our disposal.

So what do we do to strengthen in January? Do we go after Palermo's Abel Hernandez, Suarez's countryman and a player who scored four goals in a game at the Confederations Cup this summer, who's also reportedly available for a mere 4 million pounds? No. Just because you start for a Serie B side doesn't mean you have what it takes to compete at the highest level. Do we go after other, younger attacking options, like Bilbao's mercurial Iker Muniain or Internacional's much-hyped Leandro Damiao? No and no.

No, the answer lies in West London, where a great talent has been obfuscated and diminished by a regime that doesn't know how to use him and a fan base that doesn't appreciate him. Fernando Torres is the answer. While he's not the same player who left Anfield by any stretch of the imagination, he's still a world-class talent who's won at every level of the game. He's found opportunities inconsistent under the string of Chelsea managers he's worked under, and things don't seem to be much different under Jose Mourinho. The recent addition of Samuel Eto'o, the imminent return of Romelu Lukaku next season and the near-certainty that Chelsea buy another striker in January only exacerbates that fact.

Form is temporary, class is permanent. In Torres, Liverpool would get a skillful player who's familiar with the club and it's culture. He's Spanish, so of course he can fit into Liverpool's possession-based style, which sees the team dominate sides like Stoke and Sunderland for the full 90 minutes, taking the game to our opponents incessantly. He may not be a world-beater anymore, but we don't need him to be; he'd serve as cover for Suarez and Sturridge when they're unavailable, and would be ready to pounce off the bench after 70 minutes when one of them needs a rest or when we need some more bite in attack. Fernando Torres *on the bench*-- could you imagine? Our strike force would be the envy of all Europe. 

He could give Sturridge pointers on how to improve, how to reach heights at Anfield that he himself once reached. He would be in Suarez's ear, telling him how Liverpool is the club to be at, how no other group of supporters in the world love and appreciate their heroes like we do. Stevie would be giddy as a schoolgirl; the Gerrard-Torres axis would ride once more, older but wiser. Add all this to the fact that we'd almost certainly get him for around 40 million pounds less than we sold him to Chelsea for, and it would be a brilliant piece of business.

Shhh. Can you hear it? Reverberating around Anfield once more?

I got time on my hands here and so do you if you read this. Let's go.

I. I will retain the split season structure with Season 7A having 5 episodes and S7B having 8 with an Xmas special in between the two halves.

II. I think the ""Impossible Girl"" arc was a sound idea but it was half-assed, especially by S5 and S6A standards. It was flat and hit a narrative brick wall every time it was addressed.

Arguably it started in ""Asylum of the Daleks"" with Oswin. It was weird to see the new companion actress so soon before she actually became the next companion. The IG arc didn't really really start until ""The Snowmen,"" when The Doctor recognized that something weird was going on.

What if Clara returned sooner in ""A Town Called Mercy?"" Consider that Sheriff Crichton sacrifices himself to save The Doctor. What if that was Clara? The Doctor, Amy, nor Rory know what Oswin looked like, so they would have no reason to suspect anything. We the audience now know something is up. We'd be in a mutant state of dramatic irony yet be barely a step ahead of The Doctor and his companions.

In ""The Power of Three,"" The Ponds settle down while The Doctor wants to go on adventures. What if Rory had a dream in which he remembered a woman who looked a lot like that Clara girl they met in Mercy? When? Maybe during those two thousand years he guarded the Pandorica in that alternate timeline he still remembers. Maybe he was in Pompeii when some lava monsters attacked and she helped him but was incinerated? Just a thought.

This lights a fire in the Doctor. Rory remembering that prompts the Doctor to recognize Oswin's voice as strikingly similar to Clara's. That plot point now happens earlier.

The Doctor tracks Clara down to Manhattan in the 1940s, where he brings The Ponds. He cannot find her in Manhattan though and it's too late as The Ponds are trapped in a paradox. It's not until after they are caught by the angels that he sees his Impossible Girl's gravestone, how she's been dead for over half of a century.

Distraught, The Doctor grieves in Victorian London (a half century before the 1940s). He meets Clara once more as in The Snowmen, and unlike what actually happened, Clara lives. Victorian Clara adventures with The Doctor instead of modern Clara.

From there I imagine that the Impossible Girl arc would be largely the same. By being Victorian Clara, we have a more interesting Clara because as mentioned before, this one is actually from the 1940s but found a new life in, say, the 1880s or 1890s after being caught by an angel. She has issues and a different cultural base from most modern companions. Bonus: those fucking kids don't need to exist.

If I were to change anything else, I would have The Doctor and Clara run into a different Clara or Oswin in Nightmare in Silver. This way we see yet another one and the peculiar situation of them running into each other. Plus it could fix her abruptly inconsistent characterization.

III. The other big thing I would fix is the presence of The Great Intelligence. Like Clara, it's spread across The Doctor's timeline, yet we see less of it than even her.

A couple of themes running through S7 (A in particular) are The Doctor erasing himself from records across the universe and running into other infamous ""Doctors."" He meets Doctor Filch in Dinosaurs on a Space Ship, that fugitive doctor in A Town Called Mercy, and Doctor Simian in The Snowmen.

I think The Great Intelligence could have taken a background role in DoaS. Someone to appear on a screen for Doctor Filch to report to. Hints at a greater menace that is after The Doctor, but it doesn't come to a head until The Snowmen. Think of how Doctor Simian appeared in ""The Bells of Saint John."" Like that, but a couple more times and earlier.

I would suggest further that he appear again in The Power of Three, where he has a hand in that invasion. Again, a hint at a bigger menace played by Richard E. Grant.

The Great Intelligence would be revealed as before in The Snowmen, as would Doctor Simian's identity. As with Clara, I think The Great Intelligence should have returned some time before The Name of the Doctor. Unfortunately I'm not sure of that one.

IV. So let's put this all together.

* Asylum of the Daleks - We meet Oswin, who dies without her face being known.

* Dinosaurs on a Space Ship - Doctor Filch reports to Richard E. Grant whose identity is a mystery.

* A Town Called Mercy - The Doctor and The Ponds meet Clara who sacrifices herself to save The Doctor as he is almost killed by a cowboy terminator after a fugitive doctor. Sheriff Crichton lives.

* The Power of Three - Rory remembers a Roman woman who looked like Clara. The Doctor remembers Clara's voice as being remarkably similar to Oswin's. He smells a mystery, and after resolving the invasion (which in some way involves Richard E. Grant) he tracks Clara/Oswin to Manhattan.

* The Angels take Manhattan - The Doctor is too late as Clara was already caught by the angels but she lives in the Victorian era now.

The Snowmen - The Doctor finally catches up to Clara who becomes his new companion that he wants to figure out, especially since it cost him the lives of The Ponds. But what's more, The Great Intelligence is revealed, but what is its agenda?


This all culminates in The Name of the Doctor. The Great Intelligence spreads himself across The Doctor's timeline, Clara pursues him. This creates a few revelations. First, Clara saved The Doctor in A Town Called Mercy because The Great Intelligence was behind that plot. He stopped her in turn in The Angels Take Manhattan by tipping off the angels. You never see the both of them in the same episode until The Snowmen when neither knows the other. They are in an intertemporal game of chess (which The Doctor plays against the Cyber Controller in Nightmare in Silver by coincidence) over The Doctor's life.

V. In conclusion, I think those changes, mostly in 7A, would have given intrigue and narrative flow to the show, thus making it more interesting and memorable. I realize that part of the idea behind Season 7 was to have less serialization, but I think what storyline it had was half-assed.

It's not perfect, but I think it would be better and would reward rewatching in a similar way to S5's finale.

The AC Ajax result was perfect for us yesterday. Now onto a double header v Ajax then a home game v AC. I think 7 points might just do us from these games. 

Then hopefully Barca are already through by the last game and pull the same stunt they did last year against Benfica and play a youth squad. That will be our best chance of beating them abroad.

Not to mention how unlucky we have been in our first two ties against the group favorites. 

* Barcelona 6pts

* AC Milan 4pts

* Ajax 1pt

* Celtic 0pts

AC should pick up zero points v Barca in both games and I'm hoping Ajax pick up no more than 1 from us. That would put us level with AC when we host them in Celtic park.

-Milner should start next time because of his crazy workrate and physciality, also can keep the ball well, plus he could help cover clichy

-Silva can help distribute the ball well and as soon as he came on things changed a lot (but it was too late by then)

- Silva and Milner can swap positions too if neccesary since milner can cross and silva can place incisive balls pretty much anywhere he is

-We need to beef up midfield next time so a 4-3-3 is more appropriate because bayern where able to cover and dominate the centre of the pitch

-Pantilimon because that was an exceptionally poor showing by heart

-fernandinho did quite decent in breaking up attacks given the circumstances and this formation would give him a role similar to that of lahm's last night


So what do you guys think city can do next time we face bayern/ what formation should city use?

I've been cycling now for a couple of years, first with a singlespeed and now with an 80's road bike. My commute is pretty much a 7 miler either way, but i'm really looking to expand this and start doing a bit more. Ideally I'd love to confidently sign up to an Audax next year.

I work next to Regent's Park, but that's a bit boring to do by myself, so I'm now looking to join a cycle club for long rides etc. I have no idea how fast I am, but I would say that I am definitely not slow.

Does anyone know of a cycle club in Central/West London that would be ok with someone such as myself (a novice!) joining in? I've been looking online (eg Kinoko Cycle Club), but feel a bit daunted by all the descriptions.

I've left a relationship with a girl who couldn't give two shits about football. Worth mentioning of course, that's not why I left her. I've been seeing this new girl for a while and she's never taken an active interest either.

So, whilst out somewhere nice with the new girl I convinced her to go watch the Spurs/Chelsea game at a local pub. I explained that there's alot more to football than most people realize. I explained the Student vs Teacher drama with AVB and mourinho (easier explained that way) She didn't need alot of persuading and sounded eager to see what the fuss was about. It felt nice that she would even entertain the idea.

She really got it! She was jumping up and down with anticipation at every missed chance. Turning once in a while and telling me how tense it was. Jeering with the rest of us at the Chelski pub fans when their goal was ruled offside. Feeling the pain when they inevitably scored.

We walked out the pub, to the front seating area in search of a lighter. Found one with a happy couple of spurs fans who invited us to sit with them. I sat back and watched her get involved with the Torres red card discussion, our performance, how tense it was. She even nicknamed David Luiz ""Side Show Cunt"".

I guess proud is the word I'm gonna use? 

It's a trivial thing to have your girl support the same team as you but I fucking love her for it!

\- Original post follows -

Hello everyone.

After [reading about the case of Helen Measures](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukbike/comments/1nm4z1/driver_walks_free_after_killing_oncoming_cyclist/), who has just walked free from court ""not guilty"" after she overtook on a blind bend at 50mph, and killed a 21-year-old riding her bike with her boyfriend in the opposite direction - by driving on the wrong side of the road! - I decided I'd had enough.

[This Government's attitude to anybody who doesn't happen to be in a car is lacking](http://thecyclingsilk.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/why-am-i-angry.html) (and yes, I do drive as well as cycle, I love both and don't want 'war' with anyone). But it's putting vulnerable road users in substantial danger, and often simply refusing to punish undeniably dangerous drivers. This court case particularly has caused outrage amongst London legal types on Twitter - it's effectively set a precedent that killing cyclists with a car is allowed.

So I'm talking to my MP Norman Baker tomorrow afternoon (who happens to be a key figure in cycling policy). I need your advice on how to make a constructive argument for real change to him.

See [what I wrote in r/ukbike](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukbike/comments/1nna0k/rukbike_i_am_talking_to_my_mp_norman_baker_key/):

&gt;I know that a lot of people have limited faith in our democratic process. But I have to try, or else failure is just that bit more likely.

&gt;Pumped with aggravation, I phoned his office after [reading this case](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukbike/comments/1nm4z1/driver_walks_free_after_killing_oncoming_cyclist/cck50hd?context=1) about yet another driver allowed to kill and walk free, not guilty.

&gt;He's now talking to me at 4:45 PM tomorrow and I want to know what issues to (constructively) raise with him about this Government's attitude to cycling. I don't want to miss anything so I'm asking you all to hit me with your ideas.

&gt;I once heard in /r/unitedkingdom that how seriously an MP takes your issue can be categorised by how you raise it:

&gt;&gt; **Least important**

&gt;&gt;*Chain email* (eg, petition boilerplate template letter)

&gt;&gt;     v

&gt;&gt;*Original email*

&gt;&gt;     v

&gt;&gt;*Typed letter*

&gt;&gt;     v

&gt;&gt;*Handwritten letter*

&gt;&gt;     v

&gt;&gt;*Phone call*

&gt;&gt;     v

&gt;&gt;*Appointment in person*

&gt;&gt;**Most important**

&gt;My constituency is Norman Baker, Lib Dem MP - ex-Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, current Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Transport in this Coalition Government.  
I feel that he has rather a lot to explain.

&gt;I have a phone appointment with him tomorrow now. For the first time, I'm going to discuss this Government's cycle policy.  
I am the last appointment of the day, so hopefully I will stand out in his memory, maybe he'll even sleep on it.

&gt;I need some advice on what to say. So far I have -

&gt;- Cases like this one, and CPS/sentencing guidelines (why always ""careless driving""? why such a low conviction rate?)

&gt;- Sustainable transport funding - see his fiddling the figures the other day to claim we ""spend more than the dutch"" (pffft!) vs. the Welsh Assembly's excellent Active Travel Bill

&gt;- The fact that car journeys cannot grow indefinitely, and people *need* excellent infrastructure and the support of law enforcement before they feel safe leaving the car at home - I know loads of ""Halfords cyclists"" like my parents who enjoy casual cycling very much and often say they'd love to shop/commute by bike, but are shit-scared of the busy 60mph roads

&gt;I'm aiming for a constructive argument rather than an angry rant. I want him on-side and pushing much harder for change.

Alan Hansen

Graham Souness

Kevin Keegan

**STATS:**

Anzhi have failed to win in twelve matches in all competitions this season, drawing seven and losing five.

Tottenham have only lost once this season in all competitions away to Premier League leaders Arsenal.

Anzhi have not kept any clean sheets at home this season.

Tottenham have never won against Russian sides away from home (1 draw, 1 loss).


---
0' - Match begins.


8' - Slow start for us; Anzhi trying to get lucky with counter attacks. Chiriches doing very well stopping them.


24' - We are having a little trouble getting the ball in the final third. The Anzhi defense has been lively.


28' - Anzhi player gets in the box and beats Sandro, but Lloris sweeps the ball from his feet easily.


31' - Holtby tries a curved shot from outside the box and looked like it was going to go in the top corner but the Anzhi keeper just touches it to make the save.


33' - **GOAL DEFOE!** Holtby plays a controlled through ball to Defoe and he quickly slots it in.


40' - **GOAL CHADLI!** Walker puts a pass towards Chadli from inside the box and Chadli taps it in easily.


44' - Walker does the same type of pass towards Defoe but Defoe misses his kick. Should have been 3-0 Spurs!


45' - **HALFTIME! Ref decides there will be no added time and ends the first half early? 2-0 Spurs.**


45' - 2nd half begins.


47' - Holtby picks up a knock. Harry Kane likely to replace him.


59' - Lamela has been very hesitant to take a single shot despite the opportunities he has been given. Defoe what have you done to the boy? /s...


70' - *Dawson and Siggurdson on; Kaboul and Lamela off.*


77' - *Eriksen on; Holtby off.*


80' - Doesn't seem like we're playing to score at the moment; similar to the 2nd half we had against Chelsea.

**90' - FULL TIME 2-0 SPURS.**",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Spurs vs Anzhi: Match Thread,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1nns2w/spurs_vs_anzhi_match_thread/

Using the comments section below, submit your photos for Picture of the Month. The photo must be your own work and be your best or favourite representation of Wales and Welsh Culture.

The photo with the most upvotes by **midnight October 10th** gets featured on the sidebar (where you can see last month's winning submission by /u/Stickerbox ), until it's time for next month's, in which it will be added to the list of Pictures of the Month to come in the upcoming wikilist shindig.

The submitter also gets **a month of [reddit Gold](/gold)**. La di da.

---

**Rules**

* No theme this month. The photo can be anything as long as it's Welsh and it's taken by you. You don't have to be Welsh, but the photo does.
* Photo submissions must be the root comment in any given comment thread - Don't post your submissions as replies to other people's submissions. It gets confusing and I am *very* lazy.
* It must be your photo. No pilfering photography sites
* It must be 'appropriate'. No hi-res genitalia please.
* It must be at least 300x200 pixels, but the higher the resolution the better! I mean, within reason of course.
* Captions are welcome and encouraged, as they will be included in the 'about' section
* Please be kind and courteous of other users' submissions
* Use your upvotes wisely! The most upvoted submission will most probably be the one we choose, though this is at the discretion of the mods.
* Don't be nasty and downvote images just 'cause they're not yours. That's totally not cool

---

If you suspect foul play feel free to [message the moderators!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FWales) That about sums it up. We look forward to seeing your submissions, Good luck! /u/CaptainDjango &amp;&amp; /u/Chwedl

---

**BREAKING NEWS**

Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first ever /r/Wales tiebreak. A few of our submissions have the same number of votes, so we're going to leave the competition up for **another 48 hours**. Now's your chance for your upvote to really make a difference! The votes will be counted again on **midnight 12th October**. Cheers everyone!

---

**Results**

Congratulations to /u/defiantchaos for [their submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wales/comments/1nntn9/contest_picture_of_the_month_september/ccowt25)!

Here at [Pusher](http://pusher.com/jobs) we are looking for Platform Engineers and Product managers. 

What is Pusher all about?

We focus on making developers' life easier. Our first product is a set of APIs that let you easily add realtime features to your applications or website. We have a lot of new products in the pipeline and are looking to build new teams around them. 

Pusher as been around for 3 years, we are VC backed but been profitable for the past 5 months now. We are currently a team of 10 based in Shoreditch, London (United Kingdom).

As you can see from our [job pages](http://pusher.com/jobs), we have a couple of open positions. The most interesting one (IMHO) are:

* Platform Engineers : The current Pusher platform is only the start of our plans. We're looking for engineers who can help us build out our platform and help shape the way software is produced.

* Engineer Managers: We're currently looking for someone to help us shape and evolve our technical team. This role will take some of the process and culture responsibilities that are currently shared by our CTO and CEO.

All of these jobs are based in London. 

Finally, our tech stack is Ruby, Haskell, Redis, Rails, Javascript &amp; mySQL.

If you are in London and interested in creating awesome products that improve developers' life, send us an email at jobs@pusher.com.

If you have any questions, PM me or shoot us and email :)

For the past few weeks imgur is very very very slow for me, and I am trying to work out why. I have a theory that imgur's uplink provider is throttling traffic to my ISP virginmedia.

If you don't mind, if you have a few moments, can you do a tracert to i.imgur.com. Even if you aren't using Virgin - I'd be interested to see the results.

To do a tracert if you're not sure - click on start, type cmd and press enter. In the window that appears type the following then press enter:

tracert i.imgur.com

This will output a list of the routers that packets are traversing before they land at imgur.

Traceroute is safe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute

Watch him play a lot, Jelle Vossen would be a great option as the two could play off each other. I know he's not a household name, but neither was Mirallas until we saw him get out there.

But he will probably be the half-human 10 that got sent to the alternate universe, since he's coming back with Rose.

Now, there was a deleted scene in which the full Doctor gives the half-human Doctor a ""Tardis Seed"", (which I think was just a chip of wood from the Tardis), which would eventually allow the human doctor to grow his own Tardis. Even if it's not cannon, it shows that they wanted to give 10 a way to come back to the main universe.

We also know that when the tenth doctor changed into the 11th, he was rather bitter about it.

And what a better way to drive home the point of humans being brash and irrational than by having the half-human doctor go mad with jealously for the real Doctor?

It wasn't planned for the Doctor to regenerate until the end of the 8th season, but with the timing of Matt's departure, I see a very good way that Moffat can kill off the 11th.

So, what I think may happen, is that the 10th doctor will essentially set up the demise of the 11th as a way for the 10th to come back to his universe.

But what if it was bigger than this? What if the explosion of the Tardis in the 5th season was due to Ten's meddling? It was stated in the 5th season in the Dreamlord episode, that the person which hates the Doctor the most is himself. Having 10 try to take revenge on 11 would be very fitting into this theme.

I see your reasoning behind this, his form has been poor and this was in plain sight yesterday against Bayern, but benching him for the next game may not be the best idea. It sends a message to Joe that the loss was his fault. When really it wasn't. The team as a whole were thoroughly out classed from the goal keeper all the way up to the forwards. What would it say to Joe if he saw players like Clichy, Ferna, and Dzeko starting in the next match. They were equally as poor, if not poorer than Joe. 

Joe isn't playing well, and he must improve there is no doubt, but benching him will not solve our problems. The defense needs to tighten up as well as the midfield. Joe is not the team. 

Now as for Edin, I've expressed my thoughts on him many times before and the Bayern game really proves my points. During the Bayern game he was invisible, we might as well have been playing with 10 men. Now in that situation, if I were him I would have dropped back a bit and helped the team defensively and regain possession. He did not do this, but even if he did it wouldn't have worked because he is simply not skilled enough to participate in fluid build up play from our half. Aguero has the skill and the technical prowess to do this, Dzeko on the other hand has one of the worst touches of a professional footballer I have ever seen, his passes are awkward and he lacks speed. His only saving grace is that he can finish, sometimes. Even in the Newcastle game which was his best performance so far this season he failed to score the chances that were given to him. Yes he was our top scorer last season but he wasn't our best striker. Tevez was miles better than he was in the way that he tracked back and helped the team, and when you're losing like we were yesterday that's what you need your strikers to do. 

But wait we need someone who can head the ball and contribute to build up play? 2 words: Alvaro Negredo. He is everything Edin Dzeko should be for our team, he is a better header of the ball, he's faster, stronger, has a much better touch and can pass. Just look at his pass to Navas against Wigan for the 5th goal. No-look, perfectly weighted, and right through the hole in the defense. I'm sure all of you saw his goal last night as well... 

Edin is a great player, he just does not fit in our system well and he is not good enough for us to build our play style around him.

Details:

* It was made for primary school children.

* I watched it around the year 2000 but it was probably made a few years before that, 1995 maybe?

* It featured two children, a brother and a sister. They wanted to learn more about what the poppy symbolises and they go back in time and see their grandfather, who was fighting in world war one.

* It was all British and historical and BBC-y.

* It was really exciting! Haha.

I come and go from this sub so sorry if this has been brought up sometime recently! I was recently rewatching The 11th Hour to de-stress after work (needed some comfort food!) and something caught me as weird about Amy's reaction to the inside of the Tardis. She's flipping around the controls, looking around all amazed and overhwhelmed, and then there's this shot. It's odd. It's filmed from higher up, looking down on her, but not in a way that suggests that she feels small, but in a way that suggests the camera is hiding something from you, the viewer. She looks up, and her face starts to go scared. And I don't mean overwhelmed, I mean there is something terrifying up there and she sees it. And then? She turns back to the Doctor, calm, collected, and sassy as ever and asks ""Why me?""

Did she see one of The Silents? We see later in The Lodger she does the same thing where she starts looking just behind the camera and yelling at it but then goes back to normal... Just like she does in The Impossible Astronaut.

Am I fan-theorizing too hard or does that seem like a cool little foreshadow disguised as something else?

My question is, is it ever explained how the TARDIS does this in the show? Can the TARDIS teleport or phase through walls? Why does it appear when landing and disappear when taking off if it's visible in flight (outside of it being easy to edit and looking cool)?

I help businesses with their online marketing. I have opportunities that come up fairly regularly, and I'm looking for someone to work with me on a pitch, make the call and help me win consulting gigs.

I have a workable sales plan and need someone to make a few calls a week only. It requires about 4-5hrs of someone's time a week.

Payment: I'm willing to pay 20% commission for each gig that is won, which means you could potentially earn £100 for a couple of hours of work.

Has to be someone that understand at least the basic concepts of online marketing. You don't have to be a technical whizz.

Looking for someone authentic, dependable, reliable and passionate. These traits are an absolute must and if the right person is found, this could turn into a long-term prosperous relationship.

Please PM me if interested.

Your laptop, iPad and iPhone all gone.

Police arrive but odds aren't good of you getting those things back. Hopefully you're insured.

Now imagine you have registered your things on [Immobilise.com](https://www.immobilise.com/index.php). You come home and find you've been burgled, you update Immobilise.com and show them as stolen. The crooks go to the local pawn shop who check the serial numbers against the Immobilise database and flag as stolen. The shop calls the police, property returned and hopefully one burglar in custody!

[Immobilise](https://www.immobilise.com/index.php) is FREE, you can register anything with a serial number or unique identifier and if your things get stolen it helps the police return them to you.

I can't emphasise how helpful it is for you to register with them and store the details of your things.

&gt;The Immobilise system was setup in 2003 and has had the support of the Police, mobile phone industry and central government since it's inception. With the support of these and numerous other organisations during the past 6 years the Immobilise service has grown to service over 25 million members in the UK alone.

I think that the biggest barrier to entry for some newer teams is how the only real prizes come from BYOC tournaments.

To use the upcoming i50 as an example - The price of a BYOC ticket is £92. The price of my travel would be ~£40 because I don't have a car, which also means I have to find some way of getting my PC (and equipment) to Telford without damaging it, this means I'd have to buy some sort of carry case. After that I have to book a hotel and by the time I've bought all that then unless my (hypothetical) team won first place then I'd make a huge loss on the whole weekend.

Now, if the same thing could be achieved without me having to bring my computer to the event the weekend would work out a lot cheaper and end up attracting a lot more players, even if the entry tickets were the same price.

Would it be entirely impossible for tournament organisers to partner with either a manufacturer or distributor of PC hardware and set up a LAN where all the computers are provided?

http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/VIDEO-St-Gallen-fans-good-voice-Swansea-City-game/story-19883258-detail/story.html#ixzz2glWUlDDj

The misinformation was that I reported stories I had heard in the stadium that were going around, that St. Gallen fans had smashed up several pubs in the city centre. This was not the case, and it's clear that their organised, peaceful and traditional march to the stadium has somehow been misconstrued on arrival at the stadium due to the police escort with them (which I'd imagine is standard safety protocol and a condition of the march). The addition of pubs can only be the result of Chinese whispers.

I just felt I had a responsibility to correct some bullshit I'd help spread, and I feel that if it was *our* fanbase and people thought we'd behaved like that when we hadn't, I'd be quite disappointed.

We touched on hiring a bunk barn which everyone was very keen on.


The problem is that most of us are djs and we would want to have an all night party. We are a respectful bunch who don't take the piss. We wouldn't be bringing a full rig, just a small pa system so the noise would be limited. 


What I'm asking is does anybody know of any bunk barns where the owners aren't too close or next door or do you know of any where the owners are fairly sound about things like this?

Those without an IRC client can access it in browser [here](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23plymouthmeetup&amp;uio=d4)

Looking to set up a meet-up before Christmas.  Group is to discuss tech/code/projects/geek culture and pretty much anything.  Once we get a core unit we could even bounce projects between eachother.  If you just want to come by and chat feel free to!

I'll be about most times, if I am not leave a message and my logs will pick it up.  Even if we get a handful of people involved, it is a start.  Drop by whenever you have time :)

I thought the idea was so original, poetic, and fantastic, and the execution equally awe-inspiring. The theme was so quintessentially Doctor Who as well: the idea that The Doctor would sacrifice the thing that means the most to him (traveling the universe) to save **one** person from certain death. Like most other exceptional science fiction shows (looking at you, TNG) Doctor Who strikes a beautiful balance between sci-fi and human interest: a juxtaposition of technology and moral compassion. A realization and acceptance of the adage ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  A throwing down of the gauntlet at the feet of humanity, as it moves into a new era of technology. So I'm wondering: which episode had that effect on you, fellow Whovians? That moment of just being wowed by what an excellent series this is...

The tailor has offered to sort something out but I haven't asked anything of him yet, it is sort of time sensitive though since I want to debut the outfit in early November.

One problem is I live in a really rough area, and I'm only 18. I was quoted £8-£6K from most insurance companies and sometimes they cannot quote me. I can't even get a quote from insurance companies designed for young people using a blackbox.

I can easily afford £3k insurance but they're not quoting me that, so any tips?

I can't get someone older on my insurance as a second driver.

It's cheaper to rent a cheap one bedroomed house 5 minutes away in a completely different postcode then insure the car based on that address. I don't know if it's legal. Even if it was illegal, how could they prove it?

I could also insure my car using my family member address which is also nearby.

There's a shop near me that has 24/7 parking that is rarely full, I could park car at there and get cheaper premium.

Btw, I'm disabled, is there any companies specialising in disability car insurance? It seems to me that most disability car insurance companies are all about allowing you to modify car, but I don't need to do that. I haven't asked for a quote from them yet, but is it cheaper?

Which cars are cheapest to insure?

**EDIT 1: Brought the quote down to £4k with an excess of £750. I used third party and theft, 1 year NCB, 1 year license holder, age at 19 and dynamic panda as a car.**

Apparently, that £4k quote can be brought down to £3.5k with £250 excess if I put in as no NCB instead of 1 year NCB wtf. 

Got the quote down to around £3K, I'm wondering if it's can be reduced again. £1K costs in petrol and maintenance should be enough?

**EDIT 2: Brought insurance down to £2500 if I use Ford Ka car. Tempting but I still need a 5 door car that can match the cost to insure Ford Ka car :/ Also, I have to wait for a year so I can say I've been a holder of the license for a year.**",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Any tips reducing car insurance premium?

What's going on with us falling asleep for the second half recently? Fulham, Newcastle and now City today.

Also, although it looks like we have a lot of depth up front with Lukaku, Kone and Jelavic - is the quality good enough for when we don't have Lukaku available? Kone came on for ten minutes and looked a waste of space.

Unbeaten run is finally over but we should bounce back against Hull after the international break and I fancy us against a weak Aston Villa side.

And while I'm here for a month (2 weeks left) I have only had one day off and will probably only get one more, before I go home.

There is so much I want to see, but without a car, it seems impossible.  I took the train into London on my last day off, and tried to cram as much as I could in, but I barely scratched the surface.  And I'm really upset that the Churchill War Rooms were closed for the day.  As I'm a huge WW2 buff, and this country is like the Disneyland of history for me.

I pretty much have to decide between going to some of the local sites or going back in to London for a day and seeing a couple of the bigger things.

Realistic sites while I'm here include:

**Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial** (Think I can take a taxi there for a somewhat reasonable amount)

**Imperial War Museum Duxford** (There is a bus that goes there, but only on Sundays, which might not work.)

**Churchill War Rooms** I don't care if I have to drag my luggage through it on my way to the airport.  I'm not leaving without going.

**University of Cambridge** There is a lot of history all around me.  Sadly, I work 10-12 hours a day, so most things are closed by the time I finish.  Renting a bike, which helps.

**British Museum** It's not the highest on my list, after seeing so much already.  But everyone insists it should be, so if I go to London again, I'll make sure to go.

When I was in London for the day I was able to see:

Museum of Science

Museum of Natural History

Buckingham Palace

St James Park

Big Ben 

Houses of Parliament

Westminster Abbey

Piccadilly Circus

And some other smaller sights.  But I was exhausted by the end of it and couldn't wait to get back to my flat and sleep, as I had another week of chaos at work ahead of me.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Best way for an American to see the country in one day?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1nsai1/best_way_for_an_american_to_see_the_country_in/

Sitting in the TARDIS, alone, the Doctor gets up and strokes the TARDIS's console. ""Where should I go next old pal"" said the Doctor.
A slight hum is heard.
""1927. Nah. Boring year. Try something different.""
Another , slightly more high pitched hum comes from the TARDIS.
""300,204. Perfect. The 52nd anti-grav olympics, Queen 
Elizabeth the 47th crowned. Yes I think i'll go there.""
With a few pulls of levers, pushes of buttons and turns of knobs the TARDIS starts to move. A strange noise comes out of the TARDIS and then and explosion.
""NO,NO,NO. What are you doing. Why are you pulling me away. Seriously stop.""
The TARDIS lands.
""1535. Why the hell have you brought me here.""
The doctor walks down the steps, grabs his long brown coat and heads out the door. He is confronted with three large men, all with guns. 
""Hello..."" The Doctor says

Its full of spelling/grammar errors, but I hope its not too unreadable....

I do not like the Cybusmen, really really do not like them. Classic series (especially the Invasion and post-Earthshock) just look so much better. They are powerful and emotionless, and unstoppable. Cybusmen are screaming all the time, kept in check with an emotion chip. In the Invasion, the cybermen are infected with them....

Anyway, slight rant over. Hope you enjoy

Replaced and Upgraded

Space is not a vacuum. Tiny particles, dust storms and asteroids; the embryos of future stars and planets drift purposelessly in the void. Occasionally, perhaps every hundred million year or so, a large enough mass attracts them and they begin to form something new. As the gravitational forces pull more objects together, the force increases exponentially. This relentless process of creation can fail; the core of the new world collapses in on it self. It breaks apart, sending its components spinning off into the dark, insignificant and forgotten. 

One of these pieces of aborted worlds was drifting at the edge of the solar system. Sol’s faint light illuminated the rock barely more than the billions of other stars in the galaxy, dozens, if not hundreds of light years away. Hugging to the rock like a limpet was a ship. Its design seemed wrong in some way; unsophisticated and crude. It seemed unlikely that something that could develop space flight would be able to design something like this. The main section was not in any way aerodynamic, yet the carbon marks showed signs of atmospheric flight. It seemed to only have one set of engines, with barely any capacity for manoeuvre. Whilst it looked armed to the teeth, it had a critical lack of armour. 

But inside differed significantly. The bright corridors and plasma screened viewing monitors suggested a worship of cutting edge technology. Touch screen buttons, automatic doors and wireless networking. Sleek and stylish controls to pilot a flawed, primitive ship. The crew would not have appreciated the irony.

The CyberLord sat on the battle bridge. The various control and monitoring sub-systems uploaded the constantly updating readings for the ship, noting any slight variation in temperature or angular momentum of the rock they clung to. At present the information had no strategic value, but it may have future use. The struggle to get off earth had been harder than anticipated. When the primary force had ceased reporting in 1851, the reserve combat elite unit had been activated. After a hundred years of waiting in the tunnels of London, they had been able to steal enough technology to assemble this ship. Even then, they had almost been shot down by Britain’s prototype missile defence system. Now they sat, with inhuman patience amongst the stars, for the 2007 invasion. Battle computer predicted a 78% probability of success if the Cybusmen were forewarned of their original failures. They could change the past and ensure Cybus victory. For now, the majority of the crew were suspended, to prolong their life spans and ensure peak efficiency when they returned to Earth. Only the Cyberlord remained awake, in case of emergencies. 

All at once an alarm began to wail. A deep metallic voiced boomed throughout the ship. “Warning. Ship detected. Approaching from outside the solar system. Warning. Ship Detected,’ it repeated. Within 20 microseconds of detection, the entire crew had been reawakened. Within 30, the situation had been downloaded to their minds and roles had been assigned to each of them. In a little over a second, each had armed itself and had left its alcove, heading to its position. In the bridge, the CyberLord examined the data on the unexpected arrival. The new ship was smaller than theirs, but was much more sophisticated. It was chrome and seemed to shine, despite eternal darkness. The engines were sleek, with 4 sets of additional boosters, allowing it to outmanoeuvre its opponents. It sent a shudder of doubt through the CyberLord’s cold, logical brain. 

The ships computer was calculating the odds of engaging this enemy. So many unknowns left it useless. The CyberLord merely waited for it to suggest a strategy; there was no reaction to facing a totally unknown enemy. The most optimum strategy was to wait and observe the newcomer and see how it reacted. The other ship was moving fast, it would be entering active scanning range in seconds. So far, it had not reacted to the other ship; it would appear not to have noticed the Cybusmen. 

From the helm, a crew member reported that active scans had reached the other ship, but no additional data had been received. Whatever it was, it could block their scans. The CyberLord could detect the battle computers additional processing of this data as it attempted to relate this new data into its plans.

Suddenly, the other ship change direction, instantly darting like a silver fish caught on a line. 

&gt;&gt; What is happening? Report!

The telemetric operator responded:

&gt;&gt; The other ship has changed vector. It is headed on a direct course with our current position. 

The CyberLord was instantly given the new strategy: to leave the asteroid and attempt to directly attack the enemy vessel. It must have superior scanners, weapons and engines, but perhaps the crew would be susceptible to Cybus weapons. If they could board the ship, they may have a chance and access to a superior vessel. 

With a wheezing of the photonic cells and spluttering of engines improvised from old cars, the Cybus ship slowly lifted from the surface of the planet, ready to engage this new enemy. With the battle computer highlighting the use of intimidation, the Cyberlord open radio channel to the (newly designated) enemy chip. 

&gt;&gt; This is Cybus flagship, Alpha-1. You will shut down your ships engines and prepare to be boarded. If you do not surrender, you will be deleted. 

The only response was background radiation and an electron hissing sound. The Lord’s internal countdown was set at 10  seconds; when it reached zero, all weapons would fire and a dozen high explosive missiles would pierce the space between them. As soon as the counter reached 0.5, the enemy ships weaponry hit, shaking Alpha-1. 
The sirens began again. It seemed to be some form of electro –magnetic pulse combined with a high energy laser. Shields were completely lost, engines were already non-functional and half the weapons systems were non-responsive.

 The strategy was re-analysed, reassessed and put into action. The remaining missiles whirled and span in alternating arcs to where the enemy ship sat. The missiles would take at least thirty seconds to cover the distance but the CyberLord predicted the enemy would be unable to shoot them down or engage its engines fast enough to escape the missiles blast. The enemy continued sitting there, as the missiles got closer and closer. 20 seconds, 15, 10, 5....

With a blur, the ship disappeared. The missiles detonated harmlessly, tiny pinpricks of light against the star filled backdrop, as they quickly used up their oxygen. On the bridge, the CyberLord could feel an emotion building, as the inhibitor in its chest failed to deal with the increased stimulus. It wondered where the enemy had gone. The answer was immediately given, when another blast hit them from behind. 

The lights instantly burnt out. The primary system shut down, and for a second whilst the back ups rebooted, the Cybusmen were each alone. No inhibitors, no computer network keeping them linked together. They screamed, as their brains burned in their cases, a horrifying sound from computer hell.  

With the emergency systems back on, they began to return to normal operating procedures. But now there was nothing they could do. Disorientated, the CyberLord received a report from the airlock. They were being boarded. There was still a chance for them to achieve victory. If they could overcome the crew, the enemy ship would be theirs. 

The rest of the crew were ordered to the main airlock. They silently marched through the narrow cooridors, arm lasers deployed and the handful of anti-polycarbide guns presented to those at the front. Whilst it matched no known design, the enemy ship could be a Skarosian vessel. The Cybusmen stood waiting impatiently for whatever would come through. Twenty eight deadly cyborgs, the conquers of alternate London, unstoppable threat from another world, waited for their enemy to appear.

From behind the air lock, a series of a bangs and clanks could be detected. Something heavy was moving. A series of electronic noises began to fill the air – an override signal, breaking through their fire walls and safeguards. With a hiss, the airlock door opened. 

&gt;&gt;DELETE

The CyberLord called out, receiving a stream of video and sensor data from the Cybusmen at the front of the crowd. Metal arms raised, a violent wave of red lasers filled the airlock. The air filled with the zapp of lasers and buzz of guns. A bright flash of light radiated from the airlock doorway. The signals from the first 4 cybusmen instantly ceased; their cameras burnt out and sensors overloaded. The life support systems failed and they moaned as their brains boiled. A second burst and next 4 had ceased to function. More Cybusmen moved forward to replace their fallen comrades, still firing into the doorway. A single jet of flame hit one in the chest. It screamed as the white contents of its chest spilled across the floor. Another 8 jets of flame and the crew were already more than half destroyed. Consulting the battle computer, the Cyberlord called for a retreat. It was becoming increasingly difficult to issue order, with the emotional confusion of seeing it’s crew easily decimated. 

Still firing, the reaming twelve Cybusmen tried to escape back to the bridge. The intruders stepped through the airlock, ducking their heads through the doorways designed for steel giants. They continued to fire on the Cybusmen, as they clumsily marched away. 

By the time they had reached and sealed the bridge, only CyberLord and three others survived. With the battle computer unable to find any possible strategy to gain victory, the CyberLord intended to fight until it could no longer function. A fist clanged against the bridge door; the intruders had arrived. They were breaking the door with their bare fists. It crumpled like paper with just a few blows. They stepped through the door and gazed around the room, the four of them analysing the bridge and the remnants of the crew. 

They were at least 7 foot tall, with a blank soulless metal face. Their head’s almost perfect square s with handles attached on either side of their head, meeting in the middle, by a glowing white light. Their silver armour reflected the emergency lighting of the computer panels. A chunky box on each chest wired and glowed. Their arms and legs had hydraulic piping running along the sides, increasing their strength and stamina. 2 of them carried stumpy weapons, with a flawed opening and sub-machine gun style stock. The fourth had black handles on its head, marking it as a leader in the same way the Cybusmen did. 

The first Cybusman reached one of the intruders and attempted to wrestle its head off. The intruder knocked it aside and began attacking its chest, ripping the wiring out. The Cybusmen could put up no fight as it’s life was quickly ended. The remaining two Cybusmen fired their laser weapons, but they bolts harmlessly hit the intruders and dissipated. The two with guns raised them; with a burst of flame, the Cybusmen fell, moaning as their control circuits melted and their synthetic nervous system melted. Now only the CyberLord remained. The emotional inhibitor was failing but attempted to keep it stable.

&gt;&gt;Identify yourselves.

The Intruders remained silent. The CyberLord tried one final time. 

&gt;&gt; We are Cybusmen, from an alternative Earth. Identify yourselves.

The black clad Intruder stepped forward, its enormous hand reaching out to encompass the entirety of the CyberLord’s head. It’s electronic voice was sinister and inhuman; this was something created for its practicality, not its consumer appeal. As it applied the strength of ten men to the CyberLord's transparent brain case, it spoke: 

&gt;&gt; WE. ARE. THE. MONDASIAN. CYBERMEN. 

With this, the CyberLords brain case shattered, the organic contents instantly crushed between the CyberLeaders augmented fingers. 

The potential threat was alleviated. The Cybermen left the bridge, returning to their ship and resuming their mission after this momentary interruption.

Today, he and QPR won 2-0 against Burnley. He played a DMC position, presumably playmaking as he had 130 touches of the ball, 17 more than any other player (Barton, who played the pivot with him). Out of these touches, he had 115 passes (2 key passes) at a 90% completion rate - also having 1 shot on the offense. 

I find his defensive stats most interesting, because it is what he is most criticised for. Over the course of the game, he had 5 tackles, the highest of the game, and also 2 interceptions. 

Carroll achieved a rating of 7.7 in this match (WhoScored, because who doesn't use that site?), while also achieving a high score of 7.5 for the season. Also very interesting, 'Arry has played him across 4 different positions this season, DMC, MC, AML and AMC. 

What do people think of him this season that have seen him play? Is he progressing well?
