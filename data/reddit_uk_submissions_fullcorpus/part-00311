My grandfather died today of complications from pneumonia. He was 93. He was a very tough man. He was a drifter at 15 and he joined the US Army at 18. 

During the war, he stormed the beach at Omaha and then went on to fight his way through France and the Netherlands. He didn't mind talking about the war, but all of us kids will always remember how deeply and respectfully he always talked about the British armoured divisions. According to him (and perhaps the historians among you can help us out) the Brits came to his unit's rescue in Normandy when they were pinned down in northern France. He used to tell the story of how he once got into a ""friendly brawl"" with a Scots infantryman after they had had too much liquor. 

He always kept a picture of Churchill on his wall, and was proud of the fact that he answered the call after hearing the ""finest hour"" speech. I know he would love to know that his great respect was passed on, even in this small way, to a country he greatly admired. 

Much love from the States. 

edit: Wow. Thank you all so much for the outpouring of affection. Going to try and respond to each comment individually. Yes, he was a great man, and there are so few of that generation left.

After a panic-stricken start, all I was hoping to read was a post with a positive outlook. 

Let's start with the first game - we started with the best lineup and played really well right till the 52nd min when we got the red card. 

Oscar looked good and performed well as he had mentioned earlier that he wanted to compete with Eden for the Best player title. 

Given that we were a 10 man army, I think Begovic gave a good maiden performance,  I think we almost didn't miss Cech. 

All Mourinho asks of his team is that we beat last year's performance.  I think this is a good wake up call and it's probably better to a make these mistakes in the beginning when there are a lot more chances to cover up. 

Going forward, I trust that Jose will find a way to lift the team's morale and we will see Chelsea play on a different level. Lets not forget that we are the CHAMPIONS for 2015 and no one can take that away from us. I think we can safely assume that this year will be a repeat of the 2004-05 performance by Mourinho and we'll take the title two years in a row!!

I would love to hear our fans cheer their hearts out for the next game and increase the intensity of the game;  we need to remind them of the champions they are. Let's do our part and I'm sure the SPECIAL ONE, Mourinho will do his.


IN MOURINHO I TRUST.

We are first time buyers and about to choose a mortgage. We've decided to go with a fixed rate but we have an option of 2, 3 or 5 years. 

The payments are:

2 year - £1110
3 year - £1185
5 year - £1314

Obviously, it's a bit of a 'look into your crystal ball' question but we all know that interest rates are only going to go one way, right? It's just a question of how quickly.

We can afford to overpay and the mortgage allows us to do so by 10% per year we will be looking to do so whichever one we will choose. We won't be looking to move in the next 5 years if that helps any. Our combined income is ~£4,500

I've noticed more reports linking Yannick with Tottenham this week, and it looks as though he would be open to a move. If he does leave, our asking price is reported to be £25m, but I imagine we will get something around the £18m mark. 

Would you all be happy with that?

Personally, I'd be very dissapointed to see him leave. He might not have the best end product in the league, but he is an excellent player to watch and he improved a lot last season. Saying that, Tottenham are a huge club and it would be a great move for him, he would easily get in the team ahead of Townsend.

Who would you like us to sign as a replacement?

I'm aware that we recently signed Sakho, but with £18m or so knocking around we could bring another winger in.

**MATCH OFFICIAL**

**Referee**: [Fred Graham] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Graham_(referee\))

***


**FORM**      
          
Pompey have won all three matches so far in League and Cup, including an impressive win over Championship team Derby.

 The 'Reds' are still looking for their first win of the season after a draw and two defeats. They lost to L1 team Peterborough in the cup and then against [AFC Wimbledon](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33831955) last weekend, so their losses aren't to bad teams.

***

**MANAGER'S COMMENTS**

**Paul Cook**: ""We're not getting carried away. It's a good start but we're keeping our feet on the ground and looking forward to another tough game on Tuesday.""

**Mark Yates**: (their manager) ""It's as tough as they get in this division. They have a big squad and have started the season very well, which is not surprising. No one will fancy us but if we produce a 90 minute performance I think we can give anyone a good game.""

 Last seen in 2012-13, we beat Crawley [3-0] (http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19454700) in our first meeting at their ground, when they managed to go down to 9 after having two men sent off, but they took revenge at Fratton on Boxing Day with a [2-1] (http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/20778961) win.

My only problem is that I just have the mobile phone of his brother (I have signed the contract 2 years ago with the brother). They provided me an address and an email two years ago but now they are probably all changed (they have never answered to my emails communications). I have their bank account coordinates but that's it.

This person barely answers my phone calls and I do not feel very comfortable to give notice just through a text. Is there any way I can oblige him to give me a real address and having everything written down through formal communications? I do not trust them so much (they are very lazy and disorganized) and they always refuse to write things down.

&gt; 
&gt; As stated previously, Lucas and LFC will part way. Sakho will remain. LFC looking for a club to loan Markovic till January.
&gt; 
&gt; There's more to the Sakho situation than meets the eye. He will remain this summer, but all is not well with him and BR.
&gt; 
&gt; His wife had a baby last week, but every training session since, he has been partnered with Toure in the 'B' side, not once with Skrt/Lov.
&gt; 
&gt; He remains for now, but long-term, with Rodgers the manager, there's only one way this will end.
&gt; 
&gt; Put it simply, he's delighted to be an LFC player. But increasingly disillusioned by being a 'Rodgers player'.
&gt; 
&gt; These aren't views based on team selection. Basic facts of what is going on behind the scenes. Pinch of salt if you want, but it's true.
&gt; 
&gt; Rodgers prefers Lovren. Sakho feels he has done nothing to be sidelined and has told BR. Rodgers not happy with his attitude.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite trying to shed some light on the situation, as we said, Sakho will remain an LFC player this summer. How long for is another matter.
&gt; 
&gt; Enrique, Balotelli, Borini, Lucas, Moreno, Sakho and Markovic all feel hard done by. The last four, rightly so
&gt; 
&gt; Fully expecting LFC to brief the press and/or Rodgers stating Sakho has picked up a knock. Not true, if/when it does happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Reliably know he (BR) will be gone either way if he fails to deliver CL football next year, no two ways about it.

check it yourself.

if this is true, then this maybe the downfall of rodgers (by playing favorites). thats not a good man management at all, to sideline the players u don't want or like. sakho has proven again and again that he is the most reliable defender we have in this club, and he treat him like this. hope all of this is bullshit tho, i would be really sad to see him go...",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Sakho situation explained by @LFCGlobe.,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/3hf871/sakho_situation_explained_by_lfcglobe/

Is it slang?  Is it basically a part of thuggish and/or chav-ish vocabulary?

* The first use of ""the governor"" in the film

Without spoiling, here is the context in which it is used, with background: 

The protagonist (a university-aged kid whom I would call ""chav""-ish) has a step-father, who is an abusive, violent thug.

**He is referred to as ""the governer/guv'nah"" of the group of chav-ish-cronies/thugs/lackeys/members/followers/etc.,** and the group needs his permission if they want to bully the protagonist since he's married to the kid's mother.  **Makes me assume that ""guv'nah"" means ""leader of a street gang.""**

When the group, minus ""the governor,"" wants to bully the kid the group says ""what, you think we can't touch you just because your mum is married to our **guv'nah**?"" and the protagonist says, ""mmmyeah...pretty much.""    

**So, what does ""governor"" mean here?**  

Is it like the **leader of a *street-level* gang** (maybe some low-level drug dealing and sports-betting/bookie activities), as opposed to the leader of a mafia, which is a much larger operation and organization, has all sorts of *strict* rules, has a set structure and hierarchy, and has an *institutional level* influence (like ""owning"" some police/judges/lawmakers/et al.) -- basically, **the leader of a street-level gang and *not* a Don of a mafia.**

* The last use of ""the governor"" in the film

Here's the other part of the confusion.

At least with respect to the context of the film:  when the protagonist is given a favor by someone else, a middle-aged gentleman, he says, **""thank you, you're the guv'nah.""**  It was used like ""you're the man.""

So, is it more of a generalized slang term for ""the boss"" or ""the man"", rather than ""leader of a street level gang""?

This is why I'm confused -- the two contextual situations give the term really different meanings.

**TL;DR -- What does ""governor"" -- or, ""guv'nah"" -- mean in the UK?  *Kingsman* uses it twice but they made it more confusing for me: one was used to describe a street gang leader, the other was used as a thanking compliment to a gentleman in the ""you're the man"" way.**

**EDIT: Thanks for the responses.  It's odd.  I keep seeing that it's rarely used, and it's evident by the wide range of definitions provided.  Yet, the film is British and was written, directed, and acted by British people (Sam L Jackson is the only American) -- so it wasn't like an American who wrote the script thinking that ""that's the way British people talk!"", even though it appears that way.**

Just under 2 years ago (Nov 2013) my wife and I bought a flat for £140k, At the time we got a 4.99% apr on 90% LTV, 5 year fix, We only had 5% deposit and our mortgage advisor told us there were no 95% LTV mortgages available to us, and to get a personal loan to pay the rest of the deposit, we borrowed enough for the deposit, plus a bit extra for improvements. In the end we got a £14k personal loan (4.2% apr), set to be fully paid off at the end of our 5 year fixed rate, on top of the £126k mortgage meaning we borrowed about £140k in the end.

After 2 years we have about £12k left on the loan and about £120k left on the mortgage. but it is costing us about £720 in mortgage (which we are overpaying to 750pcm) and £330 in loan payments monthly, so £1080 in all. I take home about £1200 pcm and any wife takes £1100 so 1050pcm is quite a large chunk of our salary, and my wife is pregnant and will be going on maternity soon so we'll be having a cut to our income, and we're already struggling to make ends meet.

I have had a look at house prices and more than one site has estimated that our flat should now be worth around £165k now, and our ERC on our mortgage is 3%.

This means to get out of our mortgage now we would need to pay about 3600 on top of the 120k, plus the 12k on our loan and a bit extra for fees means if I was to remortgage now we would be able to consolidate our loans and get an 85% LTV mortgage, at about 3% fixed for a few years and only pay about £700 pcm in total, maybe for a 3 or 4 year fix.

So my question is this, if you were in my position, would you stick out the 5 year fix, and personal loan and remortgage at the end, at which point we'll be in a much better position for remortgaging, OR leave our current mortgage now, pay the ERC, consolidate our loans, and be paying less for the next 3 years, but probably end up having paid a bit more over the total length of the mortgage? Have any of you been in a similar position?

I have tried talking to my wife about it but this kind of stuff goes over her head and she has ""baby brain"" anyway, she has basically told me to find out as much as I can and make the decision myself.

So I wanted a one month membership at a 24hour gym while I was working in the summer, so I could workout in the night. I already have a membership at a gym that I love, but which unfortunately isn't 24hours.

So for this one month, I paid the membership fee and joined and ended up using the gym just twice as I was usually exhausted after working all day. So before even a month is up, I try and cancel. I look on their [website](http://www.thegymgroup.com/) and they instruct you to just call up the bank and cancel the direct debit and then your membership will automatically be cancelled.

So I phoned up the bank to cancel, and they quickly put it through, and also sent me a letter saying that the direct debit is cancelled. Fast forward two months, to today and I'm looking through my statements when I see that they've taken two further payments of £12.99 each since I cancelled. 

Now that doesn't seem like much, but to a student living in an expensive area, I have to penny pinch like mad.

This is when they story get's crazy. So I phone up Barclays to cancel my direct debit (again) and they say, that the direct debit was cancelled the first time, but The Gym Group set up a new one without my authorisation to take the further two payments. So belatedly I think okay, I don't have to money to fight these guys in the courts to recoup my £25.98, so instead I'll just cancel the direct debit again, and block they're account from setting up another. 

Literally in the minute it took the lady on the phone to cancel the direct debit, and then block the account from setting up further direct debits, they had set up another. Crazy.

This is clearly a malicious system designed to charge customers looking to cancel. I can't believe that they get away with this, to me it seems like highway robbery, and I'm wondering how on Earth it can be legal?

They have no contact number, no staff at the gym to talk to that I can find. It's such a frustrating and stressful situation. I hope they don't take more money from me as I literally cannot afford it.

Last month after lurking for a very long time, I decided to sign up and talk skin with you guys. 

Thanks to firefox7275 for stepping in and talking to me straight. So here's my update. It's not a great one, but it's a start. Picture is definitely worse than last month. 

The main thing I did was go to my doctor. I took my arsenal of photos and skin/food diary and calmly explained what I wanted. Some tears happened, but I managed to get trough it. 

My doctor understood that I've got a big life event coming up soon, that will include photos of me. It's in about a month and we discussed me going to America and why starting something topical could be problematic. She's prescribed me oxytetracycline to start the infection clear up. I've also been prescribed both skinoren and acnecide to patch test. 

So my routine now looks like this: 
Am: shower + eucerin putrefying face wash (fully patch tested 1 month) 
       4x 250g oxytetracycline 
        Oilatum natural repair face cream forehead and nose and c section (fully patch tested) 
Eucerin 5% day cream cheeks and neck (patch tested) 
Eucerin 50+ sun fluid 

Evening 
OCM with my original mix 75ml bottle. 3ml tea tree + 3ml Rosemary + 48ml cold pressed safflower oil + 12ml calendula oil. I changed to 30/70 castor safflower hoping to get 'grits' but I'm pretty sure it made me breakout because I couldn't remove all the castor oil of once I stopped double cleansing. 

Then eucerin face wash again 
Followed by small patch test of acnecide (leave for at least 30 mins) before moisturiser applied 
Same as above. 

Although I have bought sample sizes of PC clear extra strength SA 2% exfoliant I've not began patch testing because of Acnecide, but I have bought a kodjac sponge from super drug and added that to my routine every other evening. 

Okay. So this month my acne went full c section. I had only changed my double cleanse to a single and I fully believe it was as Firefox said - castor oil is hard to remove without ruining your acid mantle. Changing back to my previous oil mix and measuring with syringes has not lead to persistent breakouts. 

The major breakout I experienced is now calming down probably because of the antibiotics, but as least it gives me time to patch test before applying full face. Otherwise I won't know what's helping or not.

I've also adopted a un loved fit bit and can now say I'm doing 14,000 steps daily without trying. 
Diet: apart from eating my usual high protein, complex carb and diverse fruit and veg meals I've got the doctor to put me in line for for allergy testing. I'm pretty sure lactose plays havoc with my skin and as my antibiotics don't allow diary I've cut it from my meals and drinking.

West Brom are in discussions with Tottenham about signing centre-back Federico Fazio, according to Sky sources.

It is understood Spurs are interested in signing West Brom's England U21 international striker Saido Berahino and talks over Fazio are taking place in the first phase of negotiations.

First phase of negotiations makes me think they will sell us Berahino once they wrap up the Fazio deal.

I think we can field a really strong, young team in Europe, that we will enjoy watching, and I expect some of those players to take the 'Harry Kane route' and get into our regular starting XI through good European performances. Trippier, Ali and Pritchard are definitely capable of doing so.

Formation: 3-4-2-1

__________ Benteke _________

______ Coutinho _ Lallana ______


_______ Can ____ Milner _______

Moreno __________________ Clyne

___ Gomez __ Lovren __ Skrtel ___

__________ Mignolet _________


Here's why;

**The Formation:** This fixture is a tough one, Arsenal like to play the ball along their opposition's defensive line looking for a gap to exploit, the more men we have in this line, the more difficult it is likely to be. Rodgers has had success with this formation in the past and I feel this is an ideal time for us to bring it back, it will also give us a chance to see Gomez in a more central position.

**Moreno in for Ibe:** If the last 10 minutes of yesterday's game are anything to go off, it appears benching this young Gerrard/Alonso love child has motivated him to play as best he can. I feel his defensive awareness is the key factor in my decision though as we look to tighten up, with Ibe's focus on attack. To be fair Ibe could have kept his place instead of Lallana who has been pretty quiet so far this season, however with Lallana's experience and technical ability he gets the nod from me.

**Can in for Henderson:** Henderson appears to have a muscular injury and may not recover in time, and Can's performances have been very impressive (albeit from substitute appearances), particularly his tackling. This will also give Milner slightly more freedom to get involved in the attacks.

Of course this is just my opinion though. Do you agree? How do you think we should line up?

Now, it might not be what you think. I love the trains. They are on time more than you think. They are pretty quick. They are clean, there's even a man that comes with a trolley to sell you booze.

I love sitting in a train window and watching the world go by (my favourite thing is spotting a cricket or football game as we pass by, my super favourite thing is seeing a goal or a wicket happen!). Britain is beautiful, and watching it from a train is great. I love sitting in the train, with a can of booze and a chocolate biccie, reading a book or the paper, and knowing that it's much more enjoyable than driving along a motorway.

I don't even mind it when they're busy, and I don't mind chatting to people.

So, I love the trains (sorry).

What's annoying is the cost!

This weekend I've got to go to (near) Telford* from London. The price for an ***off-peak* advance return**, booked in advance for two of us is £178, for a 2.5hr journey each way. It's bloody expensive! It's annoying because I'd love to get the train, but I've managed to rent a Ford Focus (ie not a bad car) for £39 for 4 days. I'd much rather get the train than drive, but even for two of us it costs £140 more to get the public transport! 

Very frustrating.

Phrases like ""Anfield rocking"" and the the famous kop are regularly embedded into twitter arguments as we deride the so called ""plastics"" of some of the teams who have seen their fan base grow as a result of recent success.  Raheem sterling is regularly notified on twitter that he has swapped the ""cauldron of passion"" for the ""emptihad"". 
This is all well and good if we can actually deliver this deafening noise and atmosphere through thick and thin. The reality is, however, for those at recent Anfield games (this season and last) will have noticed that a deathly silence descends on the ground about 15 minutes in. Yes, YNWA is always impeccably blasted out but then as those in the ground take their seats very little singing is heard unless the team scores. 
I understand that atmosphere is driven by performance and that frustration can kick in (especially against lower quality teams) however if we take a look at Crystal Palace (painful I know) their fans have earned themselves plenty of plaudits for their rousing support that drives the team on. If their fans can cause that much noise despite their team's obviously lower standard of performances then we  really have no excuse.
 Anybody who attended Anfield the last two seasons will testify that people appear too self conscious to sing. If you attempt to start a chant you receive a series of judgmental faces from the row ahead. Too often ""where's your famous atmosphere?"" is painfully heard from the away section (Eg Bournemouth last night). Even those watching on tv can testify to morgue decibel levels at some points during the game.

A lot of the locals will tell you it's all the tourists and point towards the astonishing number of people who start clapping midway through YNWA. However, I feel that it is in fact these locals with a special weekly seat who appear to glare at the sole chanters and become easily frustrated, aiming disgusted hand gestures and colourful language at every misplaced pass. I believe that it's actually some of these 'tourists' who (on one of there only chances to visit Anfield this season) attempt to sing their heart out only to be met with disapproving tuts from old men who then return home and nostalgically reminisce about the famous kop in the 80s.
 
I am looking for the community here to offer some ideas on how to improve the atmosphere which some of those who attend regularly can then implement on matchdays. Maybe passionate singers can attempt to coordinate together to get nearby seats on the kop to begin the chanting. What I've found is that when somebody stats a chant and maybe five or ten people pick it up it quickly resonates along the whole stadium. This is much more successful with the more well known songs Eg ""when the reds go marching in"" and ""we are liverpool tra la la la.""

I feel if we are to conserve our renowned atmosphere and infamous Kop we need to act now before Anfield becomes just another premier league ground. In a time when the prospects of success on the pitch appear slim what is there to define us and set us apart from those midtable teams (that our rival fans desperately want to group us with) if isn't our unrivalled support for the team through thick and thin.

That's fine, it's just the make-up of the people subscribing. But what bothers me is that views that disagree with the left wing majority get downvoted so heavily. This isn't a matter of just ""imaginary internet points"", it means that if you try to sustain a back and forth, you get restricted from posting. It really isn't conducive to open debate.

It's also not true that the posts getting downvoted are because they're rude, or incoherent, or something else. I've seen perfectly calmly argued right-of-centre points get hidden from downvote, and I've seen points as unhelpful and obnoxious as ""Gove is just a cunt"" get lots of upvotes. 

There was a brief respite in this behaviour for about a week after the election, where there was a genuinely good forum for back and forth between left-leaning and right-leaning posters. But this soon went away, and it's got even worse since the Labour leadership election. Right now three of the top ten stories are about Corbyn's campaign. And anyone that disagrees with the Corbyn side of the argument in such discussions is now also a shill, paid-off, Tory-lite, brainwashed by the media, without compassion, etc etc. God forbid if you are actually a Conservative supporter, let alone a UKIP supporter.

* does it make financial sense? Without considering the savings on a gym membership, in your experience, is it possible not to buy a monthly / yearly travelcard and just use pay-as-you-go when it rains, and still be in the money, or does it rain far too often? I must say I'd rather avoid cycling even when it drizzles in the winter, but I can make the effort if it's worth it.

* is it safe enough? Roughly, Citymapper tells me to go through Shoreditch High St station --&gt; Whitechapel station --&gt; Salmon Ln (Limehouse) --&gt; Westferrey station --&gt; office. Is this a horrifying route in the morning or is it safe? I'd very much like not to be one of those people who just don't give a shit and cycle slow as hell on the bus lane, but would also like to avoid dying a horrible death in the middle of traffic. Alternatively, is there a different (read: safer) route you would recommend?

* ~~is it doable? This is my biggest concern. I have to wear a suit at work and there are no changing rooms / showers there, so I would have to wear my suit while cycling. Is this possible or will I just get to work looking like hell? I do sweat quite heavily, but if the route is relatively plain and I can take it slow without fear of being crushed it might be doable.

I was listening to the Pink of the TAW player. The general consensus on social media and apparently at the matches is that the wins weren't convincing. 

Why are some of our fans so downtrodden? 6 points is 6 points. It took Liverpool until the second part of the season to get 2 straight clean sheets, now we have 2 in a row at the start of the year. This is a platform to build on. I don't get the negativity. 

Benteke made a huge impact last night, Clyne looks great, Firmino will obviously still be rusty, Ibe hasn't exactly hit full strides but the workmanship and desire of Milner is fantastic. 

Of course Bournemouth were gonna be no pushover. It was one of their biggest games. I think people just need to calm down and realize Liverpool have a full season to build upon this. 

I mean, Mignolet hasn't even had to make a save yet. He looked just okay coming out on crosses but jeez.

I saw some comments in the post-match thread which were positive and that's good. Winning is winning, god damn.

We would love to see the game, so we checked out the Swansea ticketing website this morning, the day they went on sale. But by the time we checked, there were not even two seats left together. let alone three. Obviously, we should have gotten on it when they first when on sale in the U.K. and not first thing in the morning here on the U.S. east coast.

So, my question: what's the best way to get three affordable tickets for this game? Are there usually people selling their tickets second-hand at the gate? Or maybe via craigslist?

Any help you could provide would be massively appreciated! Really looking forward to our time in Wales.

With the rumor of Fazio leaving for £5m and not to mention all the wages we no longer have to pay from offloading that number of players, that leaves a lot of money to bring players in.

I think it wouldn't be unfair to expect at least 2 Signings come in hopefully a striker and a defensive midfielder.

#My Main point being Levy has been Levy this window, although he sorted out our defense early on in preseason we haven't had a good transfer window unless we make two big signings. e.g Saido Berahino

Quite frankly... it's bollocks.

How left-wing were the policies in [the manifesto](http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/BritainCanBeBetter-TheLabourPartyManifesto2015.pdf)?

This is what we would do on the economy (in brackets is my comments):

Labour will:
* cut the deficit every year and balance the books as soon as possible in the next Parliament (Centrist)

* reverse the 50p tax cut so that the top one per cent pay a little more to help (Slightly left-wing but has [61% support](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/01/28/majority-support-50p-tax/))

* get the deficit down (they said the same thing twice)

* not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax, National Insurance or VAT (Not left wing)

* cut and then freeze business rates and maintain the most competitive corporate tax rates in the G7 (Not left wing)

* abolish non dom status (Left wing but has [77% support](http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2015/04/09/non-doms-public-overwhelmingly-back-labour-policy))

* increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October (Left wing ish, a bit shit to be honest, and the Tories did it and it was popular; The Tories beat us on fairness)

* 2019 and introduce Make Work Pay contracts to provide tax rebates to firms (Left wing, but living wage is popular, arguably not strong enough)

* becoming Living Wage employers 

* ban exploitative zero-hours contracts (Catchphrase! [56% support](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/08/12/ban-zero-hour-contracts/))

* guarantee an apprenticeship for every school leaver who attains the grades and require any firm that gets a large government contract to offer apprenticeships (Arguably left wing, but fairly partisan and popular all round)

* reduce tuition fees to £6,000 a year (Fairly left, not very, 56[% support](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/04/14/voters-prefer-tuition-fee-cut-reducing-inheritance/))

* freeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter ([Left-ish, 50% support](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/04/11/british-attitudes-household-energy-market/))

* introduce a British Investment Bank and support a network of regional banks. (I don't think I heard anyone talk about this throughout the election)

This is on just the economy, and I could analyse other things, but this is supposedly what people need to ""trust us on"". But very few of these policies are particularly left wing, and all of the left wing policies we did put up had 50% support.

That’s disgusting. How dare they swap that fucking dog, right!?

...Do you know what happened last Wednesday? It was Earth’s ‘overshoot day’ – the day each year when our demands of the planet outstrip its ability to regenerate. It came six days earlier than 2014, meaning we have now used our 2015 quota of resources… It’s only bloody August!!! Apparently the world’s population is currently consuming the equivalent of 1.6 planets resources a year. The Global Footprint Network estimates that human consumption first began to exceed the Earth’s capacity in the early 1970s and the overshoot day has been falling steadily earlier ever since, due to the growth in the global population alongside the expansion of consumption around the world. If we continue to consume at this rate (and I have no doubt that our consumption will actually go up from what we are currently using) we'll blow the global carbon budget and lock in more than 2C of global warming in 17 years, 124 days and 10 hours.

This didn't appear in the Daily Mail this year. In fairness it did last year... In the science section. Is this not front page newsworthy!?

I would say so. After all, at 2C the very existence of some atoll nations is threatened by rising sea-levels. Limiting warming to 1.5C may restrict sea level rise below 1 metre. Yet even at 1.5C warming, regional food security risks are significant. Africa is particularly vulnerable, with significant reduction in staple crop yields in some countries. As if they haven’t got the food situation hard enough!

They will probably die for our sins. They’re a bit like Jesus in that respect, only much less marketable. 

At first I didn’t think it would matter either (I mean it’s only Africa, right?) but apparently between 1.5C-2C increase mountains lose their glaciers people will lose their water supplies. The entire Indian subcontinent will be fighting for survival. As the glaciers disappear from all but the highest peaks, their runoff will cease to power the massive rivers that deliver vital freshwater to hundreds of millions. Water shortages and famine will be the result, destabilising the entire region. 

Phew! Not us then. So then I thought ""it’s only Africa and India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan… Who cares, we can build new ones!""

THEN I read that at current rates the whole Greenland ice sheet would vanish within 140 years. Miami would disappear, as would most of Manhattan. Bummer, would have loved to go there. Oh well! 

Central London would be flooded. WAIT? LONDON!?!?!? That’s near where I live!!! Me! ACTUAL me!!! Jesus! Bangkok, Bombay and Shanghai would lose most of their area. 

In all this would result in half of humanity becoming refugees that need to move to higher ground. More migrants fleeing death, starvation and danger!?!? But I’ve already been told by the Daily Mail that we can’t even handle the few thousand currently in Calais! 

""Half the world, 3.5bn people coming over here, taking our jobs!? Makes you sick…""

Memphis has gotten a lot of hype. Highlights of his long-range goals, raw athleticism, and mazy runs catch the eye, but so do his stats: most goals in the Eredivisie (22) 2014/15, and a freakish amount of free-kick goals (7).

His goals will be important, because at the time of writing this post, Man U has very few attacking options. Rooney and Hernandez are the *only* strikers available, and the creative/attacking midfielders of Mata, Janjujaj, Fellaini, Herrera, and Young scored 23 goals between them for the 2014/15 season, just 1 goal more than Memphis for the same period.

But let’s take a closer look at what it took to get those 22 goals. Below is a chart of the eight biggest shot monsters in the EPL for 2014/15 compared with Memphis:

Name | Shots* | Goals | Conversion Ratio 
---------|----------|----------|----------
Aguero|200|21|.10
Austin|144|18|.125
Pelle|128|12|.094
Sanchez|140|16|.114
Kane|148|21|.142
Lukaku|125|10|.08
Coutinho :(|126|5|.04
Ings|109|11|.101
Memphis|218|22|.101
*Total shots taken in 2014/15 including blocked shots, adjusted as if all players had played an equal amount of minutes (3420 min, i.e. every minute of every game).

Clearly the only one who runs around with the safety off as much as Memphis is Aguero. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing if Memphis’s conversion ratio is respectable, which it is, at least when compared against the EPL’s most profligate shooters.  

But taking that many shots does have a downside; it led to Memphis being one of the most wasteful players in the Eredivisie. In fact, only Samuel Armenteros of Anderlecht gave up possession more times than Memphis last season.

Now let’s take a closer look at how Memphis scored those 22 goals. What’s noteworthy is not only the amount of freekicks and pens he scored (7 freekicks and 2 pens) but also the types of goals he scored from open play (13). [In this video of all his 22 goals from the 2014/15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2kFLRM3FSw), there emerges a pattern: 7 of his 13 open play goals could be considered tap-ins/expected conversions (specifically numbers 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 19). It could be argued that he helped manufacture some of these goals by his running off the ball or his sheer pace, but none of these 7 goals could be said to be of any unique quality or above the level of any EPL winger. 

If we accept that 7 of his 13 goals from open play were tap-ins, then only 6 of his 22 goals were notable goals from open play, and that is very very few from a player who takes more shots on average than any other EPL player. 

Between the hype and Man U’s reliance on his goals, Memphis will ultimately disappointment. Amazingly he is only 21, and what’s more, he will be adjusting to playing in a new league and at a higher level. His freekick prowess will likely translate over to the EPL, but given the evidence, and the fact that he only had 3 assists last year, he likely will not be the high-flying, Dutch-Ronaldo Man U fans hope him to be.

There's a long way to go but you may as well pack up now.  The cream has risen to the top and that one point lead looks pretty insurmountable to me.

As ever, feel free to take a look at the leaderboard (click column headers to sort) on our wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/wiki/crystalfootball

While I've tried to take care about getting everyone's scores right Please do double check that your score looks accurate and let me know if there appears to be a mistake.

Keep an eye out for week 3's prediction thread later this week!

My family consists of myself (21f), my boyfriend (21m), my sister (18f) and my mother (50f).

We live on an estate which is basically a cul-de-sac. The girl in question lives on my estate and her house is just down the road. We are not neighbours but I guess she lives close.

Last summer is when the girl started behaving in a rude manner towards my family. First instance was her kicking over a bucket of weeds and stuff while my Mum was in the front garden doing some gardening and ran off. We were kind of shocked at that but just put it down to normal rebellious kid behaviour and didn't really do anything about it. There were a few other incidences that summer of her ""giving attitude"" towards us as we would get out of our car and bring the shopping in. Basically being rude to us without us doing anything to provoke that kind of behaviour. Again, we just kind of ignored it and assumed that this was just some weird phase that she would grow out of. We didn't want to cause any kind of fuss with her parents because like I said... She's just a kid.

Fast forward to now... Every time one of us leaves our house we are confronted by her shouting stuff like ""HELLO?!?!"" and ""What are you staring at?!?"". This usually continues all the way down our road until we leave. We all ignore her and don't make eye contact with her. I can't stress enough that there is literally nothing provoking this behaviour on our part. It's a very frustrating situation to know that whenever I get back home/leave my house, I am going to have a bratty kid shouting something at me. It's also very embarrassing.

The last straw was her running into my Mum as she left the house and pushing past her. My Mum went to her house and confronted her parents about it. They basically said that my Mum was lying about the situation because, and I quote, ""they go to church"".

Confronting the parents and asking them to please have a talk with their daughter did nothing. We are still receiving constant shouting and ""brattiness"". She has also began standing outside of our house right next to our gate which I think is some kind of intimidation tactic as she knows that her parents are on her side in all of this.

We have begun to record these incidences on our phones, however her parents don't seem to be interested in the evidence of their daughter's behaviour. Is there anything we can do to get this kid to leave us alone?

**Edit: Another incident just happened in the last hour of the girl and her friends blocking my Mum and sister's path to our house when they were coming home from the dentist. We just had several parents banging our door down and intimidating us because they believe we are in fact the ones harassing their children. We just called the police. This is crazy.

We plan to start on online tournaments and if the team is going well take part in LANs. If interested you need to be able to stick to a schedule for when practise is and be able to take and give criticism.

Mainly that gallifrey is back- because of the coordinates shown on the screen, and a (potentially taken out of place) line from Capaldi saying ""I've been here before""

This is also supported by the leak on 4chan, saying that gallifrey will be back.



It also says ""pocket universe""- meaning where gallifrey is?


This makes me think that Missy was right- gallifrey is still in the same _coordinates_ that the doctor left it, however it is just in a pocket universe after Dotd, the doctor just doesn't know how to get to it.

It also shows what seems to be a new sonic screwdriver.

I am writing a match preview for your game against Sunderland for a Sunderland blog. I would love to hear your thoughts on the questions below! Feel free to ask me any back, for anyone doing something similar.

Your season has gotten off to a great start. How much of that is down to Garry Monk?

On paper, your squad looks to have depth in almost every position. Which areas should the club be looking to strengthen before the transfer window closes?

What are realistic expectations for Swansea this season?

The last time both teams met, the game finished 1 - 1. What’s your prediction for the game?

So I'm 22 and a teacher bringing in around 1300 a month. Next Monday I'm going to be moving in with my partner and want to start saving / investing some of my extra money for the future. I reckon I'll have about 300 left over a month (got to love high insurance for young male drivers) and I know that I am not the best at saving / not squandering money. 

So my question for you all is, what can I do with my money, where can I put it, so that if I want to get married in a few years I will have a nice little pot to use. I also don't mind investing it, but have no clue so would defiantly need pointing in the right direction with that. I wouldn't need to access the money right away, this isn't an emergency fund, but I would like to be able to add to it every month with what I have spare.

In fact most of his colleagues have never been to uni at all, they did btecs or similar qualifications at college.

He hasn't had much luck with getting a better engineering job. His latest rejection was without having an interview. But he was rejected on the grounds that he wasn't qualified enough. But the job only required a bachelors and people don't usually do a PHD in engineering unless they want to go into lecturing.

His application was via an online form and the rejection email was from one of those 'no reply' addresses that are automated. But he is curious as to what they want from him that would make him more qualified! We are also wondering if they've managed to overlook the masters and think he only has a bachelors and that they got other applications from people with masters who they did spot. He just did the one degree, which was a 4 year course, so the education section on his CV just has one item for higher education.

 So should he contact them? But if so how? There's a few email addresses for the company, but nothing that seems relevant to recruitment.

Basically, I am writing this to see if anyone on here is interested in making an indie movie with me from the ground up (funding, scripting, shooting, post-production etc). They say filmmaking is a collaborative process so why don't you send me an email if you want to get together sometime and craft this fucker out. I don't require any acting, writing or directing skills nor experience from anyone because I have none myself - all I'm looking for is a partner who shares a rich love for films and is equipped with a strong creative drive.
I'm not saying it will be a fast or easy process (the best films never are), but if you want to get together and do this, just get in contact and we'll talk this out. I'm sure it'll be fun as hell and worth the hard work in the end.
I should mention that as an 18 year old, I unfortunately have social and school commitments - but I don't think this thing should be rushed anyway. If you are of a similar mindset, please email me or of course comment below and I'll reply - let's get this project on the road.
As a final note, I want to state upfront that what I propose is a full-on 50/50 partnership - meaning equal billing, equal input and equal glory. I have thought about contacting existing indie filmmakers about collaborating on a project but decided that doing this from the ground up would be the best option - I want to meet someone who is both equally ambitious and driven by passion to work with.
Please email me at psmith944@LIVE.co.uk or leave a message below to get in contact - and while you're at it you might aswell tell me a bit about yourself and the types of movies you're into (I myself am a HUGE Stanley Kubrick buff).

The EPL is gaining popularity in strides here in the states and my friends have been pressuring me to pick a team. (Two Everton fans and a Liverpool fan if you were wondering.) So, I did. I have decided to pledge my allegiance to West Bromwich Albion FC. There doesn't seem to be too much support out this way, so I'm glad to start spreading the good word. I've familiarized myself with some history and I'm ready to watch Chelsea go down this weekend. Any good twitter accounts, blogs or articles that will help me would be great. But for now, I'm looking forward to making this subreddit more active.

However, when it comes to an exam/mock exam, I ""choke"" / ""tilt"" and usually end up doing horribly than I usually do in class.

My sixth form entry requires 6 GCSEs with 2 must being English Language and Maths with C or above. I've already secured 2 GCSEs at with being at a B. (early entry for Science Core+Additional). In the worst case scenario I don't get the grades needed. What choices are there? (I haven't applied for college yet)

Since the last mocks, I've only failed 2 papers whilst doing worse on the ones I've passed. (e.g getting Cs/Bs rather than As).

The very first mocks I've done, I did absolutely incredible for my standards getting As/Bs and the odd A* with only 1/2 Cs one being in Music.

Overall, I'm just very very nervous that I've messed up my exams and maybe it's just that I need someone to be like ""it's gonna be okay"" or maybe I'm overreacting. I just want some advice to be prepared and not have a panic attack on the day.

How important exactly are my GCSEs, is my life screwed if I do badly? This may seem silly but I do have a passion for esports but I cannot find a way to link that to school or benefit from it in my life. 

 Also, how do I face my parents if I get poor results? (I'm Chinese and they expect me to get good grades, stereotypical.)

I am very sorry if it seems I'm just ranting on randomly and there is no structure, I just want to let me frustrations out and my parents aren't very understanding (neither of them have done GCSEs, both dropped from school for family reasons)

We were both on our way home when we almost had a minor car collision ([pic](http://imgur.com/NeQAkdR)) which could have been either of our fault (at the time I felt it was purely his fault), but nothing happened. He sounded his horn and I drove off.  Looking back I know I had right of way (he entered the oncoming lane of traffic), but sensibly I should have anticipated his manuever.

5 minutes after I have got in to my house, I see the driver walk past my front window. My parking space is outside my next door neighbours house so I assume he knocked there first. He knocked on my door, I answered and he started ranting about how I was an idiot driver and could have hurt his family. I was very reasonable and listened to what he had to say. He was verbally angry about dangerous drivers which in our area I have noticed as well (he considered me one of them). I understood his anger at dangerous drivers because I have felt the same before. I made no threats against him but did not admit to driving against the law. He wasn't physically agressive in any way but as he went to leave he made a threat to damage my car.

At this I pointed out there was no need for threats at which he came back and the argument started again over who's fault it was. He also said that I was 'lucky that his family wasn't in the car' (which goes against what he said earlier about his family actually being in the car, whom I did not see), not sure if that constitutes a threat or not. He also made claims that I was driving 'right up his arse', even though I make a point of never doing that. I feel that because we were at such low speeds (&lt;20mph) it could have been considered such from his point of view (i.e. distance between cars is lower if the speed at which you are driving is lower), however I think I always maintain a reasonable stopping distance between my car and the car in front.

Traffic incident aside, if you can call it that because nothing actually happened, I still feel uneasy.

Point is, I don't know this guy, it's a criminal offence to make a threat to damage someone's property if the threatened (me) feels it is genuine. My girlfriend witnessed the whole confrontation from the door. I don't know whether or not to take the threat seriously or consider it something said in the heat of anger.

I don't speed or drive recklessly, I feel like it was an unfortunate incident resulting from lack of judgement on both our parts. More so on my part because I usually anticipate what other drivers are doing and make allowances. Either way I feel like the traffic incident is minor compared to his threat against my property.

I know Firefox for one is a whizz and genius at this.

Well i bought them with an idea it's a well-regarded brand on SkincareAddictionUK, but now can't find OZ in the Search so must have had a brain-scramble... Have i goofed &amp; bought something stupid?

Their lack of alcohol was attractive - I avoid alcohol like crazy - &amp; the oodles of natural ingredients of course... But when it comes to the hardcore actives, the Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol, are they the 'right' kind, in the 'right' quantity? Do they look like well-balanced formulae? I've always used serums for comfort merely - you know, humectant primer beneath moisturiser - rather than in expectation of great improvement. In fact one of my few forays onto the counters of Technological Miracles, Lancome's Généfique, had me eczema-monstering so bad i trotted back to John Lewis for refund &amp; grumble. I *have* found that anything-hyaluronic super-works for me. But I'm just a dummy learner at the chemistry. The Vitamin C in especial, i seriously can't get a handle on which type one goes for...

KasparMauser has sensitive, easily-dehydrated skin. And the retinol i would only tentatively confine to the forehead.

Hoping it's OK to post the links, coz there's masses of info &amp; discourse there... They claim the C Serum is Amazon's no. 1 serum seller btw. For what that's worth :-)

Thanks ever so for any response.

Ever since Moreno subbed in the last 10 minutes I haven't been able to get this formation out of my head. I tried to put a lineup with players Rodgers would realistically start with. I think we all see that Rodgers is choosing Gomez ahead of Moreno because he is better defensively but we are lacking going forward without Moreno in the team. Not to blame Gomez though, for an 18 year old natural CB he is doing an amazing job. 

Anyways. Do you think a lineup like this would work against Arsenal? Would it even work at all? I would love to see Clyne on the right and Moreno on the left and don't know how we would still stay strong defensively without the 3 at the back. 

In case anyone is wondering Hendo is not in the lineup only because he is injured atm and I wanted to make a lineup with the players Rodgers will most likely choose for the next game. The only one who gets dropped in this scenario is Ibe.

We are looking for a brilliant junior designer to fill an exciting internship at a FinTech company located opposite the Gherkin in central London.

The role will last for 3 months with a full time position available for the correct applicant.

The successful applicant will be proficient in the Creative Suite, passionate and enthusiastic about design, and have an impressive portfolio which demonstrates their potential and eye for detail. Knowledge of html/css would be beneficial but not essential, as would a degree in a relevant field.

The role will include assisting the senior designer in day to day tasks, helping to create leaflets and white papers, updating and maintaining the front-facing website, and various other additional tasks. This will also be an opportunity to show initiative within the company and to learn and develop under the guidance of our experienced designers/developers.

The applicant will also receive lunch and travel expenses, as well as a MacBook Pro and guidance and support from our Senior Designer and CMO.

To apply for the role, please email us at jobs@pay4later.com with a relevant CV and portfolio

Hi all,

I am new to this subreddit and would like to become a more active participant. I would love to get some motivation from you aswell. I am a recent graduate, waiting to start a new job in a few weeks. Although I am running low on funds at the moment I will be bringing in £1500 per month once I start. However, after paying rent, bills, train tickets, car insurance, council tax and fuel alongside the daily essentials, I struggle to see how I will have a meaningful amount left to put away for savings later on in life.

At the moment all I can foresee is me easily spending the little bit I have left over on weekend activities. Sometimes I think why should we bother saving anything as we have little control over our lives - such as a tragedy if you saved for your retirement all your life and died early.

Do any of you have any tips to give me motivation to start saving? Or do any other graduates feel the same? After 5 years of uni I somehow expected a little more reward.

I wanted to ask this question because i believe that Scottish football can do better than it is now. i want to know what other people think might help the league and national team improve? do you think it would take league reconstruction, the spl running its own TV channel, fan ownership of clubs, lower ticket prices, summer football perhaps? or do you feel that things are alright as they are?

Hope this is in the right place, apologies if not. 

I recently reversed into a Vauxhall Agila on my street. I have no defence really other than it being a very tight dead end terraced street that has been the bane of my life since I moved in. Also: Some of the stereotypes about female drivers are true in my case. While trying to ease past a car on my right, I hit the car on my left. Am an idiot, etc. 

Owner of car witnessed this so we surveyed damage. My cars paint had rubbed off on her car at front driver side, very near wing mirror. Cosmetically, I had it worse and it generally appeared that because I had been going incredibly slowly, I had rubbed against her car rather than banged it. 

Yesterday, she came to me with a quote for £486 for ""body repairs to the O/S/D door and O/S/R door, repaint to colour and blending as required."" It breaks down as £175 for paint and materials, £230 for labour then VAT. 

She says the mechanic, who is her friend, had determined that I had bumped the panel quite hard and he'd have to remove it to see inside. She was quite specific that he wanted the money in cash. 

Having seen the car since, there is no visible damage whatsoever but she says she can push the panel in further than she should be able to. 

She suggested we don't claim through our insurance as her mechanic friend told her insurance would insist on two new doors on the car which would be far more expensive. As I don't have nearly £500 in cash (or on card, for that matter), I told her that insurance was my only option. She was very very insistent that I don't involve insurance company and that her mechanic friend was the only way. 

I fully accept responsibility, obviously. I'm not trying to get out of paying. It's just that something in her manner was very strange, especially regarding the insurance. 

As it stands now, I am getting quotes from a couple of local garages. 

My question is does anybody know anything about Vauxhall Agila body repairs? Does any of this sound strange or does it all seem above board? 

Thanks in advance (and sorry for essay)

EDIT: I have informed my insurance company. They said it sounded like she was trying to get extra repairs out of me. It's out of my hands now though. Premium will go up but at least I'm protected from here. 

Thank you very much for the helpful advice. I'll be back when I want to upgrade from my Ford Fiesta! ",false,CarTalkUK,t5_2w2lq,null,null,self,Vauxhall Agila body advice,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/comments/3hkchj/vauxhall_agila_body_advice/

WHAT IT IS: A cabaret night - I started the Sofa Sessions in my living room in Jan 2010, as a way to bring musicians, visual artists and other creative people together to share their work with an audience who weren't separated from them by the stage/floor thing. I got asked to move them to the Ulster Hall in 2010, and ran 4 events there before I moved away. I perform a couple of tunes with some of the musos and chat to them about their work - it's meant to be like the Jools Holland Show only with more than music. They've been great nights with brilliant artists and lovely audiences, and I wanted to do one as a fundraiser for a mental health charity this summer.

WHO'S INVOLVED: The Duncairn are letting me have the venue for free, the soundman's working for free and all of us are performing for free - I've got a brilliant line-up: BEATnDRUM Samba Band, The Dogg Ruff String Band, Rory Nellis, Jenna Smith (from NYC), short films ""Cleansed"" by Paul Caddell (produced by Canderblink, of Good Vibrations etc) and ""Orchard Road"" by a Finnish duo and Lamb Films (nice wee NI/Finland collaboration, shot in Armagh and screened at Tampere International Film Festival - I was there and the audience really enjoyed it) and poetry from Colin Dardis and Geraldine O'Kane.

The audience has always been encouraged to get involved - impromptu house band forming for them if they want to sing, etc.; I've rammed 4 hours full of acts but have included time for an audience singalong (prob Three Little Birds and La Bamba/Twist and Shout) for the craic. 

It's BYO, cabaret seating, and I've a raffle on the night of arts and wellbeing prizes (coasteering, firewalking vouchers, signed art work, vouchers for portraiture, CDs from local artists, vouchers from local restaurants/food businesses) to maximise donations to the charity. Entrance is give-what-you-can-afford; no need to book, tho' you can book a place if you'd like to be sure of a seat. Doors at 7pm for 7:30pm start; ends at 11:30pm.

I'd love you's to come to the event, spread the word about it, maybe donate something to the raffle (anything that's related to arts and/or to wellbeing); I'd be very grateful for any of these forms of support! Thanks for reading, and...

I am 24, earning roughly £25k p/a, and I've never had a credit card. My only debt is student debt, I bank with Lloyds who have offered me a credit card, but I want to go with Virgin's 3in1 because it's 0% for 24 months and honestly [I want the free wine](http://uk.virginmoney.com/virgin/credit-cards-aggregators/all-round/msm/?source=MSM-ALL-00001-00031).

I went to Money Saving Expert's [eligibility calculator] (https://creditcards.moneysavingexpert.com/?imgux) and entered my info, but I cannot be found at the credit bureau. I'm guessing this is because I don't have any other credit. Does this mean I'm unlikely to be accepted? I don't want to damage my score by being rejected. 

If anyone has/knows anything about this card that would be great also. My plan is to just buy my next installment of car insurance on it, and one other thing that will bring me up to the £1000 required for the wine, and nothing else, just pay it off regularly to build some credit. 

Edit: I should probably clarify that the wine obviously isn't the main reason I'm getting the card. It looks like a good deal but I don't know much about them, hence the post.

I don't seem to have an issues riding in town traffic, just when I try and pick up speed.

Obviously I'm trying to be conscientious, and pull over regularly in order to let the traffic flow but really feel like I should be able to keep up.

I'm assuming this is all me, as far as my inexperienced eye can make out the bike is fine, tread/pressure/etc. But having said that could anyone recommend somewhere in Leicestershire or maybe Lutterworth to get it serviced?",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,Gaining confidence to speed/corner,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/3hkrur/gaining_confidence_to_speedcorner/

Giamatti has clearly watched and studied Richard Dreyfusss performance in Jaws a few too many times, but thankfully, whatever actorly choice he was making, he gives up midway through. Its not like she gets hit with a flying sign like Tim Bagley in the Day After Tomorrow or loses it like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Twister, so I ask you what is the point? Its great to see Archie Panjabi since leaving The Good Wife, but I question why she wanted to do the thankless role of the reporter which seems to be in EVERY one of these roles. Its just that disaster movies like this, and especially this one, feel so insensitive to actual natural disasters, and the pleasure of the viewing experience is so focused on watch stuff get destroyed that it is hard to think anything besides why am I watching this, then leaving the theater feeling kind. This is pretty hard to forgive, especially when you watch extended disaster sequences which relish showing death and distraction like theyre something to be held in awe. Johnstone Burt and Parkinson are a bit to precious and grating. He goes to the Hoover Damn to test his machine, which is subsequently destroyed, but not before a character saves a stranger which happens exactly twice in this movie. Here is the thing about the new movie San Andreas, expected to be the box office winner this weekend: its kind of gross. The movieif the plot is importantis about The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson aka Ray, a fire and safety rescue pilot. If this movie were about survival and human nature, this might make for an interesting and impactful part of the story. Ray cancels his trip to take his daughter to college and is sent to help with search and rescue. Shortly after, he received several hateful messages and comments calling him out for what he said. But here, he doesnt just fail in the role, personality wise, he is incredibly unlikable. That s why Dwayne is perfect for the role he s playing in San Andreas. Director Brad Peytons last film also starred Johnson in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. Dwayne Johnson Fights Earthquakes To Save Californians From The Big One In New San Andreas Trailer. And when Blake realizes they are going in the wrong direction to be safe from the aftermath of the quakes, she says nothing to any of the people marching to their death. Tags Can You Believe Babe Is Turning 20? Then there is Paul Giamatti playing a scientist, who has discovered a way to predict earthquakes. He took to to defend his previous statement by tweeting: Image via Lia Toby/. He drives past an elderly couple waving for help on the side of the road, and only offers them help after realizing they were trying to save them. And while Ill never say that movie is good, it is way more enjoyable than San Andreas. Lieber Grand Theft Auto Fan, wir freuen uns sehr, dass Du zu m gestoßen bist.

So basically, if it is on Sky it will be streamed - if not, no chance. Apparently we used to be able to get streams because the games were being shown in Malaysia (the stream was then replicated most weekends and available). While there is the off chance that during the season the opposition may have games up online, like QPR, most clubs bought into lengthy deals with Perform Group for the substandard 'player' platform many years ago. So we shouldn't expect any changes until that contract expires, which according to the club is next year.

He told me he does it because his friends are doing it, and he tries to copy what they do, to fit in. His friend Olojo (12) steals whole chickens using this method (these chickens are usually £4 to £6 each), and Olojo has been doing it for 2 years. 

I told him to pay full price as he can get in trouble and told him maybe purchase only 1 item so he doesn't have to steal ,as punishment I am trying to get him to volunteer with a soup kitchen, but can't seem to find any.

Throwaway for obvious reasons, ~removed~

~removed~ I've been applying for jobs &amp; apprenticeships for quite some time, and had 2 interviews before the incident (both apprenticeships). 

We were all very drunk on a weekend, very late night. I was arrested a while after a fight broke out between my mate and another guy, no weapons were used. The fight was on CCTV apparently. The guy did provoke my mate, but he was badly hurt (~removed~). ~removed~

I didn't hit the guy, I just didn't know what to do at first, then pulled my mate away from him after the guy got knocked to the floor. He was laying on the road, so I picked him up and dragged him to the pavement. ~removed~

After that we got stopped by police around the corner. I was really drunk or I would've ditched my shit. They found the following on me: 

* ~removed~  hash (~removed~)
* about six empty baggies
* 1 ~removed~ knife (i legitimately use this for cutting things like tape, but it's illegal since it 'locks' apparently. blade is just less than 3 inches)
* 1 pair of knuckle dusters (i carry these for self defence only when I'm carrying bud)

~removed~

**So...**

I'm on bail now, have to report back to the police station in two months. 

I think I'm fucked. Am I fucked? Is there any chance of NFA at all? 

Also, will the bail show up on a CRB check or whatever check recruitment companies / employers use?

TL;DR: 18yo being arrested for being involved in a fight, ~removed~and knuckle dusters. Fucked or not? And will bail show up on a CRB check?

I'm sure in most people's minds anything besides a #1 finish in the BPL would be unthinkable.

We're only 2 weeks in though. Granted we have looked absolutely superb in those 2 weeks. But sooner or later every team even those that win titles hit a slump. I think that is what will really determine the course of the season, how the team reacts and fights their way through adversity. It's easy to look good when everything is clicking on all cylinders. 

Honestly I think winning the UCL is still a bit out of reach. Even with KDB, Otamendi, Sterling and our standard core, our team is just not strong enough to fight the giants on equal terms (we could pull an upset). Not yet I give us a year or 2 before that happens. I see us progressing further than before, but then again that depends on the draw as much as anything. We're probably one of the top 5 teams in Europe at the moment, but not #1. 

As far as the BPL is concerned I think we should be the favorites at this point. But it is way too early to really consider us ""front runners"" or anything like that. Once again I think how we react to a slump will determine that.

I watched both of Capoue's games with Watford and have seen every Stambouli performance with PSG. 

It is a bit frustrating to me how well they've been doing. Not because I want them to do poorly, but because I wish they'd done well for us.

Capoue seems to be the ticker of the Watford team. The guy was a beast in their first two games, especially this past weekend against West Brom. He had 83 passes with a completion percentage of 87%. He had 2 key passes. He completed 11 long balls. 

He made 3 tackles, 3 interceptions, and 2 clearances. He was named MOTM. 

Watford were placed on the back leg more against Everton, so he only had 35 passes, though he completed 92% of those. Defensively, he was great in that game. 3 tackles, 5 interceptions, and 5 clearances. 

Stambouli's stats are far less impressive, mostly because he's been brought on as a sub for Thiago Motta in the last twenty minutes. But he's done quite well in that deep-lying DM role when he's come on. He recycles possession well, puts good pressure on attackers, and has fit into their system quite quickly.

He won't be starting anytime soon, but that's only because he's on fucking PSG.

I guess this is a ""What could have been"" thread. 

Whatever happened between Capoue and Poch is very disappointing because I feel he could very well be the DM that we needed.

Is it a load of media hype, or should I rightly be worried?

on their website it says that there is no way to delete an account. i want to be able to delete it from facebook and my phone and completely. are they legally able to do this? not give you an option to delete an account?

So I want to get into the National League (Conference) whatever you’d like to call it. I’ve always followed the Premier League and the Championship. But I’d like to see how different the lower leagues are.

Started reading the 2015/16 preview by r/lewatfc and it’s extremely helpful for someone starting to get to grips with the Conference.

I have a couple questions.

Is there anywhere to watch Conference matches? Maybe online somewhere or on TV?

Also and excuse my ignorance but to help me understand the teams better, can someone give me a list of “The Chelsea’s, the Man Utd’s, the Arsenal’s” of the Conference i.e. you might say - 

Grimsby = Arsenal - each season they put up a good fight for the title but always fall a little short.
Forest Green = Manchester City - many years of hurt but now they seem to be tipped to finish in the top two and gain promotion to League Two.

I think that would really help me understand what type of teams are the “winners” the “mid table” (Stoke, Spurs, Southampton - hard teams to play against but always finish mid table) and the “losers” (Sunderland, Hull City from last season).

The answer to this question the most important question At American University last week, President Barack Obama gave a vigorous defense of the Iran nuclear agreement. Putting all little fetishes before our God, and giving all sacrifice to them, to new, to shiney, to mighty, then what have we left for God Almighty? We have nothing to offer those people; and we still have the right to demand they live by our laws when here. It is certain that plenty of fanatics and jihadis are Muslim, but so are the people who are standing up to them Malala the Pakistani 12 year old shot and critically wounded by Islamists for attending school and advocating that other girls do so, Muhammad Ali Dadkhah in Iran, in. But on this night the host, Bill Maher, along with atheism advocate Sam Harris, had a vigorous debate with Actor Ben Affleck, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele. We need to show those zealots a perfect society working in all its ends and elbows before we demand their change for us. Last Friday night a rare dialogue/debate took place on American television. Only in the process of teaching the European tribes law were they weened away from their honor. They daily resite the oath which make a man a Muslim, and often. By the same card, we have no business telling them their culture is wrong with ours so far in decline. There were heroic Germans who fought Hitler and the Nazis. Who is it that wants to argue with the wisdom of ages? And virtually every free country in the world is in the Christian world. If liberals fall into that same trap as reactionaries, judging all on superficial examination for right or wrong, white or black; then they are more simple than good. Morals as an immediate form of social consciousness cannot be reduced to principals, and as principals, they would be useless. If the Muslim from where ever he resided comes here and makes war on women and our sensibility there is a home for him in prison. 15 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa. Where, sir, are the Christian and Jewish jihadists? He is a nationally syndicated radio show host and creator of m. It is the concern of an honorable people for their honor that binds all true Muslims to their faith. Your E mail: Your Password: Lost your password? To which Harris pointed out that there is no comparison between attacks on all members of a group and attacks on ideas: We have to be able to criticize bad ideas. To which Harris responded: I m actually well educated on this topic. Sam Harris then added: Liberals have really failed on the topic of theocracy. The law only forbids immorality, and does not demand morality. Things are not working out for this people, and isn t it a load of crap that there is no place better to run to than this snot heap we call home? It s like saying, I m not your shifty Jew comparing an antisemitic epithet to what Maher and Harris were saying. How can we determine what is morally right? Good works, and runs after understanding, and few are gifted with an understanding of their own culture enough to begin an objective examination of other cultures. Affleck, presumably not desirous of comparing his knowledge of Islam with that of Harris, moved on: You re saying that Islamophobia is not a real thing? The question of whether an assertion is true is of little or no interest to the left. Christians; they ll still get agitated over the abortion clinic bombing that happened in 1984, but when you talk about the treatment of women and homosexuals and free thinkers and public intellectuals in the Muslim world, I would argue that liberals have failed us. It is quite true that there are heroic Muslims who are fighting the Islamists throughout the Muslim world and that some of them have been murdered for doing so. To prove before the Muslim that we are immoral to the hilt while preaching the principals of morality which they understood, and which the West could only grasp by its Christian corruption, is a futile act. They certainly recognize that our swig is not the milk of human kindness; not for them or for each other. The uproar over the killing of a lion named Cecil in Zimbabwe by an American dentist, Dr. Walter Palmer, is Bill Maher, Ben Affleck and Islam. It is only honor that make a man a Muslim, and of course, the mercy of The God, Allah. They watch us on television and they can see the fruits of our immorality on display. If you want to ween the Muslim; you must first find out what he is drinking. We used to be just like them, and not better or worse. But it was later in the dialogue that Kristof expressed the most dishonest of the left s arguments on this issue: The great divide is not between Islam and the rest. It s rather between the fundamentalists and the moderates in each faith. Affleck continued, in answer to his own question. And the crucial point of confusion is that we have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry toward Muslims as people. One simply can t do against our laws what was business as usual in the hell from which they escaped. Liberal principles like freedom of speech, freedom to practice any religion you want without fear of violence, freedom to leave a religion, equality for women, equality for minorities including homosexuals these are liberal principles that liberals applaud for pointing to his audience, but then when you say in the Muslim. What can we teach them when their culture is in so many ways the parent of our own? Liberals see a complex and painful scene when they look at the world, and they choose reflexively on an inate emotional connection to do no harm if they can do no good. Affleck s first response to the indictment of the liberal double standard was to ask Sam Harris: Are you the person that understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam?

First off, fantastic news! We've come a long way in the past year- this is a great milestone to have hit so soon. Massive thanks to each and every one of you for making this place a success.

As is the norm when we hit significant membership marks, this thread should be considered an open consultation - what do you think we're doing well? What do you think we've been doing badly? What should we do instead? 

We've hit something of a lull post-election, with the only news of consequence popping up relating to the Labour Leadership contest. We don't anticipate this continuing for too long- but if you have any problems with the way the subreddit's handled things, or have suggestions as to how we can help liven things up, we're all ears.

Here's to the next thousand!

Are there any good football podcasts that you would suggest that are either weekly or daily?

I stopped watching ESPN and FOX Sports Live in the morning some time ago. And ever since my mornings before work have become really boring.

BBCs football section provides some decent reads each day, and I look at some of the other news sites to get most of my information. However, there are days that I don't want to or don't have the time to read the news, and just want someone else to explain it to me.

Since I don't have the money to hire a personal assistant to read the news to me, I figure a podcast is the next best thing. If there are any podcasts that you find particularly entertaining or interesting I would love the help finding something.

Not so long ago, he was heralded as the saviour of English football and a shoe in for International fullback for the next decade or so. Now the hype has died down, he can come back and jsut work hard without too much scrutiny.

He isn't going to displace Clyne and I think he is too good to be just a backup. I know Lovren is doing well right now, but thats possibly more to do with the guys in front of him. He still scares me every time he touches the ball.

Gomez has been doing great at RB but his main (and preferred) position is CB. Do you think Rodgers will move him there and break up the Skrtel/Lovren partnership so Flanagan can reclaim his spot?

Either way, we will soon have another good defensive back up to the first team. I wish we gave Wisdom a chance too, but I guess if it aint broke...

Apologies for the tons of questions, I dont post here very much but not seen much Flanno discussion here :)

thanks!

I think the only way to analyze our problems on this side is in conjunction with Willian and the strategy used here last year. 

If you look at their stats: Ivanovic had 6 goals and 7 assists (all comps) yet Willian only logged 4 goals and 5 assists (all comps). It is strange that our right FB had better attacking stats than our right AM. This is the obvious statement: Willian was constantly covering for Ivanovic when he pushed forward. 

This exchange wouldn't happen on the left because Azpi is right footed and Hazard was able to cover the offensive responsibilities. 

To fix this issue, I think one of a few things can or should happen. People have talked about Azpi to the right and Baba to the left, and that way we have this effect on the left (but we'll see). I like that, but in addendum, I think that Ivanovic should move into the middle and be competing with Cahill or Terry. Especially in the way that Mourinho subbed Terry, it seems that he knows that his defensive line has to change if he is not there.

Either way, the defensive line needs to change but the question is how and when.

It was in my name. When my brothers (A &amp; B) passed their tests it became 'our' car. With us out of the country/in jobs/at uni at different times, we shared varying use (and therefore responsibility for maintenance etc) for the past decade.

For the last 2 years A and I have been living together and sharing the car. In the last year we had to do a fair amount of maintenance - new (refurbished) gearbox, new clutch, new exhaust, new brake pads and disks, new (refurbished) callipers, new (second hand) door (someone dinged us badly). All in all, about £1000 of parts and work which A and I split the cost 50/50 of. A lot of it was necessary to keep the car running for work - and despite this long repair list it has been a really good car that even at 10 years old runs really well. This 1k was on top of the approx £600 annual cost of insurance + tax + MOT. 

I'm moving abroad. B has his own car now. A is living in London and doesn't need a car. When the car came up for renewal my parents suggested I take the car off the road (SORN) and store it at theirs - and in the time in between use a spare car of theirs. My mum owing to recent health problems can't drive anymore. When her car comes up for renewal they will probably SORN that too until she can drive again.

I found out yesterday that they sold my car to a good friend who has helped them out a lot in the past. I understand their reasoning - no one was using it, or will in the near future, and they were helping a friend out. It was in my name so to sell it without me realising they did sign on my behalf. I'm not bothered about this because if they'd asked I would have said yes sell the car!

My question is - am I and A entitled to ask for any of the money? Although they originally bought it, it was a gift to me. Me and my brothers have used it the last 10 years and all put money into the car. A has used it for the last 4 years, and I have shared it with him for 3 of those. I was thinking of asking for half of the money and splitting that with A. I don't want to get into a really complicated nit picky calculation and I don't want to be a dick to my parents. What would be reasonable?

TLDR; my parents sold the car they bought me 10 years ago. In the intervening 10 years my brothers and I have spent quite a bit of money maintaining the car.

This is the first trip to the Lane that I can actually remember as the other times I've been there was when I was a kid. The first time I was too small to see much of the match and, as my dad tells me, some of the crowd around me picked me up so I could see and got me chanting 'Come on ye Spurs'! :')

So it's been a long while coming and it really was an awe-inspiring tour. To see and feel all the history is indescribable. The photos of past greats, the trophies and the nostalgia is truly a sight to behold.

Some of you may have been on the tour before, but for those that haven't I will pick out a few photos which show some of my favourite highlights and give some context.

We both got off at Seven Sisters tube station and walked down High Road toward the stadium. The bustling atmosphere leading up to the stadium gives you a small sense of what a match day must be like. A stadium right in the middle of a vibrant community is a fairly uncommon sight these days and that first sight of the Lane is a special moment - http://i.imgur.com/BL5WlpD.jpg

Before going on the tour I knew that Bill Nic is (probably) the most important icon for our club, but I was surprised to hear the extent of how many years he dedicated. I believe the guide said that he had devoted roughly 65 years of his life to the club holding various roles. Such as player, coach, manager (for an astonishing ~16 years), chief scout and club president. His and his wife's ashes are buried beneath the ground. Rest in peace Mr Tottenham Hotspur - http://i.imgur.com/LaJON5i.jpg

The club has 2 Costa del Sol trophies in the Bill Nicholson suite. We won the tournament in consecutive years (1965 and 1966). The sheer size of them both is unbelievable. Take note of the plug sockets for comparison - http://i.imgur.com/GfhedEN.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Fw1Ef8a.jpg

Like most amateur clubs, when the club started out the players had to pay to play. The oldest piece of Spurs history is this ledger from 1890 - http://i.imgur.com/VaLh6u1.jpg

The original cockerel from 1910 is displayed in reception - http://i.imgur.com/5iCQkEi.jpg

To finish the essay are a photo of me and my brother outside of reception and a panoramic view of the ground from the director's box. Hope you guys enjoyed!

My husband and I have just had a worrying call with our letting agent. Our fixed period let is up in September but we were under the impression that one of 2 thing would happen :

* they would let it become a rolling/periodic tenancy
Or
* they would serve us our 2 months notice in time to make us leave by the end date

We'll apparently neither of those things are happening. They haven't given us notice yet. 

What are the options for us here? Do they still have to give us 2 month's notice if that goes beyond the end of the fixed term? 

Or are we going to find ourselves homeless in September? 

We didn't do another fixed term because we are looking to move across the country but wanting rolling because we don't have a move date.

I have Receiver s Vaudeville Years FM colelction and it s a mixed bag. This is the same on Show Biz Blues 2 disc t it sounds rough. I love hearing Kirwan and Green going at it. As far as I know, this set has never been issued on CD. Fleetwood Mac s second album after the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, 1977 s Rumours, produced four U.S. 74 or Ultrasonic, Hempstead or Bermuda Traingle L.A. On this show, the Rattlesnake Underway jam is over 14 min. After they play Elmore James Stranger Blues, they do an untitled instrumental composed by Danny Kirwin. I wish I had a better sounding one. I just looked at the track listing for SBB on Amazon UK. I figured this had to be officially released, but I haven t been keeping up with the FM archive releases after Showbiz Blues, which I made an 80 min. I ve been trying to get my hands on the whole concert in good quality, but so far I ve only been able to find Oh Well. Top 10 singles including Nicks song Dreams and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. Unfortunately, they fade the track about 6 or 7 minutes in. Or even San Berdoo Swing Auditorium with Peter Green filling in for Jeremy Spencer, which, although the qual. Is te, seems to be sourced from a soundboard. I have a DVD which was released by Image called The Original Fleetwood Mac The Early Years. Wonderful 1968 LIVE IN LONDON 1969 English Rose 1969 SHRINE 69 1969 The Pios Bird of Good Omen 1969 Then Play On 1970 Kiln House 1971 Future Games 1971 Fleetwood Mac original 1972 Bare Trees 19 Mystery to Me 1974 Heroes Are Hard to Find 1975 Fleetwood Mac remastered 19lbatross. I put on the FM at the BBC set earlier today and it appears that the first track is actually Rattlesnake Shake from the BBC concert. It contains some old B and from 1975 to 1987, as a more pop oriented act, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Jam from Fillmo East, although it hasn t surfaced. Long and the Manalishi Coming Your Way jam is 15 and a obably the best live FM I have, and even the Twist and Shout is pretty heavy, in the beginning at tually, the best live FM I have is from the Bob Welch era, and some of those best. The BBC has been broadcasting a lot of their archive material in England in high quality digital, so these things do occasionally turn up on bootleg ey can also be found at youtube, like this one: Click to expand. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening period between 19, with the line up including Bob Welch, during the 1990s in between the. I ve always loved that 15 minute version of Green Manalishi. Cheers, Chris This is the same on Show Biz Blues 2 disc t it sounds rough. The BBC has been broadcasting a lot of their archive material in England in high quality digital, so these things do occasionally turn up on bootleg ey can also be found at youtube, like this one: I don t know which particular BBC show you re referring to, but I do know. I don t know which particular BBC show you re referring to, but I do know that the BBC has a great black and white recording of early Peter Green era Fleetwood Mac. Yes, it appears to be the BBC concert on the second disc. To date the album has sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth highest selling album of all time. Paris Theatre, London broadcast on 4 19 Rattlesnake Shake Underway Stranger Blues World In The Harmony Tiger Kirwin The Green Manalishi Coming Your way Great Balls On Fire Twist And Shout Great. Does anybody know if this track was ever recorded in the studio either in a released or unreleased version? Cheers, Chris this is a great show, especially the long jam outs of Rattlesnake and Manalishi. I didn t know it was included on that set. I know FM has all this stuff in their archives, enough with the Peter Green era, which although great, is pretty much basic blues before the late 69 to 1970 stuff, ie, after they dosed with the Dead and started getting into improvisation, the end result being Then Play d. My tape is missing the announcer introduction which is on that CD. It contains really nice versions of Rattlesnake Shake as well as an extended version of Green Manalishi. Cdr of of all the Dead inspired Peter Green fueled jams, minus all the Jeremy Spencer cheese and then sold I called it Before The End of the Game. It would have made a great companion set to the BBC session double disc release.

Long story short, I am a British national and my partner is a Canadian national. She has studied here for the last 4 years, and is quickly approaching the end of the grace period at the end of a student visa without a job offer. What makes it even worse is that she has not lived in Canada since she was 3, and instead lived in France for most of her life. So at the end of next month, she will no longer be allowed to remain in the UK, nor France as her residence permit expires at the age of 21. The stakes of us finding a solution are very high, if nothing comes up in the next month then she would be forced out of the whole continent she calls home, to live in a country as a complete stranger. 

The search for a graduate job fulfilling the needs of the tier 2 visa has proven very difficult, and I think now is the time to explore other options or try to get to grips with some of the relaxations or otherwise.

* Has anybody been in this situation before?
* What did you do to stay together?
* Would marriage even provide a solution? (I am in full time study.)
* Are there any aspects of the tier 2 visa that I am missing?
* Does anybody know the details of any other EU countries' immigration policies?

I am getting pretty desperate here. Other options include her getting started in another EU country to at least save expulsion from the continent, and perhaps my emigration in a year or so.

At the start of my 3-month probationary period my manager made a verbal promise to me that at the end of my probation, she would give me a ""significant"" pay rise.

I know my two colleagues in the same department are both on £18,000 p/a. They do exactly the same work as me, work the same hours, etc. However, they have been employed by the company in the same department for several years longer than I have.

At a recent performance review I came out on top as having completed the most tasks (by quite a large margin). I am also usually the first in and last out of the office and am known by my manager to be the hardest working of the three. I'm often given extra duties which I take on as well.

At today's probation review, I successfully passed my probationary period. However my manager failed to make any mention of a pay rise. I raised this issue and pointed out the various points I have made above, to which my manager seemed very awkward and dismissed it as ""something she would have to discuss with HR"".

From experience, my manager is absolutely terrible at following things up and I know she won't follow this up with HR.

I also wonder whether there is an equality aspect here, I am paid less than one of my counterparts who is male for doing exactly the same work which I can prove I do more of and at a better quality. But, he's served longer in the company and is on a different ""pay grade"". I'm not sure if that's just an excuse or a legitimate workaround for the employers. I also don't want to whinge about gender equality etc. unless it's an absolute last resort.

**3'** [](//#yellow) Ryan Fredericks goes into the book for tripping the advancing Tom Adeyemi.

**10'** The offside flag denies Bristol inside the area after a well-worked move down the left. It's been a fast-paced start here.

**20'** Bristol have seen more of the ball so far but both keepers are yet to be tested.

**23'** Chance for Adeyemi at the back post, who rises to meet Phillips' cross but sees his header fly over the bar.

**23'** Two quick chances for the hosts as Silvestri saves well from Kodjia before Dallas hacks Flint's header off the line from the corner.

**26'** Phillips' near-post corner is met by Adeyemi, but his glancing header flies across the box and the hosts can clear.

**27'** Adeyemi's low strike is blocked on the edge of the box after good hold-up play from Wood.

**28'** Silvestri is forced into a strong block at his near-post to deny Bryan before the Bristol City winger fires his second attempt over.

**33'** Silvestri comfortably holds Kodjia's low strike from distance following a spell of pressure from Bristol.

**36'** [](//#yellow) Tom Adeyemi goes into the book for a 'foul' on Callum Robinson, but got the ball.

a new career, as someone in their late-teens/early 20's even if I have the same qualification or more life/work experience.

I'm looking for a new career (potentially training as an accountant, solicitor or something else in the finance industry) 
having come from something completely different. 


I've mentioned this to friends/family/strangers and the feedback I generally get is ""there's no way you'll be able to get 
a job with a good firm, they'll go for the 'fresh out school/university' person over you"".

The more I read up on various companies, their graduate or training schemes, they all seem to be geared towards people
finishing their A-Levels or graduates. Whilst this is completely natural and understandable (clearly most people applying
for these sorts of things will be that audience), I've looked into it a bit more and the people that generally get
accepted on traineeships/internships/schemes (whether graduate or non-graduate level) all seem to fit that mould of being
late teens/early 20's, fresh faced, good grades at school/university, probably was head boy/girl, captain of the rowing
team, good looking, perfect smile etc.



My grandmother mentioned that my cousin (who is 18 and just finished his A-Levels) has been accepted onto a traineeship
with Ernst &amp; Young (big international firm) having got good grades at A-Level. I said to her ""well I'm thinking of starting
a new career, that sounds interesting"" and her response was ""oh don't be ridiculous, you're in your 30's, you're past it"".



That whole attitude just got to me. I could have the exact same grades/qualifications, plenty of life and work experience
yet society and companies themselves seem to be biased towards the young, fresh faced, late teens/early 20's applicants
with no experience.

Look, I get he's English and shows great potential, but is he better than someone like Nicolas Otamendi? His reported value is £31mil, and can any of you actually explain to me why Stones is the better option? If you say we want more English talent, ok. But that's why Jose is planning on moving RLC into our squad more and more this season, right? We're loaning Christensen and Kalas out because we believe they can return more experienced and better.

What this transfer saga is showing me is that we don't trust in our own youth squad, our homegrown players and the players we've been touting for years. If anyone should be annoyed by this whole thing, it should be our youth! What they're seeing is their club looking to other teams for talent rather than giving them a chance. 

So what gives? Why are we trying to spend 40 million pounds on a defender who's still young and not at all a sure fire bet to be the next John Terry like we all have seemingly have hard-ons for? If anything we're just cutting corners there. JT was a product of our academy, Stones would just be another talented English lad we pried away from a smaller, albeit defiant team.

(84) Aluko puts the ball into the box - headed behind for a corner by Dembele 

(86) **GOAL!!!** Hull City 2- Fulham 1 (Sone Aluko)  The ball drops kindly for Aluko inside the Fulham box, who makes no mistake with a cool finish past Lonergan

So after my offer got accepted and I have chosen the solicitors, I now need to choose a mortgage product to apply for. I went to two mortgage brokers so far - the one affiliated with the agency (while still 'independent') and another chosen more or less randomly.

Both brokers claim that they have full access to the market (i.e. not suggesting from a limited subset of the products) and have picked several mortgages for me using those standardised KeyFacts forms.

The problem is that one of the products looks noticeably better than the rest (I know there is more than one dimension and the fine prints, so I put up a comparison spreadsheet and meditated over it). That product is suggested by the 'random' broker which will receive a commission (and the affiliated one won't for what they have suggested).

At the same time when I go to the popular mortgage comparison websites, I can see even better products available (although those websites require less details about my financial situation that I have submitted to both brokers).

Such discrepancy with just two brokers involved raises the following questions:

1. Do I need to pay attention to those comparison websites at all or it is very likely that since the cheaper mortgages were not selected by the brokers, it is very likely their lenders will reject me anyway (websites don't 'know' as much about my finances)? 

2. Since brokers suggest different products, do I need to go to as many of them as possible? Does it matter that they are close to the area I am buying in (which I believe is the case with solicitors)? 

3. The broker that suggested more expensive products will not receive a commission for them, but they still didn't suggest that cheaper product where they would have received a commission (potentially). Does that mean they are simply more sober about my finances and I need to go with their products because I will have a significantly lower chance of a rejected mortgage?

Any other relevant advice or links are also much appreciated.",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,"Choosing a mortgage product via broker, layman FtB questions",6,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/3hm9zq/choosing_a_mortgage_product_via_broker_layman_ftb/

I think a female Doctor with a female companion is no problem at all, the problem would be with a male companion.  I am not saying that I dislike the notion of a make being the secondary character I want to make that very clear.  My issue here is that if a male companion talks to a female doctor the way that female companions had spoken to a male doctor in the past than the sexism backlash would be biblical.  I have no objection to a female Doctor as long as the writers tread carefully and if they use a male companion they MUST change the dynamic a little for the sake of PR.  Can you imagine what it would look like if we swapped the genders of Donna and the Doctor, think how sexist it would look if Donna was a man and the Doctor a women given the attitude Donna portrayed at times? 

Now we all know some people will see sexism involved in some way if we have a female Doctor no what we do.  I am not concerned with small stupid questionable crap that people interpret as sexist I am worried about large scale obvious sexism.

So, there's meetup.com, on which we could organise and maybe sidelink to (if the mods agree), but after going through the hoops to create a test one it appears it's a paid subscription service. I'm willing to dole out a few quid of my hard-earned for a few months to donate a meetup thing to the sub, but only if this post gets at least enough upvotes to get visibility, and result in at least one meetup where we all hug and exchange lurid two wheeled stories.

i'm 19 years old and I'm starting my first job soon. I'm a british citizen, therefore i have a national insurance number. I also have a bank account, and I'm obviously elligible to work in the UK.

I have absolutely no idea what to do once I get paid. My salary per weekly is between 130-150 quid, and, will be paid into my debit account. Does the government just take money from that, or what happens? Do i have specific forms online or printable that I need to fill out? What do I do?

Notes:

1. I live at home with my parents.

2. I am not a student (yet, starting university next year)

Anything else I need to add I can do.

Over the coming 12 months we’ll be running a number of exciting projects looking at various aspects of stuttering, assessing them using brain scans, and trying to improve them with the exciting and totally safe technique of brain stimulation - which just involves placing a couple of sponges on your head really. There are multiple projects so you can choose which you would like to take part in.

All research is paid at around £10 per hour, and some projects will involve multiple sessions so you could earn up to £50 for 4-5 hours of your time. It’s all very simple stuff, it won’t take too much of your time, you’ll be paid a reasonable amount, and it’ll help us to understand more about stuttering and come up with improved ways of handling it.

I'll be running a project or two at the University of Birmingham so you can come by there to take part, or alternatively I may be able to come to you instead. To register your interest in taking part in these exciting and innovative projects, or if you have any questions, please get in touch with me.

I've organised this pretty sweet punk music all dayer at The Chelsea Inn pub in Easton for this Saturday. Thought maybe some people would be interested.

We're starting from 2.30pm with acoustic acts in The Chelsea's garden along with having a vegan bbq, then from 7pm inside the pub is a selection of great and loud punk rock bands.

It's free entry but we ask for donations to help cover the costs of the bands.

The full line up and more details are on the facebook event page if you are interested: https://www.facebook.com/events/741683639291375/

This is more of a general question that I have out of curiosity, rather than a specific problem. 

Wikipedia says: 

&gt;There is currently no freestanding right to privacy at common law.

In the absence of specific privacy legislation or court rulings, how are cases involving breach of privacy prosecuted in criminal and civil courts? A few examples that I can think of: 

* A case where people spy on other and record audio and video and then publish it on the internet. 

* A computer is hacked and private communication is eavesdropped on. 

* A third would be doctors and psychologists divulging medical and therapy records to third parties. 

* Staff of businesses and ordinary people revealing private information of a person.

He thought there was some kind of glamour to the imitation football violence of NYCFC in that viral video that went around on the net, I thought it was entirely pathetic, we had a disagreement, and got into a slanging match, personal insults were exchanged.

Anyway, I got a 7 day ban, and I was of the impression that he hadn't. So I contacted a moderator about the ban.

Here is my contact with the moderator, u/_sic, in full:

http://i62.tinypic.com/2a8qjih.jpg http://i59.tinypic.com/2uh5vrq.jpg

When he ignored me I pm'd him directly:

http://i62.tinypic.com/167qa7k.jpg

The temporary ban should've expired the other day, but I'm still banned.

So I used the contact mod option in the sub, and I've now been given a permanent ban by /u/_sic for ""abuse of a moderator"" according to another mod.

When I responded back with the screenshots of our exchange, I've been ignored entirely.

I've also pm'd /u/_sic directly and apologised, yet have still not received a response.

Is it just me or does anyone else think I've been very harshly dealt with here?

I'd accept it if I felt it was warranted, but I genuinely think the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

When I contacted /u/_sic about the ban I was polite and reasonable, he was rude and dismissive throughout, after he then ignored several of my messages I grew frustrated and described him as a ""caricature mod"" in a final message.

Does that constitute abuse of a moderator, and is it worthy of a permanent ban?

Does anyone know if there's a way I could contest the ban?

Cheers.

Before I say anything, I will say that I intended to have this ready for you on Wednesday at the latest, and preferably on the Tuesday after the game but unfortunately this week my laptop gave out on me, which  obviously has caused a bit of delay. This week I will make shorthand references to last week's post, so a link will be included at the bottom for those who missed that. Anyway, on from me to the game, which while not inspiring was revealing and encouraging in many ways, while offering some causes for concern in other ways.

**First, a few words about football and justice**

One of the things that irked me most while listen to the commentary for this game, and in general with TV commentary and punditry is the constant use of the word 'deserve'. 'Bournemouth can feel like they might have deserved to get points for their efforts', 'Manchester City's win was well deserved', etc. etc. 

The reason for my chagrin at this phrase is due to the fact that the idea of justice (contained within the idea of 'deserving') in football is analytically useless. Football is a game in which chance can always dictate that a goal may seem against the run of play or unjust, and thus undeserved, but in analysing games one has to look at how managers try to stack the odds in their favour, which I feel that we did today. In my opinion good analysis, instead of focusing on mistakes or moments of quality, needs to focus on the mechanics of how managers and teams attempt to give themselves the best chance of winning. Individual incidents like goals or attempts on goal are useful to analyse but as reflective examples of the overall game. The relevant questions for me are not 'who deserved to win', but 'how did each team set about playing', and 'which team gave themselves a better chance of winning'.

*An aside about the refereeing decisions: my interpretation of the relevant rules is that both major decisions were mistaken. Bournemouth's goal should have stood and Liverpool's goal should have been ruled out. However, both incidents occurred at such an early stage in the game that it's impossible to know what the result of the game would have been if the decisions had been correct, and due to that there is not much point in talking about them.* 

*I suspect if the score had been 1-0 from the first 10 minutes this side would have had enough in them to at least draw and had a good chance of winning, but obviously it's tough to say. Frankly supporting the team on the winning side I find it very hard to care, though I will add that I felt the same way about the Sterling offside call in the first half of 13/14 against City. Que sera sera is how I feel about botched refereeing decisions. A matter of chance, like a lot of things in life and football.*

**The Game**

There were decently long periods in which Bournemouth controlled the ball and perhaps the tempo of the game, which intuitively made it feel like they deserved a better result for their efforts. However, the fact that they only created 3 half-chances of any real note could be illustrative of two things:

1. Bournemouth lacking cutting edge in attack
2. Our defensive solidity making it difficult for them to create shooting opportunities

I posted a while ago, got loads of useful information, so I narrowed my options and here I am again hoping to see what you think about these two choices. Still looking for a car to commute (20 miles) everyday and driving around town:
[2009 Hyundai i30 1.4](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/classified/advert/201507095058585?atmobcid=soc3) 
or a [2007 Golf 1.4](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/classified/advert/201508125997141?atmobcid=soc3).

Took both of them for a test drive, can't say a bad word about either! Very smooth, very responsive, drive really well (no noises whatsoever). I am familiar with Golf and loved it so I knew what to expect. Was pleasantly surprised by Hyundai. I would really appreciate your input on how these two compare!

Hyundai seems like a more sensible (financially) option: has better running costs and its insurance and tax are cheaper. Not that much of a difference, but gotta mind the small numbers stacking up at the end of the day. Golfs hold their value really well from what I have heard, so if I happen to exchange it in a year or 2, might be easier to do so with it over the i30. Both have been checked, and both seem to have had a very reasonable and carrying previous owners. 
Last but not least, the golf seller agreed to provide and exchange a new cambelt for free, which is nice, but I also consider calling the i30 owner and suggesting I will buy it, if he agrees to include a new warranty for that price.

Sorry for the long post, but I could really use some advice! Thanks!

I have read in other posts that the NHS average salary scheme still offers a better return than any private investments. Is this true of the teacher's scheme too?

Am I also right in thinking the following is true:

- There is now no defined age of retirement. I.e. It'll probably be linked to the state retirement age which could be well over 70 in 30 years time
- If you want to retire earlier... Every year earlier than this age costs 5% of the total amount accrued? 
- If you die before the state retirement age your spouse can receive half the value of your pension. The other half is lost. 

Edit: Thanks everyone I know other teachers will be searching for this thread and will find the responses useful.

I'm looking for £750 + shipping for the full build without the monitor and £150 for the monitor. The monitor has a couple of stuck pixels (not dead pixels) you can see here http://imgur.com/a/hLFmj but you don't notice them unless you are looking for them.

Everything has been kept in good condition and I have regularly cleaned the computer.

I'm open to offers for individual parts, but I'm unlikely to accept unless I get decent offers for enough of them to justify taking it apart. I still have original boxes for all parts as far as I'm aware.
