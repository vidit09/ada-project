At Porto, Balotelli and Yaya were subjected to sickening chants of (what may or may not have been) ""Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!"" and in the early stages of the Eastlands encounter, the Porto fans unveiled a Scottish flag (that most vile symbol of... what? haggis?) in an utterly bemusing attempt to get a rise out of the City fans.  It would have been too easy for our fans to stoop to Porto's level and chant (what may or may not be) ""Kun! Kun! Kun!"" at Porto's black players, but instead we did what we do best and made a hilarious song aimed at their highly priced, underperforming *superstar*^TM Hulk.  The best fans in the world?  It's not my place to say, but...

### Cutting Edge

In the 2011 portion of this season City won by 2 or more goals in 14 out of 27 games, scoring 4 or more goals on 7 occasions - we were a goalscoring machine!  Compare that with only winning by 2 clear goals twice in 11 games in the new year prior to yesterday.  You could have been forgiven for thinking that City had lost their early-season ability to capitalise on the slightest glimmers of defensive ill-discipline, but in the second leg against Porto, City showed that they can still play a patient game and tear through defensive mistakes.  Could 10 goals in our last 4 games could mark the return of the free-scoring City we all enjoyed so much at the start of the season?

### Back in (Red and) Black

There is no hiding it, our away record hasn't matched our home form, and we've particularly struggled to come from behind.  It isn't an overstatement to say that going on to win from a goal down away to a modern day European powerhouse (and don't let anyone tell you otherwise) is a huge accomplishment.

### Brick Fortress

Early in the season we could score seemingly at will, which is just as well considering how few clean sheets we were keeping.  Our ability to win at home has stood up well over the past year, and we're now finally starting to string clean sheets together.  All hail Joe Hart!

### Is it Silva?  Is it Yaya?  No, it's David Pizarro!

To those of us unacquainted with Serie A benchwarmers, or Chilean national heroes, Pizarro came to City as something of an unknown quantity.  The talk revolved around his ability to build play from deep - all signs pointed to him being our second choice Yaya - but in his brief cameo yesterday, he showed something approaching the deft touch and canny movement that has become David Silva's hallmark.  It would be foolish to throw hyperbole at a late cameo from 32 year-old, 6-month loanee that wasn't getting regular football at Roma, but suffice to say that we got a brief taste of why the Chile adores him.

I was reading the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time#Continuity) on the episode yesterday, and found this:

&gt;One of the two dissident Time Lords, described as ""The Woman"" in the credits, visits Wilfred on several occasions, appearing and disappearing in unexplained ways. When she lowers her arms to stare at the Tenth Doctor he appears to recognise her, but when later asked by Wilfred about her identity, the Doctor evades the question.

Some might say that it's Susan's mother, I suppose. But of course it's meant to be the Doctor's mother.""[10]

So it seems it's supposed to be the Doctor's mother, though RTD was careful not to set this into stone.

I never interpreted 'The Woman' as his mother at the time. I thought it was Donna, in fact, who had taken her place as a Time Lady in the future. Did anyone else think this? It doesn't seem to have occurred to RTD.

If 'The Woman' is his mother, doesn't this have significant reprecusions on continuity. It tells us that he has a mother, and so implies he wasn't born on a loom. It also shows that his mother is a Time Lady, and so he isn't half human on his mother's side as stated in the TV movie.

Though, while writing this, I have thought of a new interpretation. Maybe she is Donna, and Donna is the Doctor's mother.

This really pisses me off as not only does this increase the insanity that is the transfer market, it doesn't help that the current market is inflated beyond any form of recognition. 

But what recently pissed me off is how ""Talksport.com"" claimed that Chelsea was interested in Igor Akinfeev, current keeper at CSKA Moscow, was the subject of interest from the Blues. What pisses me off is that this rumor makes no sense as not only is Petr Cech on a contract till 2017, but also Thibaut has been doing exceptionally well (8 clean sheets in 10 games, even though yeah there is pretty much no really good teams apart from the top 6) and Chelsea have promising youngster Jamal Blackman rising through the ranks and having promise in the youth squad (Sensational comeback again Forest!!) Ok now that was quite a rant on the quality of our keepers. But seriously tha fuck talksport? Tha Fuck? ([link to relevant article](http://goo.gl/0Ukj8))

This is long and not particularly interesting so feel free to not read it. If you have any stories of JCP incompetence and/or apathy though, do share.

Brief backstory: I have been unemployed for the last 6 months which is considerably longer than I was expecting when I left my last job. JCP has made a catalogue of errors during this period which among other things left me with no money whatsoever during December and January.

For the last few weeks I have been going through the recruitment process for an agency who is hiring on behalf of one of the major banks. It's just a call centre job but the pay isn't bad and there seem to be actual career prospects.

Earlier this week I was told I had been successful at interview but they needed a letter from JCP confirming my activities since I left work before they could let me start - the start date being this Monday. I immediately proceeded to the local office where I was met with blank stares. I used their phone to ring the contact centre and the lady on the other end was quite helpful and typed up the letter while I was on the phone and when I explained the urgency she was able to fax it to the local office so I could have it immediately.

The letter had a very small typo; the letter 'k' in my name had been substituted with an 'n'. No big deal I thought, it had my address and NINo on it and the agency have copies of my birth certificate, driving licence and a recent P45. I drove to Manchester (each return trip uses £10 worth of petrol) to deliver it.

Yesterday was my signing day and I told my ""personal advisor"" about my impending employment. She didn't even try to pretend she gave any fucks and just pointed to the number I needed to call to report a change of circumstances. Thanks for the support Carol-without-an-e.

Late this afternoon I got a phone call from the agency saying that because the name on the letter was minutely different, they can't accept it. So I called the enquiry line again and explained the situation and was told ""OK I've put through a request and someone will take a look at it on Monday."" Wait what? That's not what happened last time. ""The only time we're allowed to fax is if you're due to appear in court or about to become homeless."" But... ""hm, I can see we faxed it to the local office last time, are you there now?"" No but I have the fax number of the agency- ""even if I were to bend the rules I'd still only be allowed to fax it to a JCP office."" Ok nevermind, it's only taken me 6 months to find this job so it shouldn't be more than 6 months until the next one. I'll just keep living off benefits until then. Bye.

Anyone who has read this far (so that'll be noone) will probably be wondering why I didn't ask to speak to her manager. The answer is that although I'm quite intelligent I'm also quite slow witted and I tend to only realise the correct thing to say 10 minutes after it would have been useful.

So in conclusion I will not be starting my new job on Monday as I was hoping. There is a six week training course before they let us loose on the customers so I can't just roll up a few days late. I'm hoping they will be taking on another batch of new hires in the near future and I can start with them. If not, well, tough luck right?

Considering a Prospect Magazine/Yougov poll showed 80% of people think that those who have been out of work for 12 months and are physically and mentally capable of working should do something for the community in return for benefits, the fact that virtually no pro-workfare/working for benefits comments gets a score higher than zero must show that most people here are on the dole with no intention of looking for work despite their bleating, whining and protestations. Its the same for any suggestion that someone should set up self employed.

The majority in this subreddit seem to think that what they're going through with this ""recession"" and youth unemployment and workfare is something new and nobody has ever been through it before even though people my age have been through it THREE times now, this time being the worst since the last time 17 years ago which was the worst since the time before that 10 years previously.

In fact in the order of things, for me and people of my age (anyone in their 40's and older) this is actually a piss poor third place event with unemployment needing to rise at least another 20% just to equal the percentage it was in the 80's when there weren't half the benefits there are now and no minimum wage.

They also bleat on about the unaffordability of housing. Well here's some news fuckwits, it was the same for us when we were your age. There was no minimum wage. Mortgage interest rates were well into double figures - reaching 17-18% - so even if you were lucky enough to have a wage that was sufficient to meet the 3.5x earning requirement, you couldn't afford the mortgage repayments anyway. For example, if interest rates today were the same as back then, the monthly repayments on a £100,000 mortgage would be £1400+ compared to the £480 or so they are. How many people on the average wage of £26k taking home £1670 a month would be able to afford a £1400 monthly mortgage payment? Not that they'd take home £1670 because income tax was 30% with only £1585 tax free when I started working.

So shut your fucking whining you set of ungrateful self entitled cunts because you're not badly done by or anything approaching it.

Not to worry. One thing it has done is convince me, a life time labour voter, to vote conservative and call for an end to the minimum wage and tax credits so you really do have something to whine about when you're applying for jobs for £1/hr.

This time, I want to do something different. I want to name the puppy after something I love. Aka, Harry Potter or Doctor Who. I'm just having trouble figuring out and narrowing down the name. We will be getting, hopefully, a little baby girl, all black, with a white spot on her head. Hopefully. We are still working things out with the breeder, so this is tentative, but I want a girl dog.

So I've looked at the London Film Academy, mainly because they had some short length courses. Since I have a degree and have worked in the industry before I'm not going back to school to change careers, but to add to my skills and explore a new place. The main issue is that I'm not sure if this school is worth it, and if not which ones are better to look at. 

I've never been to England so I'm ignorant as to where things are located, and what is a safe and economical way to get from where I would live to school. I also don't have a place to stay, so I need to look into that too.

For those that need a reminder, Sherlock meets with Jim Moriarty on a random rooftop in the midst of London, whereby Moriarty tells Sherlock that he's utterly beaten, and his only choice is to commit suicide. To ensure Sherlock does this, Moriarty tells him, seemingly truthfully, that he's hired several hitmen to kill John Watson, Mrs Hudson and Officer Lestrade. Moriarty then reveals that there is a way out of the situation that doesn't involve Sherlock's death, but shoots himself in the face to ensure Sherlock isn't able to get it out of him. 

The finale seems to show Sherlock talking to John Watson, who is on the street below, confessing to being a fraud before jumping to his death.

The end of the show shows Mrs Harding, his landlady, and John Watson standing over Sherlock's grave. Watson begs Sherlock to ""stop being dead...please"" before walking away, the camera pans round to show...Sherlock, stood there, cool as a penguin's butthole. 

My theory is as follows: Sherlock was never on that roof, John Watson did not speak to Sherlock on the phone and, better yet, he was fully aware of it. It may be possible that Watson was entirely aware of Sherlock's presence at the grave, and his plea was one for Sherlock to stop the act.

There are several clues that point to this.

Firstly, the meeting with Moriarty. Sherlock seems to systematically fail to grasp any aspect of Moriarty's plans, even failing to recognise the uselessness of a simple binary code. Remember that Sherlock keeps his own blog and is a regular user of technology, it is unlikely he's uninitiated in the technological arts, and binary code isn't obscure. At any time he could have tested his theory against any software and found it useless. Sherlock would never voice the theory that the binary code shown to him by Moriarty was anything other than a bluff.

This leads me to add that Moriarty then reveals the rhythm of the code to be that of a piece of classical music. Who else would know classical music well enough to recite it from memory?

The second clue comes in the form of the telephone conversation with John Watson. (Seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaMXCSciAQs&amp;feature=related )
 John Watson states and I quote. ""The first time we met, you knew all about my sister"" and Sherlock claims to have researched him.

There are two vital clues here. Firstly, John Watson has no Sister, secondly, Sherlock never claimed to know anything about any sister. Sherlock knows all about Watson's BROTHER. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im4TYITM0VE

Sherlock would never make such a mistake, Sherlock himself is probably constantly reminded of the existence of Watson's brother simply by Watson's use of the phone which is the key to Sherlock's deduction of his very existence. Sherlock would not make such a mistake.

The third clue comes after the conversation between Sherlock and Watson. Sherlock tosses his phone away. The question here is why would he do that? He has no further use for it if he's going to kill himself, so why? The only possible motive is to protect it from the fall that he is about to incur. Why? It isn't his, why else would he show that respect for it? Sherlock doesn't show respect for anything except the skull that Mrs Hudson took.

Next we have the conversation itself. Sherlock makes a point of apologising, he's teary-eyed and emotional. Except Sherlock has stared death in the face before when John Watson was rigged with the bomb in the swimming pool. Sherlock showed no emotion then.

All this leads me to conclude that the man on the roof is not Sherlock. The person we see jump has none of Sherlock's intelligence, quick-wittedness or stoic nature.

The question then is who?

Well, the person would need to be of roughly the same height and built as Sherlock. Facial features and hair can be adjusted or transplanted through modern surgery, but that would require resources, so the person must also be rich. We know it isn't Watson or Lestrade. It certainly isn't Moriarty, nor is it any of the hitmen.

There is only one possible solution, then. It's Mycroft.

Mycroft is Sherlock's brother, by nature they would have similar builds, heights and weights. Mycroft is a politician and feels immense guilt after outing Sherlock to Moriarty. (A scene that, up until this, seemed pointless. It would have been easier, perhaps even made more sense simply to say that Moriarty knew what he did about Sherlock by using Sherlock's observational techniques, but instead Moffat went with this, there must be a reason for it) putting him in the perfect place to sacrifice for his brother. As a politician he no doubt has the money for plastic surgery or hair transplants, and by borrowing Sherlock's clothes can easily conceal any other differences about them, the voice could be altered simply through impression or again through plastic surgery, it is possible to make one's voice deeper and as a politician he'll have experience speaking sternly to people in the Houses of Parliament.

Therefore, given that Mycroft has none of Sherlock's intelligence, resembles him enough to require minimal adjustment to fool even Moriarty, was not there to notice Watson's deliberate mistake and was feeling guilty for outing his brother to Moriarty in the first place, Sherlock simply convinced him to go up on the roof in his stead.

The question then is why? Well, perhaps Sherlock knew what would be required of him, and death can be a convenient tool for a man disgraced. While Mycroft wouldn't have known, he wouldn't have needed to, and Mycroft wouldn't need the deaths of three people on his hands because of a secondary failure to his only brother.

The fall in question is far too high for Sherlock to have survived, even if he did use the rubber ball trick which seems to be the dominant theory, this theory also does not explain Sherlock's ignorance on the roof, nor his apparant unwillingness to speak too much while up there, nor his sudden emotional torrent to John Watson.

There is one final point too. The closing of that scene shows Sherlock being placed on a stretcher and rushed off by Medics...into what seems to be some kind of alleyway. Also notable is the speed of the medics' arrival. I therefore propose that Sherlock sent them there to wait for the inevitable in the hopes of saving his features after the jump (which they evidently did given his scar-free appearance in the closing seconds)

This is the only theory I have that accounts for all of the following:

Sherlock's emotional instability
Sherlock's ignorance
Sherlock's failure to spot Watson's deliberate mistake.
The fact that Watson was conveniently placed for the final show.
The fact that Mycroft's guilt was shown in such a way.
The fact that Watson does indeed seem to pronounce him dead at the scene.
The fact that Sherlock must, by definition, have outsmarted Moriarty.

The first 45 was a case of attack against defence with City looking to break through the wall of Rovers players, it was almost a dream start for the home side as Johnson broke free and squared to Balotelli who's 12 yard effort was superbly saved by Robinson (2).



Vincent Kompany almost claimed the first goal with a sublime flick from a corner, reminiscent of his manager's playing days, but a great stop from Robinson denied City the lead. It took until the half hour mark to break the deadlock when a typical Kolarov cross found Balotelli in the box who supplied the finish from 6 yards to finally beat Paul Robinson. The lead nearly doubled in first half stoppage time when Balotelli played an excellent long ball to Aguero who dragged his shot just wide.



The second half started in similar fashion to the first with Blackburn very much on the back foot, City's lead was doubled on 52 minutes when a Kolarov corner was punched out by Robinson, only to fall to Aguero who drilled it home from 10 yards out. Blackburn offered little going forwards but it took City until the introduction of Edin Dzeko to add a third as his second touch of the game was a well met header that flew into the corner of Robinson's goal just minutes after he replaced Mario Balotelli (81).

I'm in a bit of a sticky situation when it comes to tax, one that I'd like to rectify, however I'm scared that if I picked up the phone and spill to the tax office, I'm liable to get fined heavily.

Basically I was PAYE until around age 23, and since then been doing various bits of contract work, sometimes through PAYE with an umbrella company, other times invoicing directly (paid into my current account), and more recently, as PAYE through an umbrella that pays the majority of my salary through some other means.

Although I'm assured by the current company that I'd pass an audit, the real problem lies in 2010, where I received upwards of 30k into my personal account, and have never paid tax on it.

This is the situation I'd like to fix. I've never filed a return either. In fact I don't even know how. Has anyone dealt with this kind of thing before? What was your experience? Should I just come clean?

Assuming I owe 5-10k+ in unpaid tax, is it possible to pay it off over time? I don't have that much money!

Certainly, unionists cannot hope to return
to an Ulster of old, securely British in all manifestations of state
culture. The Troubles have locked Northern Ireland irreversibly
into an Irish paradigm. Institutional recognition of this, in all-
Ireland bodies, is likely to be permanent. Nor can nationalists have
faith that Ireland will become ‘Gaelic and free’, shunning its
community with Great Britain. The principle that only Northern
Ireland can consent to fundamental constitutional change is more
firmly enshrined now than when the violence began.

That violence was almost completely pointless seems clear, but it is
likely that reference to war will colour and shape politics for long to
come. This memory may infect a new generation with ready-made
traditions of war, but equally old soldiers can drive their energies,
with more effect, into peaceful politics. The echo of bombs and
bullets must remain preferable to their bloody immediacy.

The potential exists now in Northern Ireland for an experiment
important in the wider world. Can two identities and national
allegiances be accommodated in the same state without oppression,
rebellion, or violence? That divergent identities exist can hardly be
doubted, but the test is whether these can be institutionally
recognized to the satisfaction of both. Further, if Northern Ireland
is to escape the debilitating tension of continuous communal competition, space must be allowed for the development of a
politics and society no longer polarized between Protestant and
Catholic.

This is no easy task, and the evidence suggests that politicians at
least see a continuing need to rally and manoeuvre in a neverending
struggle to preserve and favour their respective traditions.
In a developing climate of peace and cooperation, however, it may
be hoped that for most citizens of Northern Ireland the clash of
ideology, while not irrelevant to their lives, will become a
background hum to each individual’s day-to-day life. A sense of
identity can liberate as well as bind; strong allegiances can provide
secure jumping points for the investigation of other cultures,
histories, and ways of life. It is to be hoped that Northern Ireland
will grow not only in prosperity, but also in self-confidence. In the
future, though not for some time, it may yet become a beacon for
culture and pluralism.

Beardy Stroky methinks.  His Wife maybe?  And Old River song?  Or maybe a different one, his original wife etc? (I don't know all the back stories, but would love if they included this, sign of respect and all that) 

Whoever it was, she was sent back into the time war, which was described by the Doctor as a literal Hell (Nightmare Childs and such).  His wife witnessed so many unbearable horrors that she turned to stone.  And now spreads havoc wherever she roams

I would love to see an origin story of the Weeping Angels.  And wonder if this was entered in by Moffat as part of a long term plan.

It hit an iceberg, that wasn't Belfast's fault. It was still a world-class piece of engineering. I'm talking about the company that made it (Harland and Wolff) and their controversial history of discrimination in employment. 

&gt; Allegations of discrimination in employment, like those in housing go back to the first days of the Stormont regime and before. Catholic workers had been violently expelled from the Belfast shipyards several times during the nineteenth century. Those Catholics who had obtained jobs in engineering while Protestants were fighting in the 1914-18 war, were expelled from the Harland and Wolff shipyard and other large engineering firms during the 1920 sectarian unrest which preceded partition.

[B. Bardon, A History of Ulster, Blackstaff press, Belfast, 1992] 




&gt; The main allegations of discrimination within the private sector were focused on the major engineering companies in Belfast. These companies, the Harland and Wolff shipyard, the Shorts aircraft factories, and Mackies textile machinery works employed relatively few Catholics despite the proximity of Catholic residential areas. Although more than one thousand Catholics worked in these companies at the end of the Stormont period there can be little doubt that Catholics had, and continued to have, strong difficulties in getting and keeping jobs in these firms. Paddy Devlin, in his autobiography Straight Left, describes how as a young man in the 1930s he obtained a job at Mackies where his fellow workers threw nuts and bolts as well as abuse at him, and he left after a few days and there is little reason to think that these conditions had fully disappeared by the 1960s.

[42. P. Devlin, Straight Left: An Autobiography, Blackstaff Press, Belfast, 1993.] 

Given the history of discrimination in the making of the ship, it can hardly be described as a good example of the cross-community legacy of Belfast. It's absolutely part of the Protestant/Unionist legacy and a controversial one at that given the widespread discriminationary practices of Harland and Wolff during the time of the ship's construction.

just got back from a night out and me and my friends were attacked by about 20 - 17/18 year olds who decided that me ringing the police deserved a full sucker punch to the nose. (Its going to hurt in the morning) 

The police arrived about 5 minutes after I had rang and been punched due to the fact that 'cuts' in the forces meant that they were 'very short staffed'. (I genuinely felt sorry for the police officer who delt with most of it.) 

After recent discussions about the UK 'riots' etc and now this I'm wondering whether my attitude may be shifting - Because when I was 17/18 I sure as hell wasn't out to beat someone to a pulp.

I only caught the second half (slept through my alarm), but some of the things I saw included:

* Even with two holding midfielders (Parker and Sandro) Arsenal (especially Rosicky) was able to completely overrun the midfield
* For all his positional strength, King was frustrating slow when Arsenal was on the counter attack
* Bale was completely nonexistent (except for what, from all the reactions, seems to have been a clear dive), and the same could be said for Van der Vaart
* Adebayor hardly seemed to care what was happening (why was Saha the one taken off?)
* I don't think I saw a Tottenham player get a single header off of any of a number of corners

Lastly, while I don't know how much it actually means, Arsenal seemed to ""want"" the game significantly more - they got to the ball first, they got up higher for the headers, etc. Spurs capitulation came pathetically early.

Just a really frustrating game (well, half) to watch all around, and with a very tough game coming up next week and Man Utd (which Parker is now unavailable for) Arsenal and Chelsea could very well be only 4 points back.

Two men in Luton who raped an 11-year-old girl have been sentenced to just 40 months despite guidelines recommending a sentence between 8 - 13 years for those convicted of raping a child. The reason for this lenient sentence was the judge's assertion that the girl looked older than her age. He also claimed that she was a ""willing"" participant in her own rape.

Roshane Channer and Ruben Monteiro attacked the girl and even filmed the ordeal. In this situation, a young girl being approached by two adult men is very likely to face emotional manipulation, intimidation and to be coerced. Even if a minor wishes to be or is sexually active, that does not excuse an adult's abuse or exploitation. A child, no matter how knowledgeable they believe themselves to be in such matters, will not have the emotional maturity, confidence or judgement to fully consent.

Judge David Farrell QC excused the rapists by focusing and proportioning blame onto the child. Victim-blaming in rape cases is sadly pervasive in our culture so it is therefore important that those with judicial power understand the severity of rape, especially when the victim is a minor. No matter what age she looked, no matter how ""willing"" she appeared, she was still a child in a vulnerable position. The law that was supposed to protect her has failed her. Please sign and show your support.

""Despite her age it is accepted that she was a willing participant, but the law is there to protect young girls from this type of behaviour and [...] from themselves."" - Judge David Farrell, suggesting a child can simultaneously be a rape victim and a willing participant.

But how many of us remember Arsenal fans cheering like they'd won a cup final when going into half time at 2-2 against us? 

I haven't seen any Spurs fans saying that today's loss means we don't have a shot at the title. There's a post in [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) with hundreds of upvotes that suggests today somehow decided that.

Arsenal winning today means that they brought the gap between us and them *down from double digits*. So who has the bragging rights?

Sure, we went into this game supremely confident and got what we deserved. But so many things surrounding the build-up, the match itself, and the aftermath suggest that the tide is indeed changing. It's not something that's decided in one match, but a gradual shift. This was Arsenal's first win over us since 2009. They have won, what?, 2 out of the last 9 against us.

##My views on the Arsenal fans

I'm sorry for the club and most of their players, but I want their racist ~~fucking~~ supporters to see their club get relegated into the oblivion so that the only way they can gain some respect is in the sixth division on Greenland. Apparently Arsenal has moved their stadium before, they can do it again.

I'm all for the friendly banter, maybe that should coexist in the sport, but those racist ~~fucks~~ people that has been swarming [/r/COYS](/r/COYS) today should never have the joy of success. I may be the only one, but I think you're less than an Aphodiinae bug if you're a racist.

It all began during the 2006 World Cup in Germany when Steven Gerrard scored his goal against Trinidad and Tobago.
Before then I hadn't really paid much attention to football. I lived in Lebanon at the time so I played it with my friends on the street, but I always saw it as a fun game to play but didn't really pay attention to the big names and glamour on TV. It wasn't until Gerrard had scored his amazing goal that I decided to look a little deeper and discovered the club that was Liverpool. The next season I decided to tune into one of the matches to see what the Premier League was all about and looking to catch a glimpse of the man that played for England, except in a Red shirt. It was the game against Newcastle during the 2007 season in which Alonso scored his amazing chip from the halfway line. It was a novel experience for me, to be frustrated every time the ball went wide of the goal or to feel a certain anxiety when the other team is attacking your goal. Once Alonso scored his goal, I was sold. I would forever support Liverpool from that moment onward.
After that, Liverpool kept going on the ascendancy with Benitez. We got to the Champion's League final at Athens. The next summer we signed Fernando Torres. I remember leaping in the air for joy when I heard the news, I was desperate to acquire a pair of T90s like his, as if my obsession with his shoes would empower me with his talents as well.
Then things started to go darkly in my life. My father became more and more abusive toward my mother and in the end we decided to flee from Lebanon and run away back to North America. My mother couldn't support me at the time so she sent me to live with her sister in Wisconsin while she went to a homeless shelter in Canada. I was an American citizen (born in Denver) but she didn't have the green card so she had to live in Canada for a bit. At the time, Liverpool were cruising through Champion's League, and I was sure we were going to make it to Moscow in 2008, but Chelsea ended that run. After that, Liverpool began its slump when we got our 82 points but failed to win the title.
I have supported Liverpool for six years now. It has always been a constant connection for me through the toughest parts of life. When my parents split and I was forced into an entirely different life from the life I had, the endeavors of the team and the connection between the team and the fans helped me keep going. I felt like I was truly a part of the family, even though I was so many thousand miles away, waking up at the crack of dawn to watch a lagging stream in a fake jersey. I've been there during the good times: When we won at the Camp Nou, when Gerrard scored his 100th goal, when we beat Arsenal 4-2 in the CL quarter final, when we beat Chelsea in the semifinal, when Torres scored his beauty against Blackburn, and when we beat Besiktas 8-0. I've been there during the worst of times as well, when the dark cloud of H&amp;G hung over the club, when Rafa left, when Torres left, when we failed to qualify for Europe, when Forlan knocked us out at the death after Benayoun had scored in the semifinal of the Europa League.
I guess what I am trying to say here, after this massive wall of text is Liverpool has always meant so much more to me than just a football team that I occasionally watch. It's become an identity, a passion and a love that is on another level than anything I could have with anyone. It's a love that will always be there, no matter who is in my life or out of it. I am going through a rough breakup at the moment and for the club to rise from the ashes and finally bring a trophy home... it meant a lot.
It's been six years. This trophy, no matter how much of a ""mickey mouse trophy"" it is, is the first trophy I've seen the team win during those six years and I cried and cried when Gerrard lifted the trophy up.

**I'm looking for:** PC technician, network administrator and web design positions, but also interested in any other work that may be available. This includes physical labour as well.

**My experience:** I have a Masters Degree in IT featuring an excellent study record at a renowned Slovakian university. Unfortunately, being a fresh graduate I have no previous work contracts, but have had many side works and projects and can show references if requested.

**My skills** I am skilled in PC hardware troubleshooting and assembly, managing and building Windows based TCP/IP networks, MS Office, PHP, CSS, HTML and Photoshop.

**About me:** I have arrived recently to London and I am looking for any work available. My goal is to find a friendly and fun working environment in the United Kingdom where I can further my knowledge and experience in IT, however, I would be happy with other offers outside IT just as well. 

**How to contact me:** Please send me an email to *mail.ladislav.molnar* **AT** *gmail* **DOT** *com* and I will send you my detailed CV.

I ask because I really love our flat and neighborhood and don't want to move. Like most people, we could never afford to buy in London. All the literature I've read so far points to ""yes"" - by the stated definition of a ""secure tenant"" we fit the bill.

The Doctor is clearly attracted to women, and there has been some gay jokes thrown in here and there, but either way he's either hetero- or bisexual.

In either case it seems very unfortunate if we imagine a heterosexual time lord couple (For example) and all of a sudden one of them changes into a new body of the same gender as their spouse. This could ruin a relationship as one (Or possible both, if sexuality changes with the gender) of them would not be attracted to his/her mate anymore. Also, if we're going to get biological, it could reduce the chances of children. Now, obviously, a time lord couple where both (Or all, depending on how open minded they are) are of the same gender wont produce children either, but they can ofcourse wait until one of them changes into the opposite gender if they are still in love with their partner.

So when the Tenth Doctor first met River, it was the last time she'd ever see him. And she was at the oldest age he could see her, and he was at the youngest age she could see him. Right?
But then in season 6, the Doctor, Amy, and Rory all see River as a newborn baby, the youngest age she would be. But then later in the season they see her before she regenerates, and in the season finale they see her regenerated self. So, now I'm confused. 
Shouldn't the episode where River is a baby, be the last time we see her, if they are meeting each other at opposite points in their life. But then how do we see her as a young adult in a later episode, and then even older in another episode? They seem to be meeting more chronologically now. 
I was just wondering if I missed something, or didn't understand a part correctly that you fellow Whovians could help me out with. 
Or maybe Moffat made a mistake.
Or wibbly wobbly timey wimey?

The one who witnessed the Ninth and his glory,

Blonde hair and eyes that pierced through his soul,

For a price of putting her family in danger

She stood her ground, but never thought she was special, 

Donna Noble, was saved and ceased to remember.

She had a fire in her heart and on her head,
 
Amelia Pond, was the girl who waited.

Seeking companions, calling it a curse.

The very basis of the NHS is under attack.
I read this article in the Daily Telepgraph,

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9106880/Read-this-and-prepare-to-fight-for-your-NHS.html

This is not a political statement. This is about protecting an institution we will all at some point come to rely on. 

The NHS care provision in the UK is about to be forced to compete with third party providers, while third party providers do provide care they also must make a profit for their shareholders and owners. The National Health Service does not run as a profit making enterprise and we all benefit from this basis. 

If the NHS state system is in competition with private companies, this will take money out of the National Health System and starve it of funds, this is analogous to the Walmart model, go into a town, use your purchasing power to undercut the competition and when they are out of the way and have gone out of business raise the cost. The National Health Service Hospital cannot compete for private health care in the same way. This is a form of privatisation of the Health Service. A system that is one of the most cost effective in the world, it does not need to change.

The legislation is now a complete mess. 
 
This legislation is not about improving the NHS it is about handing our taxpayers money over to private companies who run their businesses for a profit, Much of the the medical industry are against it, but they need your support. So if you want the same system that you have been used to and that works so well this is what is what I suggest you do, go to 

http://www.theyworkforyou.com/

Look up your MP by your postcode
Choose ""Send a message to your MP""

Please copy the following template message in to the  message

Dear [**Insert MPs name here**],

I do not wish for Private Enterprise to compete with any part of the National Health Service, I believe in the long term this will lead to the detriment of the service.

If I find that you have supported this bill  I will not not vote for you in the next election, and you will not be welcome on our streets, your political career as far as I am concerned is completely finished.

The NHS is an institution that I suppport, if you hand this over to private enterprise I will not vote for you again. 

Yours sincereley,
[**Insert Your Name Here**]

replacing  

[**Insert MPs name here**] with your MP's name.
and 

[**Insert Your Name Here**] with your name

This is will take 2 minutes of your time, it is not much but if we show enough support we may be able to save to save the fairest medical system from future chaos. If you support the concept of the NHS then please make this small effort. It may help prompt your MP into going against political dogma and actually support your needs. 

This is very urgent. 
We must fight for our NHS and we must do this so now.

Thanks very much for your time.

1) There is **no public bathroom**, instead you are asked to use the bathroom at M&amp;S down the road. While this is only a minor inconvenience for me, I find it absolutely unacceptable for a library. What about senior citizens or people with limited mobility? 

2) The recently introduced wireless **internet access** is a joke. In the unlikely event that one manages a to obtain a connection, one is awarded three one hour slots to use for the day, with enforced 15 minute breaks between them. 

Important websites for study and work such as dropbox.com are blocked. How can any self-respecting library provide such terrible internet service. As a centre for public learning, isn't usable internet access a necessity? If I have better access to information in my local Starbucks than in my local library, something is wrong.

A library should be a service to the public, instead I'm made to feel that I'm just about tolerated here if I don't break any rules. As an example, one is allowed to bring water bottles into the library, yet today I was approached and asked to put away my water bottle *because it was transparent green*. 

As it turns out, enjoyment of your allowed bottle of water is subject to the proper colouring of the bottle. The reason is that one could put alcoholic drinks in a green bottle. I was quietly working away at my laptop when this happened. The fact that there was clearly water in the bottle was deemed irrelevant, I had to put the bottle away.

Anyway, I realise this is a bit of a personal rant, but isn't anybody else annoyed with the library? Am I expecting too much? 

Is it worth sending a formal complaint somewhere? Where would this need to go?",false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,null,null,default,Is it just me or is Oxford's public library terrible?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/oxford/comments/q9s69/is_it_just_me_or_is_oxfords_public_library/

Skip to 111:21 for the evidence given by Jacqui Hames.

Edited to provide information for those unfamiliar with the significance of the evidence given and added some information relating to the death of Daniel Morgan:

Edit 2: IAA pick up on the story
http://iaaglobal.net/default.aspx?id=71ad0a8e-bf0d-4ea3-84ac-c43a4ba72082

&gt;She and her then husband, senior police officer David Cook, were placed under surveillance by the paper after he was put in charge of a 2002 appeal for information regarding the murder of Daniel Morgan. Morgan was found dead in the car park of a pub in south London in 1987. He had been hit in the head with an axe. 

&gt;Private investigator Jonathan Rees, who allegedly earned £150,000 a year from the News of the World for supplying illegally obtained information, was cleared of Morgan's murder last March.

&gt;According to the witness statements Hames submitted to the inquiry, shortly after the new 2002 appeal, which was broadcast on Crimewatch, the police were told that one of the suspects intended to make life difficult for Cook, and the BBC1 programme received an email suggesting she was having an affair with a senior police detective.

&gt;The couple subsequently found themselves under surveillance by News International. Two vans parked outside their house were traced back to the News of the World causing them ""great anxiety"", said Hames.

Background to Jacqui Hames, as taken from the transcript of the evidence:

http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Witness-Statement-of-Jacqueline-Hames.pdf

&gt;I am a former Metropolitan Police officer and Crimewatch presenter. I joined
the Metropolitan Police Service (’MPS’) in 1977 at the age of 18 and became
a Detective Constable, serving until January 2008 when I took early
retirement. I am best known for my role as a presenter on BBC Crimewatch
between 1990 and 2006 as a result of which I have first hand experience of the
way in which the press and the police interact, gained from working on both
sides

Taken from paragraph 39 of the transcript,

&gt;The explanation supplied by the News of the World for
placing David and I under surveillance was that they were investigating
suspicions that we were having an affair with each other. This was utterly
nonsensical as we had by then been married for four years, had been together
for 11 years and had two children.

Taken from the transcript, paragraph 40

&gt;The News of the World has never supplied a coherent explanation for why we were placed under surveillance. Ill 2003, David, together with Dick Fedorcio and Commander Andre Baker, met Rebekah Brooks to discuss the matter. She repeated the unconvincing explanation that the News of the World believed we were having an affair. She agreed to look into Alex Marunchak’s associations with Rees and Fillery but to my knowledge nothing further was ever said about the subject, indeed Mr Marunchak was subsequently promoted. 

&gt;I believe that the real reason for the News of the World placing us under surveillance was that suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to try to intimidate us and so attempt to subvert the investigation. These events left me distressed, anxious and needing counselling and contributed to the break-down of my marriage to David in 2010. Given the impact of these events, I would like to know why the police did not investigate why we came to be placed under surveillance by a newspaper like this.

Information on Daniel Morgan:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morgan_%28private_investigator%29

Nick Davies piece on the News of the World, Met Police and Daniel Morgan:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/06/news-of-the-world-rebekah-brooks?INTCMP=SRCH

&gt;Brooks was summoned to a meeting at Scotland Yard where she was told that one of her most senior journalists, Alex Marunchak, had apparently agreed to use photographers and vans leased to the paper to run surveillance on behalf of Jonathan Rees and Sid Fillery, two private investigators who were suspected of murdering another investigator, Daniel Morgan, when the latter was a partner of Rees's in the firm Southern Investigations. The Yard saw this as a possible attempt to pervert the course of justice.

&gt;Brooks was also told of evidence that Marunchak had a corrupt relationship with Rees, who had been earning up to £150,000 a year selling confidential data to the News of the World. Police told her that a former employee of Rees had given them a statement alleging that some of these payments were diverted to Marunchak, who had been able to pay off his credit card and pay his child's private school fees.

Edit 3: Tom Watson gets adjournment debate in parliament for tomorrow http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/speakers-office/wadjourns/

&gt;4:00 pm  - 4:30 pm  Mr Tom Watson, Death of Daniel Morgan



Edit 4: In the week prior to his death, Daniel Morgan said he was going to take a story (to a newspaper) which would expose police corruption http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0138xmp/The_Report_Hacking_Scandal/



Edit 5: BBC report on Tom Watson's call for a judicial inquiry into death of Daniel Morgan
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17201982

plus, some reports from the adjournment debate that the govt is open to this happening. Will update.


Edit 6: Can't find any direct confirmation of govt agreeing (or states a position to being open) to a judicial inquiry, however

http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/tom-watson-calls-for-release-of-report-linking-notw-journalist-with-police-payments/s2/a548117/

&gt;The Labour MP used a private members debate to call for the release of the 2002 report, which Watson said contains allegations that Alex Marunchak was heard discussing payment to Cambridgeshire police for information about the investigation into the murder of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.He said he was unsure as to whether the allegations he believes are contained in the report were true, but called for the document to be released. Watson also spoke of alleged links between Marunchak and a suspect in the unsolved murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, who was reportedly about to reveal police corruption when he was killed 25 years ago.

&gt;A far worse example involved The Doctor locked for eternity in a prison specifically designed to hold him. **After he got out, he went back in time and let himself out. How he got out the first time is never explained.** Well, specifically what happened at the end of that episode (""The Pandorica Opens"") is that the Doctor is locked in the Pandorica for all of eternity, an android Rory kills Amy, River gets stuck in the TARDIS which explodes, and the entire universe ceases to exist. Five minutes into the second part (""The Big Bang""), the earth still somehow exists, Amy is shown to be very much alive, and the Doctor is released from the Pandorica via his Sonic Screwdriver from the future. Ten minutes into the episode, River is rescued from the explosion. All thanks to a ""Vortex Manipulator"". (The rest of the episode deals with how to get the rest of the universe back.)

Tvtropes.org

I thought tvtropes explained my question very well. Even with all the timey wimey stuff/technobabble, there has to be a ""first"" time where the doctor got out of the pandorica. We just have seen the one where he got the screwdriver from his future self in the 
""universe-rescued"" scenario, but in my understanding of timetravel, there has to be a second scenario where he first got out. Maybe in that scenario it was to late to save everyone, so he traveled back to establish a timeline where everything will be fine. Nevertheless, it wouldn't work in that way we've seen on TV.

I am technically British (my parents did their PhDs here and naturalized) but I have never set foot on the island proper in my entire life. I was born in HK and went to the US for college when i was 17. I don't mind starting low, mopping floor or cleaning toilets; living in a slum or eating baked beans all day, but my eventual goal is to get enough relevant working experience here in order to apply to the best International Relations schools. An added bonus would be the discounted tuition at LSE or Oxbridge once I have spent two years in the UK.

My minds are pretty much set, as I really dislike everything about Hong Kong - the people, the atmosphere and the lack of international career opportunities, political and intellectual freedom there - my reason to make this post is just to ask for some advices from you guys so as to make my transition easier.

In other words, I want to know what happened in every moment of the character's history, just for the sake of knowing.

I had a question of how the 7th, 8th, and 9th doctors transition from one into another, and a general question regarding ""the Moment.""  I haven't seen it yet, but according to the Doctor Who wiki, the 7th regenerated into the 8th at the beginning of the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie.  Then he went off on an adventure and left popular media for a while, appearing as the Doctor Who comic/magazine.

Now.  In terms of the Doctor's own personal timeline, is it correct in thinking that the 8th Doctor uses the Moment, time-locks Gallifrey and dooms his people, and then (for some reason I don't quite know), regenerates into the 9th Doctor and instantly meets Rose?  

What happens with ""the Moment"" and how soon after did he start meeting his companions in the modern series?

I just started watching this show after hearing so much good about it. I watched the first 5 episodes of the first ""new"" season (Eccleston). There are some questions I have that Google couldn't help me clear up so far, so now I turn to you.

What really dislike is that there hasn't been a mention of how time travel works in the ""Who-Universe"". When there are sudden problems/threats, why does the Doctor not just travel to a point before everything gets messy and deals with it then. For example in the episode with the Slitheen (unsure about spelling) that take over the british government by killing all the important persons to start a nuclear war. After they survived it all, why not just go back to shortly before the ""crash landing"", tell the prime minister what is going to happen, thereby saving everyone? 

Why does Rose have to leave her mother and boyfriend behind, when she could just visit every few weeks at a moment that would be a day after she left them?

Can there be more than one Version of yourself at one point in time? 

How can they visit different times when they undertake actions that would change how things turn out? For example, the Doctor showed Rose the end of the Earth, a point in time where all humans have left the planet and gone on to other projects. Then humankind is barely saved from extinction in the next episode, saved by the Doctor and Rose. There was no chance of failure because they already know humans will get to the point of space traveling at some point.

So many more questions, but to keep this thread to a point I'll leave it at this.

It really bothers me that this is not addressed at all, when it would be one of the first question anyone would ask in Rose's place. 

Hopefully you can help me out because the concept makes for a very intriguing show. It just doesn't go deep enough for me at the moment. Will this get better? At this point all questions a viewer may have go unanswered, are ignored. 

Thanks to everyone that takes the time to answer.

[here it is](http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/whithouse-hints-at-series-7-episode-31161.htm).

In particular, I'm intrigued by his line that ""no one has written in that genre for quite a while now."" Any ideas on what this could be? Assuming that he means for *Doctor Who* and not just in general, my first thought was that they're bringing back the historical episodes. Not just going back in time and meeting famous people and aliens, but actually going to experience a particular time and place, no aliens necessary. I'm working my way through the First Doctor's work, and am thinking perhaps something in the vein of *Marco Polo* or *The Aztecs*, two of the best episodes from the first season and definitely not the sort of thing they do on the show anymore.

My next thought is that with the [rumor that the Yeti will appear](http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/rumoured-returning-monster-for-series-7-29858.htm), perhaps the genre that Whithouse is referring to is, for lack of a better term, crytopzoological? Again, we've had movements towards that genre with episodes like Whithouse's last one, *The God Complex*, but an episode with an honest-to-goodness let's-go-meet-an-urban-legend plot.

Question.

Why did the TARDIS go to the end of the universe? The Doctor said that Jack was an impossible thing and that the TARDIS went to the end of the universe to try and get rid of him.

But now I'm wondering if it went there because Captain Jack had something to track a time lord so when he jumped on the TARDIS that caused it to trace the Master and travel to where he is.

1. He says ""Perhaps I can save you some time.  That is most definitely the Doctor, and he is definitely dead.""  CED doesn't seem like the kind of fellow to jump to conclusions, especially when he has personally seen just how tricky the Doctor can be.  This makes me think he was in on the tricky part.

2. When River asks him why he is there, he says ""The same reason as you.""  This could very well be a subtle hint that he also knows what River knows about what is really going on.

3. Canton never really spent that much time with the Doctor, yet he was invited to an event and trusted with very important knowledge.  This implies a greater connection than what we have seen so far.

Based on this, I think Canton Everett Delaware III may show up prominently next season, maybe even as a Companion.  

In all fairness, there may be some wishful thinking going on there.  Canton was awesome, and I'd love to see more of him.

However at least the 70's Episodes with Tom Baker, John Pertwee were watchable to a degree. I was more in to Space 1999 and Star Trek as a kid because I guess even then I preferred my sci if with a little bit of good science theory/

When the new series launched in 2005 I was looking forward to watching it. I had presumed that because of the heavy competition such as the Star Trek trilogies the new Dr Who would at the very least be science interesting. I knew the budgets wouldn't be on the level of the US sci if shows so surely the makers would rely heavily on the script and the strong acting

How wrong was I..

From the very first second of the very first episode I had a bad feeling. A few episodes later and all my worst fears and then some had come true. Cheap, nasty, bad acting, amateur script, and in jokes that were embarrassingly bad.

From time to time I would catch an episode hoping that things had improved. It hadn't.

Now fast forward to April 2008 and the latest series. I watched the first two episodes and honestly couldn't believe how bad this programme is or had become. The latest script and acting are so appalling everyone involved in making this rubbish should be ashamed that they are taking British licence fee payers money. Its such a disgrace I believe the BBC should issue a public apology and refund everyone in the UK a portion of their TV tax back. The political correct obsessed BBC scriptwriters are in full PC mode and as usual within ten minutes the first gay sub tone is directed at the viewers. yes, we know its so cool to be gay. They have a new sidekick for the doctor. I cant remember her name and don't care, but she is the worst one yet. Her ""Im one of the lads"" attitude is in your face constantly and you had better believe within a few episodes she will be running around with a pint of lager in her hand in every episode. Also mark my words, this sidekick will save the Doctor and the Universe on her own much more than all the others put together quite simply because shes a woman and we need it rammed down our throats constantly that women can do anything better than any man, especially in Britain. The show is so dumbed down I believe the target audience are Embryos, but even then thats is an insult to that particular group. There's so much wrong with this TV show its incredibly difficult to say exactly what it is except for everything is wrong with it.

Anyways, onto my question:  Me and a friend (I'm American, she's an American living on a U.S. Air Force base in Britain) are going to be in Snowdonia for a week and a half in April/May, and I had a few questions about what would be alright to do and what would get me in a lot of trouble.

We had plans to basically hike around Snowdonia for a week or two, throwing down a tent at night and then picking it up in the morning and moving along.  Are permits required to do this in Snowdonia, or are there any kinds of rules/regulations I should know before hand?

How ""wild"" is the area?  In most of the places I camp (bear country), you have to hang your food 20-30 feet off the ground by a tree in order to avoid bears, squirrels, wolves, foxes, raccoons, etc., getting into it and eating it.  Would I have to figure out a way to protect my food, or are the animals I need to be worried about not going to be able to eat through my pack?

What's the climate like that time of the year?  From my research it looks pretty mild/warm (10-15c), and I assume pretty rainy.

Thanks for any help you can provide.  Also, are there any possibly more active subreddits that would know about this area (aside from the giant ones, of course)?",false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,null,null,self,Trekking/ Wild Camping/ Backpacking in Snowdonia,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wales/comments/qcwc8/trekking_wild_camping_backpacking_in_snowdonia/

This nurse (who must remain anonymous) Started their career over 30 years ago, and has been in many roles including Midwife, and General Practice. They are now a Head Nurse in General Practice. This nurse is not me, nor are they related to me, but they are a good friend.

On this subreddit I do often play devil's advocate to try and get the best reasons and opinions out of people, but I am AGAINST reform. This nurse defeats me every time in argument!

I just wanted to let you all know that this AMA is primarily for fun, interest and hearing the opinions from someone on the other side of the table from us. Please expect a lot of anecdotal evidence based on this nurse's *personal experiences*. Don't believe it? that's fine, nobody is asking you to.

I was busy getting my papers in order and not really paying attention to their conversation when one suddenly called my name and asked me which doctor was my favorite.

Without thinking, or even looking up, I answered ""ten."" There was a moment of silence, then the student asked ""What class does Dr. Ten teach?""

I've really gotten back into the show now that I've figured out new ways to watch the episodes much easier than before (especially with the Eleventh Doctor) and have truly come to love how the show is now and it's a bit hard to imagine the show without Amy &amp; Rory.

All Time Lords have 12 regenerations and at this time the Doctor has used technically 11 of them. Although he is on his 11th incarnations, the 10th used one regeneration and avoided changing by channeling some of the energy to his severed hand. When River revived the Doctor and used up her remaining regenerations it creates some questions. My theory though is that the energy was used up reviving the Doctor from a certain death.

If taking this into account the Doctor can only regenerate one more time naturally. As we all know there are other ways to bring him back that can be found in the new series. I'm not sure if the resurrection the Master's cult preformed is the same one the Time Lords used to bring the Master and Rassilon back to fight in the Time War. So there could be two possible ways to resurrect the Doctor. Another way they could give him more regenerations that I read somewhere is [spoilers] (/s ""the harvesting of a massive power to give him more regeneration energy.

I live in an apartment block. Clearly being the f**king idiot I am I left our door unlocked!!! So 3 guys got into our flat. 
What would you do if you got into someone flat?!

What a normal ""burglar"" would do: Steal valuable shit.

What these guys did: Put a lightbulb in my microwave and bleach in my flatmates goldfish and stole...wait for it...a book on how to be Agnostic! :O :O

I realise that I am SO LUCKY. The microwave didn't catch fire (I wouldn't have heard the fire alarm if it had!). My handbag, camera, ipod, purse and laptop were sitting right beside the goldfish. 

Next time lads...take the £7 out of my purse and leave the goldfishy alone!!!! :(

So...no sleep for me tonight. Maybe once the sickly smell of melted lightbulb, bleach and dead fish has dispersed. B*ST*RDS! 

And yes...I realise I am an idiot. It's a running joke with my flatmate that I always have the door double locked at all times and one time it was single locked and that is how we knew our landlord had been in.

About a year ago a very well written fan story surrounding a crossover between Doctor Who and the Slenderman mythos was put out on 4chan over on /x/ and was later archived. For those that have not read this it's an incredibly good read.

Even if you are not familiar with the Slenderman mythos it's still a good story.

It's **NSFW** due to porn ads along the sides of the page. The story itself is fine. Happy reading.

I am really annoyed with this change from the 12 regenerations rule from the classic series. I don't like the idea of the Doctor finally dying permanently, but it just makes him too powerful and lowers the sense of him actually worrying about death.

This might be a very taboo thing to bring up with a show that is loved by so many, but why not at some point give the Doctor a proper end and do what the Doctor has shown us to be amazing. I think they should let the series end at one point, but after regenerate it!!! Start up an entirely new Doctor Who series starting from the 1st Doctor.  I'm not saying a remake, but why not try to tell a new/old story set in a parallel universe. Just imagine all the new possibilities, but still keeping some old things.

I think the Doctor has taught us that something entirely new can still be the same old thing we loved. No matter how many times he regenerates changes and his personality and appearance, he is still the Doctor. If done right I believe a new story of the Doctor can be told and can be brilliant.

Kick-off is at 15:00 GMT / 10:00 EST / 09:00 PST.

West Brom are an EPL side that find themselves in the midst of a relegation battle, but have afforded themselves a bit of breathing room following successive 5-1 and 4-0 wins against Wolves and Sunderland, which have given them an 11 point gap between themselves and the drop. However, Chelsea have won the last eight league games at the Hawthorns, scoring 21 goals and conceding five. We should expect nothing less than a win.

----
**Team news**:

John Terry ~~remains the sole injured player~~, but his recovery is looking good. Just a week after a knee operation, he was said to be back out training, which can only be taken as a positive.

Totally forgot Bosingwa is injured. Yeah, he's out too (hamstring).

Didier Drogba and Danny Sturridge have both been passed fit and will be expected to start.

We are looking at one place on Finborough Road only about [10 minute walk from the Bridge (absolute dream)](http://i.imgur.com/KnQwa.jpg), but I'm not too sure that this area is a great place for a mid-20s couple. Do you guys have any advice or tips on where to live in London? We like neighborhoods like Brooklyn, Chelsea, and SoHo (in NYC) and were wondering if there was anything similar to that in London. I would obviously love to live within walking distance of the Bridge but want to do what is best for us.

I want to build a server capable of running 20+ VM's under ESXi or Xen (I need flexibility to do both..) in a home lab environment. I've been looking at Dell, but it just cant come up with anything good for under £2000... so I'm looking at building my own. Problem is, I have no idea about UK suppliers.

I will need:

- Decent CPU or two. 4 - 8 cores would be ideal.
- 16GB or 24GB of RAM
- Supported RAID contoller (though this is a sticky point, i could get a drobo instead of local disk..)


Has anyone built one, or can anyone recommend a trusted supplier to help with this? honestly, if i could order a decent dell with no disks at all, I'd just do that, I'm kind of over the whole hardware research phase..

He doesn't score as often anymore, but his goals are always technically excellent and his work on the wings and in the midfield show such a tactical understanding of the game.

Agger is just a boss on defense. My best friend is an Arsenal supporter and he said that he thinks Agger is the best defender in the entire Premier League. Skrtel is great and he's fun to watch because he celebrates a lot and scores great goals on corners with his head, but Agger is just a rock on defense. He's comparable to Carragher in his prime.

I moved to a small town in England almost two years ago. Life is pretty good out here but it is also a little slow, especially when it comes to meeting women my age(27). My social life is at an all time low out here and it´s been about a year since I´ve had a casual encounter. I considered the personal ads section in the paper and I think I might go through with it this time.
The problem is that the personal ads in the local paper are pretty much filled with 40+ year old people looking for long term relationships, meaningful lives and extra long walks on the beach. 
What I am looking for is a no-strings-attached fun night in a hotel room with some booze and a bit of drugs. 
Are there any papers or magazines in Nottingham that would print this sort of ad, and any suggestions on how to phrase it so that I don´t come off as a dangerous creep?

Someone told me it is hard to win games, when you don't score goals. It is true, we don't have 1 player in our squad who can score, we just don't have. We wouldn't have scored a single one without the own-goal. We basically use 5% of our attempts to score a goal. This is just disastrous, not thinkable. 

In 2009 we score like 4-6 every third game, we had 2 players who scored 45 goals in one season. What the fuck happened? Torres left Gerrard isn't that good anymore, it is ok. It is no excuse that we buy players who cost 20m-40m and can't score the easiest goals. We rely on owngoals lately, so sad, makes me cry.

Well at least we can focus now on the FA Cup, the PL is over for us. We need a striker, Newcastle bought for 15m 2 decent strikers, and have now a very nice offense. We just don't have an offense, we are Barcelona without Messi, Xavi and Iniesta, we possess, we pass, we aim, and fail.

So first off, I was recently in Belfast for a week (Feb. 16-28) doing workshops on Conflict Resolution in the lower level schools and am now in need of doing a follow up paper on my experience.

I am focusing my paper on the changes that are needed in Northern Ireland to create more peaceful schools. In my opinion, coming from Canada, your schools are phenomenal and are truly inspirational and could lend a lot to our own school systems. 

So my question to you all is ""What needs to change in order to have more peaceful schools in Northern Ireland?""

I realize that this seems like a very broad question, and it is, that is why I could really use all of your insights and knowledge from living and going through the school system and the day-to-day life of it all.

If you want any further information on anything (what I was doing, or what I would like from you) then please feel free to ask. As I said, this would be a huge help to be able to get some actual first hand thoughts from all of you.

By my accounts, it should (and could) have easily been a 3 or 4 - 2 win for Liverpool today.  But with two posts hit, and a double stop by Szczensy on a PK, we fell short.

However I think that the goal Reina let in was a fairly defensible shot.  He was in position, but his reaction just looked a bit slow.
So that makes me wonder what others think about movin on to a new keeper?

The lawyers want to speak to me.

Now not only do I not want to do this, but I'm also not interested in aiding some no-win no-fee type compensation thing where they sue some company who had nothing to do with it.

Do I have to speak to the lawyers? Can I ignore them? Or write a letter to them say I'm not interested? Can I be summoned to court (It'd be a few hunderd miles away from where I am now)?

The idea of subjecting myself to that made me cringe.

However, now that I'm older (and wiser), I'm considering whether I should hold my nose &amp; just do it after all? Main reason being that I'll get a lower rate on a mortgage (true story!).

That win percentage for AVB is simply disastrous, there's no other way of putting it. I don't see how, even as a transitional year, this is remotely acceptable from a Chelsea boss. I don't see how he can survive, the team isn't that bad from what he inherited from Ancelotti.

I really hope this summer that there is *not* huge fundamental changes to this club.  I think chemistry is one of the most important and underrated parts to being a successful team.

I do feel that *some* changes need to be made, but I hope there is more of a focus on development and team cohesion.

I look at a team like City and think about all the money and players they have burned through since 2008 and their new owners.  It has cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, and while it has definitely worked I don't think it is a realistic approach.

Just all the scenes where you find out what happens without Donna Noble. The Doctor drowning when he floods the Racnos with the Thames. Martha, Sarah Jane, all her kids, dying in the hospital. The Titanic crashing into London, destroying it. The Adipose using America instead of England. Torchwood Three sacrificing their lives to stop the Sontarans. Jack being transported to Sontar.

And then Donna interacting with Rose. 

Donna is The Doctor's greatest Companion. She rose higher than anyone else, and fell so much further. She went from being a temp to saving the whole of reality, and then everlasting death for the most faithful companion.

Hard to believe this episode (and Midnight) was written by RTD. It's such a shame that he can't write an ending. Season four was so well done.

I've read through the wikipedia entries and the TARDIS wiki, but I'm still confused. So I'm unloading a bunch of questions on you folks. 

Ok, we had 3 Donnas: 

* Donna #1 (Original Donna) in the Fortune Teller's booth in the original universe
* Donna #2 (Beetle Donna) with something on her back in the parallel universe
* Donna #3 (Driving Donna) in the car in the parallel universe 


**Questions about the different universes/time-lines**

&gt; Upon examining the beetle, the Doctor tells Donna that it is part of the Trickster's Brigade and that normally it affects one person and the universe compensates (as happened to Sarah Jane Smith), but in Donna's case, it created a parallel universe. [TARDIS wiki](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Turn_Left)

* Ok, so does that mean the Trickster/Time Beetle create a new parallel universe from #1 Original Donna (from her energy?) that previously had not existed -- by splitting that point into a forked path of 2 universes? 

* Is this a real alt universe? Or is it all happening in the Fortune Teller's booth, or inside the Time Beetle (like a miniature world trapped in a snow globe)? Basically creating a type of food source (time? energy?) for itself.

* If it's a real universe/alt timeline, then how do we have so much time passing there (what looks like 1-2 years), yet only a few minutes passing with #1 Original Donna in the Fortune Teller booth? How do these 2 timelines or universes reconcile?


**Questions about the Time Beettle**

I'm very confused on the whole Time Beetle thing. It just leaves me with a ""wait… what?"" conclusion whenever I try to figure it out.

* The way it's attached to Donna's back suggests some kind of parasite. Do the Time Beetles eat time? What is their purpose in relation to the Trickters?

* Why can't most people, including #2 Beetle Donna and her family, see the Time Beetle? Is this some sort of Trickster magic or reality cloaking? I couldn't find an explanation of how the Trickster and Time Beetle work together.

* On a practical issue, how the hell does the whole Time Beetle thing physically play out, being attached to her back and all? I mean, she has this thing on her back, so where does it go when she changes clothes? 

...Does it crawl off when she removes a shirt or coat, then crawl back on? Like, in one scene we see Donna with no coat and she has the Time Beetle on her back (outside her shirt). Then in another scene she does have a coat and the Time Beetle is on the outside of her coat. Was this just an awkward solution by the writers, because viewers wouldn't be able to see the Time Beetle if it crawled underneath and connected directly to her skin? The mechanics of this make the whole premise confusing for me. 


**Questions about Rose**

* Why didn't Rose just directly cause #3 Driving Donna to turn left, or at least interact with her directly instead of the convoluted interactions with #2 Beetle Donna? 


**Questions about Donna**

* How did we get two Donnas existing in the same universe (#2 Beetle Donna and #3 Driving Donna)? How did #2 Beetle Donna get into that universe in the first place, if it was already occupied with an existing Donna (#3)? **ETA:** Or, wait, was #3 Driving Donna in (1) an earlier version of #1 Original Donna's universe [Rose sent Donna into a separate universe AND in a different time]; or (2) simply an earlier time in the same universe [#2 Beetle Donna's]? 

* Also, because I don't understand how these universes are created and how they interact, I don't understand how Donna is ""the most important woman in the whole of creation."" Though [this article](http://doctorher.com/?p=453) made me notice there are some parallels to *Planet of the Spiders* with Sarah Jane. I assume the similarities are purposeful on the part of the writers?

**Summary:**

*OMG time travel and parallel universes make my head go wibbly wobbly.*

We had more chances than Arsenal.
We had more possession than Arsenal.
We missed a penalty.
We hit the post.

We lost, itself pretty typical of this season.


Some Liverpool fans I talk to blame these things on:

Not enough substitutions.
Charlie Adam sucks.
Henderson sucks. 
Downing sucks.
Carroll sucks. 
No Maxi/No Kuyt.
Carragher is poisoning the squad. 

To me, this is completely ridiculous. Think about it. What did you expect to happen this season?

In 2011, we added (off the top of my head): Carroll, Suarez, Adam, Downing, Coates, Henderson, Bellamy, Enrique, Doni, and added to full first team rotation Kelly and Spearing. And lost: Babel, Torres, Meireles, Aquilani, Jovanovic, Pacheco.

Does that not sound like a squad overhaul to you? How many teams did something like this and succeeded right away? 

The difference between this season and last season is simple. Kenny, last season, was trying to salvage as much as he could from the situation that Hodgson left us in. This season, we reworked the whole squad and learned to play a whole new style.

These players, in particular the first team regulars Adam, Henderson, Enrique, Downing, Carroll, and Suarez, were players signed to fit directly into the first team. Picture this:

               Reina
  Johnson Skrtel Agger ENRIQUE
    HENDERSON ADAM Gerrard DOWNING
            SUAREZ CARROLL

This is not an example of signing players to ""fit into"" a previous system. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF REBUILDING A SYSTEM. Think about it. Adam, Henderson, Downing, Suarez, Carroll, and Enrique did not know each other at all before they came to Liverpool. On top of that, the existing squad did not know them either. To make wholesale squad changes, it takes TIME for things to work. 

On top of all of this, while Adam, Downing, and co. are looking to learn how to play with each other and with Gerrard, Lucas, Kuyt, Agger, Carragher, and other Liverpool stalwarts of recent years, players like Gerrard, Lucas, and Agger have been in and out of the squad due to injury, forcing the new guys to have to do it on their own.

In spite of all of this, some of you have the audacity to say things like ""Sell Carroll he is useless"" and ""Adam is a waste in midfield"" and ""Where is Henderson? Waste of 20 million"". 

Do any of you remember where we were a year ago? How about a year before that? To play a team like Arsenal and completely dominate them, only to be undone by luck and poor finishing, with what is clearly our second choice midfield (no Gerrard or Lucas), is something I'm very happy with. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TEAM HAS HAD LESS THAN A SEASON TO LEARN TO PLAY TOGETHER!

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Regardless of what was stated publicly, by those in or around the club, in the long term, the goal for this season was to do as well as possible while rebuilding a squad and making these players play well together. The truth is, they do, they just don't know how to finish. 

A couple more thoughts:

1. Comolli and Kenny looked at the chance creation stats from last season and signed the best players available, those being Henderson, Downing, and Adam. They did the same thing with Suarez at Ajax. One thing you simply cannot deny about this season is that our team has no problems with CREATING CHANCES. 

2. With this in mind, as well as quotes from Comolli stating that the plan is to make only 1-2 changes this summer, its no wonder where he's going to look next, the only thing we lack is FINISHING. So expect some statistically spectacular finishers to come our way this summer. Don't expect wholesale squad changes. They're not coming. They don't breed long-term success. Need proof? Ask Chelsea. Don't expect a managerial appointment. It won't bring long-term success. Need proof? Ask Chelsea.

I mean unless we go on an absolute win streak like in the 2008/2009 season, right after we had lost the title to United, but nevertheless, seeing our luck and lack of finishing abilities, it is just way too far away. 

-Now this has been said many times before in this sub-reddit, but we should play our youth players and reserves. I mean look at the academy team we've got, no doubt one of the best in Europe. Even give some of the older players a bit of a chance. For me Maxi deserves to be on that team before Downing, or Adam. We also must start Carroll every game. We've seen how beneficial he is when his confidence is high. I don't know why Kenny didn't start him today.

I've also been thinking about this for a while, and I would like to know everyone's opinion on this. Now we're guaranteed a spot in the Europa League next year, but as we all know it's not CL. That means that mid-week games are back, and more fatigue. Should we treat it as if it was CL and play our best players? Or give the young lads a shot, and have our senior players focus on top 4. Personally I'd go focus on top 4.

PS. We need a God damn finisher. Bad. Suarez has too much weight on his shoulders. He can't do everything. And Carroll still needs time to develop.

Technically, I have permanent leave to remain (at Her Majesty's pleasure, according to my visa; I try to please her always). I became eligible to apply for a citizenship 5 years ago, but I wasn't sure I wanted to, and around that time the home secretary (remember David Blunkett? he of the myopic policies, and irresponsible oversight?) changed the rules so I'd have to do stupid tests &amp; swear allegiance to the queen. The idea of subjecting myself to that made me cringe.

However, now that I'm older (and wiser), I'm considering whether I should hold my nose &amp; just do it after all? Main reason being that I'll get a lower rate on a mortgage (true story!).

So, I thought I'd ask if any redditors have been through the process, how much does it cost, how long does it take, do you really have to swear allegiance to a living person etc. Any tips/advice gratefully received. Thanks.

If anyone wants either of these I'd be willing to sell them at, you know, a reasonable discount. I will pre-warn you: one of the keyboard buttons was chewed by a rabbit and looks a bit rough, but they all still work. The guitar is beautiful in every way, but I just don't have the time to learn.

So yeah, if anyone wants these at a steal that'd be awesome. The cheapest price for the guitar I can find is £90 online so I'll sell it for £70 with the bag and some picks chucked in.

First of all, I don't regret watching it at all. The story was outstanding, I liked the characters, and each episode ended on a great cliffhanger. I enjoyed the way that the serial was narrated in a Western song.

Even so, the episode seemed very weak in a ""Doctor Who"" sense. Instead of the TARDIS, the three time travelers could have rode into town on horses at the beginning of the serial and left the same way at the end and it would have made no difference to the story; no time travel, no technology, almost no clever Doctor wit, very little humour. I guess it was very ""Doctor Who"" in the sense that we got to travel back in time and witness how the Doctor participated in a piece of history, even if the piece of history wasn't very accurate. ;) Also, it seems that the serial has been ranked rather poorly.

**In summary**, The Gunfighters is a great story but kind of a weak Doctor Who serial. Would you recommend it to someone who wants to watch the best episodes of the first Doctor?

Please correct me if any of this info is wrong but I think it is all accurate. 

**Record with Romeu** making any appearance at all, all competitions, (excluding 1-0 W over Blackburn where he came on in the 90+):

**12W 7D L2**

 Out of these
    8W 4D 1L when he plays over 60 mins
    4W 3D 1L when he plays less
    8W 1D 1L when he plays the whole match

**Record when Romeu does not feature** in any capacity, all competitions  (including Blackburn game):

**6W 3D 9!!!L**

We dropped points after he came off early against Villa and Wigan.

Should also mention he played full 90 against city, valencia, newcastle, sunderland. Arguably our biggest wins of the season.

Clearly this isn't exactly the greatest way to assess a player's impact but I think it says something. 

So are we missing Oriol's 1-2 touch passing in midfield? Has he only featured in easier fixtures? Has he just been lucky? Or a bit of all three? Thoughts?

Liverpool dropped 3 points at home for the first time this season, and will look to bounce back next weekend. 

First of all, I’d like to say, good job guys. Despite the result, I still think that the Reds produced a fine performance. The Liverpool players were tirelessly closing Arsenal players down whilst they kept their play neat and brought the ball forward well, so I genuinely think (although I’ve thought this several times this season) that we genuinely should have walked away with 3 points yesterday afternoon. So, for more a breakdown.

4 Mar 12 ReplyRetweetFavorite 

Our penalty taking is poor. It’s a fact now. I find it fairly surprising that we walked away from Wembley as a result of a penalty shootout just last weekend. We need more penalty taking practice at Melwood over the next week or so, as penalties are goals that we simply must take. 

Luis Suarez, in my opinion, put in a good game yesterday. This section here mostly relates to my response to this article here. Luis Suarez is a top notch striker, just lacking in a bit of service from the midfield department. And for all the people still branding him a cheat, most people would still take a handball and take your nation to the semi finals of the World Cup. After all, it is the World Cup. 

And of yesterday’s performance, I won’t lie. He exaggerated his fall when Szczesny supposedly took him down. The Uruguayan has to stop doing controversial things. But apart from that, he used the ball well and lead the line alone very well. I particularly found the combination play between him and our Dutch striker Dirk Kuyt particularly pleasing. 

And of the statistics. 

28 players have scored more goals than Suarez in the Premier League this Season. 100 have more assists. 26 have a better key pass average. 
As I said, overrated. 
Daniel Thomas 

First of all, he has been out on a suspension which saw him miss many games in the Premier League. There was also another match suspension due to his finger pointing antics against Fulham earlier on in the season. All this means that Suarez hasn’t had the proper game time to be compared against other strikers in the Premier League. 

Another reason that really means for a hard time for the Uruguayan is the fact that he is a heavily marked man. He is really the only target for Liverpool targets, given there being a lack of depth in the offensive department for Liverpool FC. What this means is tight man marking. The likes of Sergio Aguero have more along side them to create a goal, eg. Dzeko, Balotelli, Silva, and therefore it is hard to keep them all out. 
OK. 

So that’s it with match review. Apparently Liverpool FC are targeting five players in the summer, with a transfer kitty of around 75 million pounds made available for Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish. 

There’s a very positive vibe around the club across Europe. A lot players I know are very interested about joining the project because it’s a very interesting project. We already know that there are big players who want to join us next summer because they believe in the project. Everybody in Europe knows what Liverpool football club are trying to do. 
-Damien Comolli 

So that’s it for today. Be sure to be back tomorrow for more!

This thread is not about the AVB decision, but what are your thoughts on the near and also distant future. Is Di Matteo going to be able to take the club till the end of the season and be successful? With Jose coming to London last week, and this week as well, is he set to return? Do you prefer anyone over Jose at this point?

My opinion is that I like having Di Matteo come in because is very familiar with the club and there is not much bad coming out about him. Also I would not be suprised if Jose does return after the way he has been in London recently. I feel as though Jose would be ready to move on from Madrid after taking La Liga and especially if they have Champions League success (theyre my pick to win it).

Lets make this a good discussion and not just downvote everything you disagree, thats not the point.

EDIT: I also feel like we have a great long-term outlook with youth in McEachran, Piazon, Lukaku, Kakuta, De Bruyne, Bruma, van Aanholt all skilled and out on loan (except Piazon + Lukaku). This goes with Mata, Sturr, Romeu, Luiz, Cahill, Ramires, and Cahill who have many years left at top class levels.

The idea of subjecting myself to that made me cringe.

However, now that I'm older (and wiser), I'm considering whether I should hold my nose &amp; just do it after all? Main reason being that I'll get a lower rate on a mortgage (true story!).

So, I thought I'd ask if any redditors have been through the process, how much does it cost, how long does it take, do you really have to swear allegiance to a living person etc. Any tips/advice gratefully received. Thanks.

It seems that ever since Roman took over the club, he (and many fans) possess a certain expectation of immediate results. This, and I believe this alone, is what is stopping Chelsea from reaching our goals. 

Under Ranieri's lone season at Chelsea with Roman, he was unable to secure any trophies despite finishing second in the EPL, despite winning the FA Cup and securing CL football for us the previous season (without which we would likely have not been bought by Roman anyways).

Mourinho's spell brought us consecutive league titles, an FA Cup and two Carling Cups. It's a pretty typical Mourinho spell, as he obviously knows how to win, but he appears to be a mercenary coach given his length spent on any given project.

Grant was next, could not secure the CL, was fired immediately after.

Scolari was brought in, couldn't do anything basically, was fired.

Hiddink was able to bring us back to form, winning the FA Cup, securing fourth place, and continuing our CL progress.

Carlo Ancelotti took over full time. He wins the double in his first season, but finished second place the next year and is fired for it, along with a poor CL display.

AVB is brought in, and despite showing the courage to try new tactics and introduce new blood that Carlo and any other coach was not able to do, he was fired for a poor run of form.

Roman wants a coach that can bring us trophies right away, and for a long time. He wants a Ferguson. But Ferguson's first years were not all golden. Wenger faced similar difficulties when he took over from Arsenal, with Arsenal captain Tony Adams being quoted as saying ""What does this Frenchman know about football? He wears glasses and looks more like a schoolteacher. He’s not going to be as good as George [Graham]. Does he even speak English properly?"" - remind you of Lampard, anyone? 

No, AVB did not impress - I think given the squad he had, his results could and should have been much better, in the Premier League and FA Cup especially. But I liked his vision, I liked where he was going and what he wanted to do with the team. I was willing to accept a few sub-standard years for long-term gains. 

I think Roman needs to stop thinking that he can sign a coach and win all the titles; our old guard is incapable of doing that, and as we transition away from them, there will be tension, there will be conflict, and most importantly, there will be defeat. But I think it will be worth it, it would have been worth it under AVB. Look at the players that he specifically brought in (Mata and Romeu). They were the types of players that he would have injected into the team, along with our own youth players (Sturridge, Lukaku, McEachran, de Bruyne, Piazon, and all others). We had a glimpse of long-term success with AVB, and we snuffed it out because we ran into a few problems.

I find it somewhat strange that more people seem to be lashing out at Harry based on today's performance than last week's debacle. Here are two reasons to feel some positive vibes in spite of the result. 

**The players demonstrated mental strength**  
After a 5-2 defeat against our nearest rivals, I think it's safe to say more than a few fans (myself included) despaired. It was a depressing week and our preparation wouldn't have been helped by the international break. 

Yet we came out aggressively, dominated possession, passed the ball well, and worked our asses off. 

We took a sucker punch at the absolute worst possible moment, and I think most people probably expected United to carry that into the second half and start bossing the game. Nope, again, we started the second half much the better side and only a fine De Gea save off a deflected shot maintained United's advantage. 

Playing against a team that we haven't defeated in 11 years, one might almost expect the players to let their heads drop at 1-0, back off, and invite pressure. It wasn't until 3-0 that the fans and players really capitulated.

The last time we shipped 8 goals in 2 games, we rattled off a ridiculous run of wins. I think today showed that the players haven't lost their ability to respond. It'll be difficult to get them up for next week, but I think the manager can do it. 

**Discipline**  
While we once again displayed a propensity to switch off in dead ball situations, the team was incredibly well-drilled and organized today. Sandro and Livemore completely shut down Scholes and Rooney was very rarely allowed to drop deep and influence the game. Occasionally our center mids got carried away and left space behind, but it was very rare and the players were quickly made aware of it and fixed it. 

Perhaps most reassuring was our wing play. Lennon and Modric BOTH did their defensive responsibilities very well. United did not look threatening from open play at all until we had to chase the game. 

This leads me to believe that Harry saw what happened against Arsenal and made it a massive point to rectify it. If we play with this type of organization for the rest of the season, we will be just fine. Our biggest problem over the past 2 months has been our positional discipline, and if we have finally acknowledged it, it bodes very well. 
___________

Ultimately I feel a lot better after this game than I have in a while. I think Harry knows exactly what to say: it's done with, look at the teams we have coming up, just play like we did today and we will almost certainly get 3rd. 

Had we come out flat I would have probably been the one to post the ""goodbye 3rd"" topic, but strangely a 3-1 loss has given me some optimism. ",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,default,Reassurance in Defeat,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/qhg9q/reassurance_in_defeat/

The next Build Brighton board games night is this Wednesday (7th). We'll be at the hackspace from 6:30 and have a couple of very special games this month.

Rich Willis will be bringing a game that he's created called Peacehaven: The Bored Game. He's been developing it with a few test groups and it's currently on version 5.0. I played it a couple of weeks ago and it's a great (though slightly terrifying) party game.

We'll also have the Game of Thrones board game: apparently it's absolutely epic so we'll be trying to get a game on the go early on in the evening.

Some of the other games we've got on hand are:

* Carcassonne
* Power Grid
* Stone Age
* Citadels
* Ticket To Ride: Europe
* Small World
* Mindflex

Or, bring your own game and show us how to play it!

We're based at Brighton Hackspace in the Rodhus building on Hollingdean Road, BN2 4AA, and hold board gaming evenings on the first Wednesday of the month. Here are some directions on how to find us: http://www.buildbrighton.com/blog/contact/how-to-find-us/

There's an eccentric woman who travels through space and time calling herself The Professor, and a little green wooden shed called the **D**oor to **E**verywhere and **N**owhere, that's bigger on the inside. 

##Come with me if you want to live
Jamie was just a normal guy, with no friends or family caring about him. He lived in the bad part of town, and went to work in a restaurant on the upper floors of a big mall. He was just a waiter. Then one day, plastic dummies tried to kill him, and The Professor saved him, but blew up the mall. The next day the hand of one of the dummies followed him, and showing up in the nick of time, The Professor saved him again, and used the hand to lead her back to where they were coming from, beneath the haunted house. After she got grabbed by a mummy, it was Jamie's turn to save the Professor, and he also managed to save the ride operator. With a Pulse Disruptor Grenade, the plastic hivemind was paralysed, giving The Professor a chance to rip out it's neural center and destroy it. 

In exchange for saving her (twice, but who's counting), The Professor offered Jamie a single trip, to anywhere in space or time. So Jamie chose Gliese 851 (g), better known in the future as Zarmina (from the current unofficial name Zarmina's World). A place with purple trees, and red grass that smells like apples, and a park filled with strange beings and a little blue haired kid that Jamie played frisbee with. Then the two headed off to the museum. After The Professor accidentally on purpose hit a guy in the head with a read bouncy ball.

##How much trouble can you get into in a museum?

After Jamie made a beeline to the Sol 3 section, and saw the history (slash future) of space travel, it was obvious that The Professor was only interested in museums as a way to see how much the Archeologists got right, and how much she'd done in the past. Keeping score. The two split ways after The Professor got angry at one of the plaques, and set off to find more fault with history. Meanwhile, Jamie followed some scuttling shadow going unnoticed through the halls. It lead him back to the research and storage room, and he stumbled across a strange rock, with weird coloured patterns. And an empty inside, with a broken outside: An egg. And it became obvious that it was some kind of insect that broke out.

Trying to keep it from breaking any more of the artifacts, Jamie tried to grab the mysterious space insect, that must have been mistaken for a fossil or a rock or a piece of art, only to corner it. The thing jumped out at him, and stabbed him in the chest with it's stinger. It was just a needle sized thing, but Jamie's chest was feeling tight and heavy and he sought out the Professor; and then the alarms went off.

##An awful lot of running

It seems the Professor was busy as well, being chased by out of shape security guards, carrying some big boxy fossil and wearing a manic glee splashed across her face in a smile. She grabbed Jamie and his bug, and high tailed it out of there. She kicked down a fire exit, and grabbed onto a passing trolley, barely paying attention while Jamie kept trying to tell her he might be dying. She was too busy looking over her shoulder at the two out of shape guards coming round the corner and doubling over panting, and shaking their fists.

The two made it back to the DEN, running across the park without stopping, and The Professor explained that the box was the black box of a Byzantium class starship, *The Constantinople*, one of the greatest crashes in history, graffitied with a message to her. Only when she set the DEN in flight did she realize Jamie wasn't looking so good, just in time to see the kid pass out and tumble to the ground.

##Oh God what do I do?

And from here, I have no idea, and I'm sort of stalling. I've got until I get back from the store to figure out what to do that isn't a rip off of *Time of Angels* or *Silence in the Library*. I don't know what it'll be, but it'll be *brilliant*. Now, I know this isn't [/r/rpg](/r/rpg) (well, not until I crosspost it, at least), but I'm sort of hoping that with this little teaser, I can get some suggestions of what to do for the future. I know what happens next is that the waspeetle poison is going to make Jamie keep flipping genders, although I haven't thought of why. That'll mean The Professor has to keep him close, to figure out how to fix it, and can't really set him back to his own time (not that he didn't want to stay on Zarmina).",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,I'm running a Doctor Who style RPG [Update],2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/qhrlx/im_running_a_doctor_who_style_rpg_update/

In the episode *Blink* The Doctor describes the Weeping Angels as ""the only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death."" Watching this episode I can't help thinking, how nice is this, really? 

**Let's say you get zapped by a Weeping Angel today:**

* Everyone you know and love is gone from your life. 
* You suddenly have to start over in a new place *and time*, with only what you physically had on you. 
* You have no job, no housing, no transportation, no connections. 
* You also have no usable documentation to prove your identity, as your driver's license or other cards show a future date. Which will make it even harder to acquire any of the above.
* Your job skills may be useless in a previous time period: before the internet, before computers, before that particular industrial invention. 
* You'll likely be facing class restrictions regardless of your prior education or economic status. 
* You'll likely be confronted with significant (possibly relentless) discrimination based on your gender, race, sexual orientation and/or religion.
* All of your prior accomplishments are lost and likely meaningless in this earlier time. 
* And you'll be dealing with all this while trying to learn and navigate the social customs of a place and time that are likely foreign to you.

**TL;DR:** So in short, you start off homeless, jobless and penniless with no friends or family to help you. Given the restrictions one would be facing -- technological, medical, social, cultural -- isn't this in many ways a fate worse than a quick simple death?

No matter which side you are on, you are an idiot if you think it's a good idea to sack a manager half way through the season without an replacement ready to take over. 

Di Matteo is going to be Abramovich's puppet to keep his job and I have no idea who will take on the permanent position. I know Mourinho has been spotted around London recently and he has said that he wants to come back to the UK but, do really think that with his power struggle with Abramovich in the past and after the events of AVB that he would want to take up a job here? 

He wanted greater control when he was here at is pretty obvious that the manager at Chelsea has very little power. It would be great if Mourinho did agree to come back but, I highly doubt it will happen.

I hope AVB finds a good club, and if we play them I hope we get dominated and lose 5 - 0 or something to teach Abramovich a lesson. 

I don't even know if I want to continue supporting a team that is so corrupt and idiotic. I guess I will see how Birmingham plays out and what Abramovich's 'Big Changes' are in the Summer.

A guy that we have a very realistic shot at getting and would be a great option is Clint Dempsey. 

Dempsey has been lethal ever since moving higher up for Fulham (I wonder if that had to do with a certain manager leaving...). He is becoming almost too big for Fulham, but might not break into a team like United, City or Chelsea at this point in time. Liverpool would be an obvious step up for him and would fill an obvious void for the Reds.

Bottom line is, Dempsey seems to be a very attainable signing for Liverpool. He is a guy that I am sure has CL aspirations (who doesn't?), but also a guy that wants to play on a regular basis. Liverpool offers him a step up in his career, playing time and a better chance at a top four finish than at Fulham. 

I know there were rumours of him making a move last year, but I feel with his current form he will be looking for a step up in his club career as he is turning 29 this year.

*Background info*

http://blog.sport.co.uk/Football/241/Top_Ten_Player_Managers.aspx

&gt;**Ruud Gullit (Chelsea, 1996-1998)**

&gt;One of the greatest Dutch players to have ever graced the game of football, Chelsea fans knew they were in for a treat when Ruud Gullit chose to spend the last few years of his career in west London.

&gt;Having initially been signed on a bosman deal by Glen Hoddle, Gullit played the 1995-96 season as part of the squad before being appointed player-manager at the end of the campaign when Hoddle left to take on the England job. The Dutchman proved himself to be a highly astute manager, guiding Chelsea to sixth place in the Premiership and leading his side to victory in the 1997 FA Cup Final with his particular brand of “sexy football”. However, Gullit was sacked the following season after a disagreement with Ken Bates despite the club sitting an unprecedented second in the Premier League table.  

&gt;**Gianluca Vialli (Chelsea, 1998-2000)**

&gt;Chelsea owner Ken Bates further displayed his fetish for player-managers when he appointed Gianluca Vialli in the role following the dismissal of Ruud Gullit in the early part of 1998.
Although Gullit had laid the groundwork for a successful season by leading Chelsea to two cup quarter-finals and second place in the league,

&gt;Vialli demonstrated good managerial ability alongside the 83 appearances he made for the Blues between 1996 and 1999. The Italian led the Stamford Bridge outfit to glory in both the Coca-Cola Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup in 1998, as well as guiding the team to a fourth place finish in the Premiership. Vialli made his final appearance for Chelsea in 1999 but continued as manager for another year, leading the club to yet another FA Cup victory in 2000.

So, what are your thoughts on playing Pizzaro instead of nige? Do you think that NDJ will end up leaving? (contract problems). I think he's good for the morale at city, and it'd be sad to see him leave!

And with the Carling Cup win under our belts we already have Europa league action guaranteed for next year. So where we finish in the league is just a sake of pride now really. 

With that in mind I say the club should use this opportunity to use the league games as a method of testing new tactics and experimenting a bit (while concentrating more so on the FA cup). Perhaps try out some new ideas (Glen Johnson on the wing for example). Or let some of the reserves get a taste of premier league action.  

So if the club were to do this what would you like to see them trying? I'd like to see some of the youngsters given a crack at the premier league. Give Nathan Eccleston a game. Maybe he'll be able to get some goals that our current strikers are failing to find.

They are small but established, with 10 years under their belts and a huge passion for technology. 

This is a client facing role where you work as your own project manager, and you will need the ability to be truly agnostic in order to give objective advice to clients. The developers here work in a collaborative environment and are looking for someone who can manage their own workload and bounce ideas around the office and assist other members of the team. 

You will be working in an Agile environment and have a very broad knowledge of languages and programming paradigms (particularly OO and Functional – but Declarative is very interesting to them too) with strong Unix and Windows experience. It is vital to have experience of all stages of the project life-cycle and that you have a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures. 

Your knowledge of at least three programming languages will be extensive, and can be in C#, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Scheme, F#, Erlang, Java, or something more exotic. You will have a passion and interest in programming languages, as demonstrated by your blog/tech Twitter feed/github account/published articles. An extracurricular interest in computer science is a necessity – contribution to open source projects a huge advantage. 

World-renowned for their consultancy skills and software releases, our client will provide you with the framework to programme in any language, and become a top-quality problem solver.

Besides the fact we are finally back in Europe, I think it serves three great purposes:

(1) Based on how we have played this year, I doubt we would be able to win the CL next year without some serious changes to our training (ie, finishing, penalty taking, etc.) and another signing or two (ie, poacher, creative winger, etc.) anyways. Would it really be better to end up being knocked out of the CL at the group stages than to win the EL outright (rather than winning after being dropped from CL to EL)? I, for one, would find that to be a bit disappointing, much like the Dirty Mancs and SAF seemed to feel after they were dropped.

(2) With a theoretically weaker field in the EL, we could get some of our younger stars some first-team football for a bit longer than we would have been able to do in the CL. As some of us have been discussing, the rest of the Prem season could be devoted to getting younger players some game time, trying out new tactics, etc. Doing that on the European scene would give our young up and comers the taste of glory that neither the NextGen Series or other ""lesser"" domestic tournaments ever could.

(3) Most importantly, to me at least, this could be our chance to singularly own the EL record for most victories by any team.  Right now we are tied at 3 each with Juventus and Inter. I, for one, would love to see a time when Liverpool owns the records, alone, in both European tournaments (CL is 9 Real Madrid vs 7 Milan vs 5 LFC) at the moment. Based on the club's history and the supporters' and players' demand for success, this should (should being the operative word here) really be our last shot ever at EL glory since we MUST be in the CL from now on to live up to our Top 4 team billing.

So what say you Reds? EL - a chance to cement LFC's glory throughout all of Europe or a stumbling block in the path to success? You all obviously know I think it is the former rather than the latter, but I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Europa League - Is our participation next year really as bad as some are making it out to be?,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/qin3p/europa_league_is_our_participation_next_year/

* Pep Guardiola - Love the guy. Who wouldn't after the system he's built at Barca. Sure we don't have a Messi, but his managerial talent is still there.
* Sven Goran Eriksson - Dafuq? I don't even... please no.
* Guus Hiddinck - The man's been here before, proven he can do well here.
* The Special One - Gonna have to include him. Nuff' said.

But then again, which self-respecting manager is gonna want to work here now? The situation after Carlo was bad enough, this is worse imo.
