I know they're pretty long, but it may give you a perspective on what its like to be a Kopite stateside. I'd Love to hear any stories from anyone else, its always a pleasure. I feel like everyone has their own unique story as to why they love the club. Since its my cakeday, i thought I could get away with telling you some of my own.

I live in the US(NYC area). I have never had the opportunity to go to Anfield or even anywhere across the atlantic. But I've loved LFC for as long as I've loved football. I was too young for the glory days but I am ever grateful I was able to watch us over the decades. For as much as all our trophies and great players make me proud, being SO physically detached from the club made me wonder if it was really worth it, especially in the post-rafa days. But 3 things happened last season that made hate myself for even questioning the club.

I went to watch the Carling Cup final at a lfc supporters pub(E. 11th st) in nyc. It was my first time ever being around so many reds. The atmosphere seemed almost authentic. I got to chat and chant with scousers and local fans. But the moment I'll never forget is when Skrtel equalized. The place erupted, everyone was jumping, screaming, and dancing. I was enjoying every minute of it, jubilant and wide-eyed, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I dropped my scarf, a man I had never met walked through the crowd, tapped me, and handed it back to me with a smile. We then hugged and celebrated with everyone else, straight through to Stevie lifting the trophy. This act of brotherhood stuck with me, especially considering it was my first time with so many other fans. He could have forgot about it, but he made a point to help me out, and then we got on well afterwards, like we were always friends.

For the FA cup final I tried to go to the same pub. As expected, they were at capacity and I was forced elsewhere. On the way I met a Scouser named Mike, who was on business. He and his wife made it a point to watch every game and this was no different. As we walked down the street of NY he Thrilled me with his stories of Istanbul, the treble, the kops last stand, and the glory days. Hearing these stories from someone who was there, in person, it was like hearing them for the first time. It didnt hurt that he bought me pint after pint of guinness. He let me speak to his son who was at Wembley. I heard the roar of the crowd behind him, it sounded immense. Scouse Mike told me if I was ever in Lpool to give him a call and he'd give me a room and show me the ropes (thanks Scouse Mike! Wherever you are). He showed the humility, humor, knowledge, and passion that I always heard about the fans.

Later that year, I got to see the team play in Baltimore against Spurs in what is widely regarded as a shite pre-season game, but it meant the world to me. Seeing Stevie and Carra in the flesh is something I always dreamed of. At halftime I belted out YNWA with the other fans. I felt like i was singing for all the times I wanted to sing at anfield but couldn't. I cheered every pass and tackle, I don't know if I'd have survived had liverpool scored.
After the game me and about 6 other LFC fans were waiting for the buses to pass, hoping to catch a glimpse. We swapped stories and I spoke with a man who drove up with his brother and son from Alabama to Baltimore just for the game. He told me about his short time in England when he got to watch the best team in the world. The club showed him incredible kindness and arranged tours, gifts, and an audience with King Kenny and Ian Rush. Tears came down his eyes as he described everything like it was yesterday. We had a laugh about how he made a fool of himself in front of Kenny. We awed at his description of the Kop in full voice. Hell, we even flipped off the spurs bus as it exited. The love this man had towards the club was amazing. He, like me, lives thousands of miles away from anything close to the Mersey River, yet he still showed all the passion of scouse mike. Even better, the great treatment the club showed him gave me hope of one day meeting my heroes and walking in that famous stadium. To see him and, moreover, his son together at game showed me the club is alive and well state-side, and that I should be a part of it.

This past year brought me closer to the one thing that has been a constant in my life. Thanks for reading! I hope I can hear more stories from all the brothers and sisters I have in this community. You've really showed me the meaning of You'll Never Walk Alone.

(*kidding about the flawless)

The major problem is the disconnect between the back four and the attacking four and the imbalance for attacking and defending. It takes WAY too long to move from our third to the final third. By the time we get into the opposing teams half, they have already set up their defensive structure, pretty much rendering our attack completely useless. Up until Ba, we didn't even have anyone to cross the ball into the box for as a last ditch attempt. This is why Luiz's passes stand out so much, he is the ONLY person who can pass more than 50 yards to direct our attack. 

Under RDM we suffered defensively because Hazmatar went full tilt attack. Now while successful attacking, we were shaky defensively. Under Rafa we have sacrificed this attacking prowess for defensive responsibilities. 

To cut to the chase our two holding midfielders are being misused and the wrong players are being put in this position. First we need a midfielder who can QUICKLY distribute the ball from the back four to the front four. Additionally these players NEED to act as a defensive enforcer in the midfield. Perfect examples are Makelele, Ballack, Toure, Fellaini etc. This way Hazmatar don't need to sacrifice their offensive prowess for more involvement with defence and we can easily transition from defence to attack. Mikel fills this role well, eventually Oriol will too. That being said, as much as I love Ramires and Lampard (Im not saying we should get rid of either), they can't play in this position. They are both Box-to-box midfielders and act pretty much as strikers in the midfield. Not only are their talents being wasted in this position, but its adversely affecting how we play. We are filling square pegs in round holes. 

We need two Modric/Fellaini/Makelele type players in the holding spots who have the ability to have a physical presence in the midfield and pass like Luiz.

Why does the BBC just print all these claims (which are frequently inconsistent or downright opposites) without ever trying to figure out if what is said is true or not? As journalists, shouldn't they be trying to better inform the viewers with fact checks and reviews rather than just confusing everyone with politicians fighting each other using unsubstantiated ""facts""?

The US had some really good dedicated fact checking journalists, especially during their election. e.g. [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker) and [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/).

In the thread there was a reply about our players not being world class. I could not find that thread again so I though I would share my views.

To me, world class players are the players that can single handedly change the course of a game. Think Messi, Ronaldo, Zlatan and their ilk. Liverpool has those players. We have Gerrard and Suarez. Previously we've also had Torres and Alonso. All of them are players I consider world class. What Liverpool haven't had for many years is quality support to their star players. If we take a look at the top teams currently: Man Utd, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Dortmund, (I can go on for a while but I'll leave it at this). They all have quality support players. Players who do the dirty work, like Busquets, Xavi, Pedro, Di Maria and Benzema. All quality players, but they take on a supporting role to the true stars. Right now Liverpool is starting to build that core of players again. The core that will let incredibly talented players become superstars. 

I think football fans in general are to focused on getting that one player who will change the teams fortunes rather than having a team that can possibly let a current player change his fortunes. Just look at Luis Suarez this season. The players that support him have really given him the possibility to shine. Much like in Uruguay where he's the best player on the team. He eclipses Cavani for me, and that is because he has the players to work with. We need more players that can do the unsexy work on a football pitch to let everyone have a bigger oppurtunity to shine.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,World class players and their supporting cast,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/16qy2t/world_class_players_and_their_supporting_cast/

I have a couple of questions about the course and aspects about living in Oxford, feel free to chime in if you don't study engineering.

1.   With the high workload do you get to go out on weekends a lot?
1. Do you like living in Oxford?
1. Would you rather be located in London or Oxford now you know what living there is like?
1.   Do you like the 8 week term system?
1.   How intense are the 8 weeks on, and what do you do in your 8 weeks off?
1.     What did you do after the first year for accommodation?
1.     Do you enjoy the course?
1.     In an average week how much practical work do you get to do?
1.     What do you plan on doing for a career?
1.     Would it be feasible to study this course then go on to get a job (or get a PhD) in aeronautics?
1.     Is there a good sense of community in your college? (bonus points if you can tell me about St. Catz.)
1.     Would you recommend the course?
1.     Have you experienced any disadvantages doing a general course?
1.     If you got the choice to choose between engineering science and a more vocational course such as aeronautical or mechanical engineering would you still choose engineering science?

I don't expect anyone to answer them all! I just want to get a good idea of what it will be like there as I'm having trouble deciding between this and a course in aeronautical engineering. If you feel there's anything you want to add as well, go for it! The more information, the better.

**EDIT**: I think I know just about everything I need to know now, although if you want to add anything more then go for it! I can't thank you all enough, this has been immensely helpful.

Thanks!

I'm taking a bus from Edinburgh to Newcastle tomorrow ahead of the game. One problem - I don't have a ticket. I only found out today that they won't be selling away tix at St James' and it's too late to buy one online. Away tix are only available at Madejski until 5pm tomorrow.

Is anybody going to the game able to buy an extra ticket and meet up with me on Saturday? I will obviously reimburse you. I'd also be eternally grateful and drinks will be on me ~~forever~~ for the day. Pretty desperate at this stage seeing as I flew to Edinburgh solely because I wanted to make this game.

It is often lamented you don't see ""moderates"" condemning ""extremists"", so thought you might appreciate it:

&gt;These actions are utterly unacceptable and clearly designed to stoke tensions and sow discord. We wholly condemn them. The East London Mosque is committed to building co-operation and harmony between all communities in this borough. The actions of this tiny minority have no place in our faith nor on our streets.

&gt;Earlier this week we contacted the Police and the local authorities to alert them to the presence of these individuals and video. We advise anyone who has been harassed by these individuals to contact the Police.

&gt;We will monitor the situation closely and our Imams will be speaking out against such actions.

I didn't graduate from uni for this shit. I'd like to get a small mindless job... But I'm concerned that if I tell ESA/Job Seekers they will just throw me into the first job that comes along. I've recently after 30 years JUST now accepted I have asperger's sydrome. Which is an high functioning autism meaning I can become an socially awkward penguin with certain if not all groups of people. Also I can struggle with social cues and how to behave at work.

I remember the type of work I've enjoyed or stayed the longest at (I've never had a long term full time job. EVER. Longest work I've done have been part time positions) were;

-Working for UCI cinema 

-Working for Odeon Cinema (There were parts I didn't like but I forget. I think it was retail. Too many people. The ice cream stands and ushering were fine and I refuses to work box office. I'd shit myself due to dylexia and the autism I'd make a mistake and lose my job, anyway. I guess I just remembered)

-Working in pubs (I liked the music and the female attention. I disliked druggies, fights and rude impatient people)

- Working for theatre shows, I worked for Cirque du Soleil in the VIP tent (I can't think of anything I didn't like. I was working with pretty ladies, on opening night attending to D-List celebs and attending closing parties with the cast and crew. Thinking about it now I was self concious that my boss didn't like me or us. It was quiet but had periods of busi-ness but not too busy. It was manageable for me)
Vounteering for an youth and disabled theatre (There I was able to use my degree and help shows theatrically run smoother. What I didn't like was the lack of money in the theatre (The access we had to props, staging etc BEFORE we dipped into funding), funding and audience

-Working in a small local supermarket (I loved the banter, the people there and the fact it was a small group of people and again it wasn't crazy busy. I hated early mornings, as I was a student and wasn't used to 7 o clock starts. Now I fear I'd over sleep due to the depression and random sleeping patterns)

Being a form of waiter at Gormet Burger Thingy - I enjoyed serving small groups of people, the relationship I had with my work mates... I disliked getting shouted at for fucking up an order or being too slow with service (With started to happen more before I left. I left due to something else which triggered my depression... That's another story)  

Thank you for being so patient and awaiting a question:

What kind of help and support will I be able to get to ease me into the right kind of work. I'm frightened that if I don't feel comfortable in a job and I leave or get fired, I'm going to end up a bigger mess than I was before work.

Also how will returning to job hunting differ when still being depressed? I know the government is now less helpful to those with high functioning autism in terms of support with everyday commininity activities so we get thrown in with everyone else looking for work. 

Basically any general help and advice for an depressed high functioning autistic man.

Even at the wonderfully blissful 18-20 year old era it did not matter to me.  But before I knew it I was kicked out of college and had really no future ahead of me with my addictions in the way.  I eventually got a job and while I was getting my act together in 2006 my friends told me to start watching the EPL and specifically they were all Spurs fans but this one guy tipped me on to Liverpool.  

I began to try and watch games more often I caught most of the EPL but I will say I officially committed when the 07/08 season began, I didn’t miss a game.  I was at home trying to figure my life out, trying to put my addictions behind me and before I knew it I was head over heels for Liverpool.  I spent countless nights sorting my life out and coming home to catch the replay of EPL games, catching Stevie g's free kick against AV, watching fowler's last season in a red jersey.  Before I knew it I had become enamored with the entire LFC mentality.  I learned their message, their history, and their passion.  

Before I knew it I was addicted to Liverpool and I could certainly live with that, but most of all from the Liverpool FC bible, I learned the idea that anyone from anywhere can be a red so long as they know that once you join the family no matter where you go, you shall never walk alone.  That loyalty can hopefully carry an individual to new heights and allow them to challenge and conquer anything.  I hope that message can carry me through my tough times now.

I am only 24, and I have ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" tattooed on my shoulders.  Regardless of what happens I cannot even thank Liverpool enough for what it has done for me, I have never been to Anfield, I may never touch the beloved sign but it carried me through the worst time in my life and still to this day gives me child-like joy.  Wish me like /r/liverpoolfc/

TLDR; Fucked up a lot and got kicked out of college, in newfound (albeit terribly found) downtime I watched and loved everything LFC, now may have ball-ish cancer and want to thank LFC for saving me from drugs. But still Fuck.

So, I've noticed while watching QI on TV here that both Alan Davies and Steven Fry aren't shy about jumping into a bit of ching-chonglish to imitate Chinese people (can't remember if they also go for the slit-eyed thing). 

Now, here in Australia, we have loads of people of Chinese heritage and this sort of thing on an Australian TV show would be frowned upon. I presume there are many more people of south Asian heritage in the UK than Chinese, or at least I'm guessing so, as I can't imagine a UK TV show host knocking out of a bit of 'oh my golly gosh, goodness gracious me' while rolling his head in *Mind Your Language* style.

So what's up here? Are there not enough Chinese people to make this sort of thing a no-go, or do people not care? Chinese fair game, Indians not?

Between the two tours we've booked, we have a week in London, perfect opportunity to fulfill a long-held dream of mine and watch a Chelsea game in the flesh!

So I have a few questions I thought I could ask now, even though next year's fixtures aren't up yet:

1) How far in advance do tickets for each home game go on sale, &amp; how much do they usually cost? Say, for example, that the home game on while I'm in town is the 11th of January.

2) Do any of the locals from this subreddit usually meet up and go to the games together? Not many of my friends are football fans (and the two that are support Tottenham and Man Utd...) so I'd love to meet up at a pub and have a group to watch the game with. I'm sure I'll remember to make a post much much closer to the date, so we can organize something.

3) Is taking the Stamford Bridge tour worth it, and what sort of things do you get up to? Silly touristy question I know, I presume it's awesome, but just making sure.

However I recently got a job that I'll need to commute fairly regularly to that's about 90 miles away (though not everyday).  And involves perhaps 80% motorway 20% urban.

The car will only be used for commuting as we have a separate family car at home.  As such I'm looking for a balance of fuel economy (especially on motorways instead of town driving), with cost.  

So far I've had a good look at the Toyota Yaris T4 Hybrid which gets knocked a bit for power but seems satisfactory in terms of economy and features.  It's available on PCP (personal contract purchase) which would be my preferred way of buying a new car.

There's also a chance I'll end up driving into London a fair bit, hence the Yaris' low emissions (ie no congestiuon charge) making it more attractive than some other ""super minis"" that turned up while googling around.

Would welcome your thoughts!  What are your favourite economical commuting cars?

Thanks!

EDIT - A few extra details

- I've not driven long and not found ""smaller"" cars to be problematic.  (Probably don't know what I'm missing...)
- New car is preferred because I'm a schmuck for new gadgets and features..
- Low emissions is a biiig plus because I'll likely drive in to London on occasions (no congestion charge)
- Also important because it's a company purchase, and lower emission cars attract a lower ""benefit in kind"" charge
- The trip is more like 50% at speed 50% stop start, as such, fuel economy across both is equally important
- Fuel economy is a big must, partially to offset the expense of wanting a new car

* a 51-70 year old male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in England and has a bachelor’s degree or higher

* a 51-70 year old female who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in England and has no more than secondary education (college)

* a 31 - 50 female who lived at least the first 30 years of her life in England and has a bachelor's degree or more

* a 18 – 30 female who lives in England and has no more than secondary education

Also, I am looking for people from France and Germany,

For **France**, I'm looking for:

* a 70+ male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in France and has a bachelor's degree or more

* a 70+ female who lived at least the first 30 years of her life in France and has no more than Bac Pro

The interview could be done using Facebook chat, Google Plus or Skype.

The questions concern among other topics: personal biography, views on values and events, and the possible existence of perceived differences between people born in different cohorts.

MTCM: do you have a Tesco clubcard?

Me: no, I’ll use my Tesco credit card thanks. *Inserts card into money-taking machine thingymagic.*
MTCM: do you want to pay with this card?

Me: Oh. Erm. Well. Actually, you raise a good point. DO I want to pay with this card? I mean I thought I wanted to when I first arrived here, but now I am beginning to question whether this is the right decision now that you’ve raised it. I mean, I do have these two other cards here too *waves cards at MTCM.* And you see the thing is, although the Tesco card is usually my first choice for the wonderful clubcard points I receive quarterly, plus it’s a lovely shiny silver and shiny things are the best things in the world, these other two cards each have their benefits too. This one *waves pink credit card* is very pretty, pink is my favourite colour, and it’s interest free at the moment too. But on the other hand, I really really love this card too *waves silver credit card* - because not only is it silver and shiny, but because the Tesco card has strawberries on it too, this card has more surface area of silver, so it has EVEN MORE SHINY. 

Sir, I’m not sure what to do. This is quite the conundrum. I, errr – I’m not sure how I can come to a decision. Do you think you could help me please??

MTCM: madam, I would gladly assist you if I were able to, but I’m afraid it’s store policy that staff are not allowed to assist customers with regards to their purchasing methods. 

Me: why is that? That makes very little sense.

MTCM: well you see, if I were to advise you to pick your favourite shiniest card to use, and it turns out that you have forgotten you made a big purchase on it, it is possible that this transaction could take you over your limit and if your provider then charges you a fee for going over your credit card limit, you could sue Tesco for the fee you incur. I’m sure you can understand that litigation is an expensive process and I would not wish for our store to get unnecessary bad publicity as a result. In fact, this kind of madness could cost me my job.

Me: oh I see. Well I do like the idea of suing Tesco but I would never want to see a man lose his job. I don’t THINK I’ve made any big purchases on it, but then again, I may have just forgotten. It’s a bit of a risk I suppose. 

MTCM: madam, I realise that you are in a very awkward position right now, but I would kindly urge you to do your best to come to a decision as soon as possible. There are five customers in the queue now,  and the one at the front is struggling to keep the mucus flowing from her small child’s nose. The child needs to go home to bed.

Me: I’m sorry, I know, I don’t wish to inconvenience people, it’s just…. OH, hang on! I know how you can help me without getting into trouble!! Take these two cards and put them behind your back. Shuffle them around like you would do with cards, and then I just have to choose between your left and right hand!!

MTCM: that is a good plan madam, but it is against our rules to assist with these decisions in ANY manner.

Me: ummm. Well. I’m a bit stumped. 

My eyes shoot wide open. *Turns around to snot-kid lady.*

Me: excuse me, but do you think you could help me out here please? I am unable to chose which credit card to use for my purchase. Do you think you could shuffle them behind your back and then I’ll choose your left or right hand? I promise the card is clean and has never been anywhere grotty. And anyway, your kid is full of cold so you’re all germed up  to the eyeballs anyway.

Snot-kid lady: yes. Anything to get you out of the sodding queue – I’m going to miss the start of Eastenders at this rate.

*Card shuffle happens*. 

Now, which is my favourite arm, is it left or right? On the one hand, the nail polish is chipped on her left hand and I don ‘t really like that, but it does have a really shiny watch on it. Not only that, but the watch is embedded with (probably fake) diamonds, so it’s SUPER shiny. But can I allow myself to get over the state of those chipped nails? I’m not so sure.  I need to consider the right hand. Right, I need to take a deep breath here. Breaaaaaaaaathe. Here we go. Okay, the right hand nail varnish is even more chipped than the left, it looks revolting! How can she allow herself to be seen out in public in that state?? I just don’t understand people sometimes. OH.MY.DEAR.GOD.  She’s got a phone number written on the back of her hand in yellow pen. Yellow!!! She must’ve been visited by the devil in her sleep. Wow, I didn’t realise you could reach the devil on the phone. I just assumed you do something bad and he turns up in a puff of smoke like a genie. I wonder if it’s an iPhone?? I must remember to look on the app store when I get home for ‘iDevil.’ So the right hand isn’t in favour too much, but hang on, fuck me if that is not a REAL 1 carat diamond on the second to left finger. It has to be real, right? I swear I can feel the heat from the bling warming my face up. That could just be the most beautiful thing I have seen for at least a year, at LEAST.  But can I get past the yellow? I feel queasy just looking at it. 

MTCM: madam, I would urge you…

Me: right hand, right! Sorry sorry sorry, but it just has to be the right.   

*Woman rolls her eyes and passes me the pink credit card back*.

Oh. Well that’s a bit of a disappointment. I think I was hoping for the shiny silver card really. I must’ve been, my stomach just sunk a little bit.  

Me to snot-kid lady: I prefer the other card really, but that queue is getting extreme, so I’m going to go with it as people want to go home. 

*Inserts card into money taking machine doo-dah, enters pin and pays.* 

MTCM: thank you for shopping at Tesco, and enjoy the rest of your evening madam.

Me: I wish I could say that I really will do that, but I think I’m going to be worrying about this decision for a while yet – was it the right choice after all?

Snot-kid woman: lady, get the fuck out of the shop before you find yourself splattered on the floor. OUT. GET.OUT. *Raises and clenches right fist in my face.*

Me: sorry, sorry, I’m going, going – I’m gone! But just a sec, I know this is a bit cheeky but can I ask if that is a real diamond you’re wearing there? 

The next thing I know I wake up in a hospital bed, my head is bandaged and there’s a, whaddya call ‘em, pee pan under my bum. Dear god, it’s got wee in it too! I weed into a pee pot in a public place?? There are people less than six feet away from me – what if they heard me?? What if they can SMELL IT?  OH.MY.DEAR.GOD.  I may just die of shame. 

Turns out she floored me and I cracked my head open on the side of the pile of metal shopping baskets. Over a credit card choice. Being indecisive can get you hospitalised now?? Blimey. Eastender’s must’ve ended on a right cliffhanger last week. 

*imaginary obviously, but god damn it one of these days I WILL make this conversation happen. And yeah, it’s only one guy – same dude every time.

These guys are pretty old fashioned and unfortunately rather sexist, they get the girls to do all the menial jobs where the men do the better ones. 

Its starting to get to her a bit and i wonder if there's anything that can be done about this.

How would you go about approaching this subject with these men?

For my master’s thesis, I'm looking for people from France and Germany who spent at least the first thirty years of their life in France or Germany, understand and speak English, and are willing to be interviewed (for people under 30, they should've spent most of their lives France). The subject of the thesis, summarized in one question: “What was/is growing up (and older) like for people of your age?”

For **France**, I'm looking for:

* a 70+ male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in France and has a bachelor's degree or more

* a 70+ female who lived at least the first 30 years of her life in France and has no more than Bac Pro

* a 51-70 year old male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in France and has no more than Bac Pro

* a 31 – 50 female who lived at least the first 30 years of her life in France and has no more than Bac Pro

For **Germany**, I'm looking for:

* a 70+ male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in Germany and has no more than Abitur/Berufsschule

* a 31-50 female who lived at least the first 30 years of her life in Germany and has no more than Abitur/Berufsschule

Also, I am looking for people from **England**. See the following:

* a 70+ male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in England and has a bachelor's degree or more

* a 51-70 year old male who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in England and has a bachelor’s degree or higher

* a 51-70 year old female who lived at least the first 30 years of his life in England and has no more than secondary education (college)

* a 31 - 50 female who lived at least the first 30 years of her life in England and has a bachelor's degree or more

* a 18 – 30 female who lives in England and has no more than secondary education

The interview could be done using Facebook chat, Google Plus or Skype.

The questions concern among other topics: personal biography, views on values and events, and the possible existence of perceived differences between people born in different cohorts.

If they'd have taken full points from three of the other four - the remaining match was against Manchester City - they would be second in the league now, six points behind Manchester United. 
As it is, they stumbled against lesser teams and are 13 points adrift of the leaders.

[Picture](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/01/18/article-0-16FB89CD000005DC-785_634x528.jpg)

Stamford Bridge has become a difficult place for Chelsea to win and it is largely down to the horrible atmosphere.
Supporters decided they didn't want to support Benitez from the moment he was appointed and their negativity is clearly affecting the players.
There is booing, there is the Frank Lampard farewell roadshow and the hounding of Fernando Torres. That is distracting for the players on the pitch. Trying to play a game while the fans sing for someone who is on the bench or the former manager does nothing for your confidence.
You think 'the fans want Lampard, not me' and what you're doing on the pitch feels like a sideshow. When going to Stoke is a welcome relief, you know there is something wrong.
The club has become a sorry mess and a laughing stock. Chelsea may not l ike Benitez but he is a good manager. He's won the Champions League, league titles in Spain with Valencia and made Liverpool as strong as they've been in the Premier League.

[Chelsea managers first 5 Premier League home games](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/01/18/article-0-1705CECD000005DC-54_634x713.jpg)

He is dealing with a very difficult situation in a very mature way too. As well as being stuck between the fans and the board over Lampard, he also has Ashley Cole leaving at the end of the season, which is an awkward situation as I'm sure the fans and Cole will feel he could have played on for a few more years. Benitez wants to give everything to the club and he deserves an element of respect.
He's swimming against the tide and whatever he does i s pounced on. Contrast it with Manchester United, who made 10 changes for their FA Cup tie with West Ham - Robin van Persie wasn't playing - and there was no booing.
There's a trust and belief in Sir Alex Ferguson
If Jose Mourinho was making the decisions Benitez is, he wouldn't be booed. It is getting Chelsea nowhere. They need to draw a line under the appointment and support the team. They are achieving nothing at the moment. Maybe Arsenal coming to Stamford Bridge tomorrow will help galvanise the fans. It means the pantomime can be put to one side. It needs to stop if they want to stay in the top four. As it stands, I'm sure Everton, Tottenham and Arsenal are delighted.

At first it was always that I would take Liverpool and within two years turn them into champions that are way better than any other team in the game. This is great because it shows how close we are in real life but thats too short for me, and its no fun if I'm winning all the time. So I decided to take a bad team and try to bring them to the top but the problem with that is that I don't like the team I chose, so I will start getting bored or dislike it because, well... its not Liverpool. So I came up with this crazy idea, I could make Liverpool really bad and then build them up from the bottom back to the top, like ol' Bill. Then I got to thinking of how to do this and realized my idea was going to be tougher than I thought. As of right now the plan is to start with the current team, sell of everyone that is above a 65 overall and start purchasing low overall guys to replace. Also I'm going to buy scouts to drain all of my transfer money, to where I'm close to zero. Then simulate it out for a couple years until I'm in the npower league 2 and successfully the worst team and, then begin my return to the top. The problem is it is really time consuming and I didn't want to get into it all until I was able to chck with others to see if there might be an easier way to do it.

I might be studying next year at UoP. I'm trying to figure out what the living costs for a foreign student might be, and for that [I'm using this website](http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/portsmouth). Is this correct? I'm not sure how reliable this info is, since I don't live in the UK. 

I was wondering if r/Portsmouth would agree with the data on this site or if anyone would like to add some tips!

**edit**: Thank you, everyone :) Coming from a totally overpopulated city, Portsmouth does sound like a very nice place to live at. Now all I need to know is how on Earth I'm gonna afford it.

All sense of national pride (albeit being prevalent during the Olympics) ceases to exist - it makes me cringe to say 'I'm British'.

What exactly do I have to be proud of?

A country that gets it's healthcare services *raped* clean by those who have been in the country for five minutes, who haven't been paying towards it's maintenance or paying towards our taxes for years on end?

I can see the argument for it being great that we're a *multicultural* United Kingdom, but I have yet to see all cultures united in a sense of common 'Pride' for our nation. 
I only really have experience of living in London and Southampton and I'm of the opinion that whilst these cultures exist side-by-side, that's really all they do.

I've seen no sense of community, no sense of cultures working together and especially no common 'Pride' to be living in the UK.

It pains me to say it, but this wouldn't happen in the USA.
People are actually proud to be American...(a weak example, admittedly)

So if anyone elseis interested how many subscribers there are within each area sub-reddit in **England** (Sorry everyone else) here they are ranked by subscriber count.  The full list follows, but first, the top 10:

  1. London (14110)
  2. London Social Club (3736)
  3. Manchester (2231)
  4. Bristol (1328)
  5. Leeds (994)
  6. Brighton (935)
  7. Liverpool (904)
  8. Newcastle-upon-Tyne (798)
  9. Sheffield (782)
  10. Oxford (729)

Anyway, the full list (and I suppose this also counts as a 'hey, these exist! type post') for your perusal.  By the by, I'm loving Swindon's 'XX people in Swindon with access to a computer' as their subscriber title. within within.  

Obviously if you know of any that are missing, add them to the wiki page (some of the links here may fail as I messed about a bit to get the counts, so let me know if there are any issues...) Counts are as correct as I can get them as of now and subject to change and errors if I did something silly.

**LFCmatchday and ElevenReds MOTM:** Henderson and Gerrard

*'Why 2 players?'* because I can and they deserve it. 

Just when you think Henderson will never be the player he was tipped to be he produces brilliance that leaves you astounded. Just when you think Gerrard is past it, he reminds you why he was once considered to be the best attacking midfielder in the world. Both linked up incredibly well with one another today and were the engine of our attack, their passing both precise and intelligent opened up the Norwich defense and allowed us to take complete control of the game.

Henderson's goal was nothing short of brilliant and it gave him a much needed confidence boost which visibly saw him become much more daring and comfortable with the ball. Gerrard also got a goal and looked dangerous with the ball 30 yards outside the box and his cutting paces allowed Suarez and Sturridge to punish Norwich.

So much pressure on our goal and our inability to keep possession had to eventually bear fruit for West Ham. They had previously been beset by injury, unfortunately for QPR almost all Hammers' players were available for selection.

Positives:

* QPR are unbeaten in 2013.

* Remi scored.

* Another fine defensive display from QPR.

* Wright-Philips looks more confident with each game.

* We're only 5 points away from escaping relegation.

* This year we've been gaining points at an average of 2 per game.

It really would have made things a lot easier if we'd got a win today. We have 15 points and must get around 37-38 points, in total, to stay up. With 15 games left, we need an average of 1.53333 points per game.

**If we had been playing all season as we have been this year, we would finish the season with 76 points and 3rd position in the league.** We are now achieving the top-6 performance Harry said we need to survive.

Aside from the Man U game, I see lots of opportunities for wins in March, with perhaps a win or 2 if we are fortunate in February. 7 wins should see us safe.",false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,null,null,self,West Ham 1-1 QPR: Post-match thoughts,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/16vrtz/west_ham_11_qpr_postmatch_thoughts/

several differences are starting to make me worried though:

- the adviser wants me to login to my email address to make sure I've been applying for stuff i wrote on my job list. The only problem is not all of my applications are through email so I'm worried not enough applications are verifiable.

- I've been put on a very basic IT course (how to use emails/word, etc) and several sessions of supervised job searching. I don't mind free advice but if anything this will be in the way of my actual job search.

- in my recent job search i found slightly more jobs than required, but was told i need to pick up the pace. this worries me because sometimes there are barely enough eligible jobs for even the minimum but now i'm being told to apply for more.

Can I have any advice on my rights in this situation? Can the adviser force me to provide evidence of my job search (besides the basic job list)? Can I refuse to take part in basic courses?

BR's tactics this game were really interesting. I've been going around this subreddit telling anyone and everyone that Suarez would be a great #10/CAM but also how it wouldn't happen. Yes i know that on paper, Suarez was on the wing, but the majority of the match he was sitting drifting around the middle behind Sturridge. The number of times he was in our own half pressing proved (to me) that Rodgers intended for him to play midfield. soooo pleasantly surprised to see that Rodgers set him up there. Suarez was great on the press and always showed for the ball. 

The thing that I found most interesting was that Hendo was still on the field. I usually think in traditional terms of having 2 wide men, but BR chose to stack the midfield and we ended up playing 4-4-2 for a majority of the match. However it felt more like a 3-4-3 the way Johnson was playing! 

Anyways, BR is a genius and we are starting to see what he meant when he said that he'd adjust tactics to the players he's got. With Swansea, he player 2 winger/forwards because they had great ones in Sinclair and Dyer. However we lack depth out wide and instead have it in the midfield. So what does Rodgers do? Stacks the midfield. This made for a HUGE improvement in our buildup and for once it finally looked controlled instead of rushed. Also possession stayed mostly within the opponents half (i think stats will show this later) which was made possible by having 4 players in the center rather than 3. Agger got so bored that he ended up making a couple great runs where he usually only does that once a game. Towards the middle of the second half the midfield was running so smooth that Suarez didn't even have to play centrally and ended up playing the front line again where he got his deserved goal. 

this felt like the formation:

--------------Jones-----------------

Wisdom---Carra--Agger----Johnson
 
-------------Lucas----------------

---Hendo-----------Gerrard---------

----------------Suarez---------------

Downing------Sturridge------------

Going forward, I hope to see this same asymmetrical 4-4-2 to start games. then as the opponents get worn down switch back and forth with a 4-3-3. 

anyways, ecstatic over todays game. I feel like Rodgers may swap Downing for Borini in a few matches when Borini shakes off his rust. 

Little note on Downing. People probably loved him this game. and they should because he was solid and had a great assist. I still have some problems with his game. His defensive positioning is still woeful and he holds on to the ball too long. When the ball goes out wide to Sterling he already knows whether or not he will try to take his defender. Usually he makes the smart choice and does not. So with Sterling, its a touch and then a pass back to Glen immediately. Downing slows the play a bit and takes more time to think, allowing the defense to do the same. This is coachable..maybe Rodgers will address it during training for next match.

My personal view is that Benitez is not a good manager, has no attachment to Chelsea or its fans, and wants success only for himself. He lives in a dream world where he blocks out anything from the outside and he will never be the man for us.

Having said that, I also think it is possible for me to cheer the team and support them, even if I don't want Benitez as manager. The opinions on this sub are more pro Benitez than at Stamford Bridge, and I can understand that people who watch the games on TV or whatever feel more attached to the players and the results, than they do to the football club itself and what it represents. They want to see Chelsea players scoring and whatever else is going on behind the scenes doesn't really bother them. I mean Christ, I even saw someone on here post a Martin Keown 'article' urging us to support Benitez, since when did we Chelsea fans do what Martin fucking Keown says?!

So I'll leave it on this note because I don't want to keep having pissing contests with some of these other 'fans' of the club. If you want to support Benitez, go to Stamford Bridge on a match day and start telling everyone there about how 'important' it is to back him. Start up a song about how great he is and see what reaction you get. People who have given me shit for not getting behind Rafa, see who the rest of Stamford Bridge agrees with on your annual visit. 

Apologies to to anyone swept up in generalisations, I know that not everyone has been swept up in this pro-Rafa stuff that easily. I welcome any feedback on this, but please make it more elaborate than 'you are a shitty fan wtf!/ back rafa!'.

Today I feel like I don’t have a partner.  
I said goodbye to my only friends  
In the city we ran in  
The city of angels.  
And I’ll never see them, as hard as I try.  

I walked through the streets with  
My lovely companion.  
I walked with my wife who  
Still knows who I am.  
But all my good deeds were  
Rewarded with cruelty.  
But I’ll never mourn them  
Now that is a lie.

I don’t ever want to feel  
Like I did that day.  
Going up above the clouds  
To lock myself away.  
I don’t ever want to feel  
Like I did that day.  
And I’m not gonna come back down  
No matter what you say.  
 
*It’s hard to believe, but  
The Doctor is out there.  
Though he won’t admit it,  
We still aren’t alone.*

*The Doctor’s in grief from   
The city of Amy,  
But say the right word and  
He’ll come back around.*  

I don’t ever want to feel  
Like I did that day.  
Won’t let myself become involved  
So I won’t have to stay.  
I don’t ever want to feel  
Like I did that day.  
But I’ll come back to Earth to help  
To fight the snow away.

Running away through time  
So I’ll escape my pain.  
Running away through time  
Won’t go through that again.  
Running away through time  
But now I have an aim.  
Running away through time

Sneijder Already is world class, but his presence in the side would hinder Jordan's chances of evolving into the player he could be, especially with our Captain in such fine form, and Lucas' name on the team sheet inevitable. 

Hendo showed today exactly the sort of technical prowess we would be expecting from Sneijder, for example:

His incredible half volley to go 1 - 0 up. 

His even more impressively hit, but less accurate shot a few minutes later. 

His pinpoint pass to Downing for Sturridge's goal. 


Do we want to sacrifice having a potentially world class player in the future, who I believe will be our next captain is he keeps this form up, and continues to improve, and influence play as he did today.

or do we want the quick fix in Sneijder? 

If I was Brendan Rodgers, and I knew my plan, and philosophy, I'd go with Henderson. 


If we spent the money/wages on bringing in someone world class/(or there about) to take Downing's place, we would have a complete starting 11 in my opinion. 

Opinions?

There is SO many Doctor Who things to buy so the help is needed with finding things that fit this criteria:
1) Under $30 (Or around if it's really good, but try to keep it under. And not including shipping since I know a lot of stuff comes from the UK. I'm in the USA)

2) Not Complete Junk; I don't want it falling apart in a week.

3) Preferably 11&amp;River themed stuff, as opposed to 9/10&amp;Rose. 

4)4's Scarf, Sonic Screwdrivers and River's Journal will not work. We already possess these. 

5) Gifts that can be made or bought and then tweaked to feel like a Doctor Who item are acceptable.

But this is all just make belief anyway, so grant me just that.  

The Doctor loses his hand during the battle with the daleks in season 1, and that's how Jack finds it (in the battle field) upon reviving, using it to eventually find the Doctor.  

Near the end of season 4, Donna would have regenerated the *ninth* doctor as a clone rather than the 10th, resulting in a *hilarious* ""Who are you?"" ""I'm the Doctor!"" ""No you're not!"" moment. Only for the 9th to have the exact same conversation with the 10th Doctor shortly after (with the roles reversed).

Finally at the end, Rose would be left to the alternate universe with the 9th doctor rather than the clone of the 10th. That way it wouldn't have felt like Rose was being dumped with a clone reject, but rather the good old 9th. Because honestly, those two had way more chemistry together than with the 10th; Not to mention that they'd gone through so much more together. Rose sacrificed her life to save the 9th's and vice versa.  

Anyway, that's my take on a better season finale. What d'you guys think?

I think the preferred and expected lineup would be the 4-2-3-1 with 

 ------------------Hugo--------------

Walker----Daws/Caulker---Jan----BAE

------Scotty P--------Dembele-------

Azza----------Dempsey----------Bale

---------------Defoe----------------

This will obviously be a very tough game, but it also comes at a time where we can separate from the rest of the table chasing the top 4. A victory would be massive, a draw would be alright as one of chelsea arsenal will drop points, a loss not a disaster but would be disappointing to see obviously.

Tactics wise, I think Vertonghen and Daws/Caulker being able to suffocate van Persie is a big time focal point. Sandro will be missed greatly for his ability to absolutely blow up Man U's attacking play, but Scotty P has all of our full confidence and will have a big role to play sitting on Rooney. From there, expect to either see us play the fast counter, The BAE-Bale combo could be big in that; Or we attempt to control the game through Dembele tearing up their midfield (again) that lacks a bona-fide DM.

I believe a new way forward for creating recons, is to apply this technique to the currently 'slide show' efforts. What do you think?

I just arrived this morning (and am horribly jetlagged, keep in mind), and I've already had some things pop up that I really thought I might ask to some regular UK citizens.

I understand that this is a very different culture, and I'm excited to get to know it and incorporate it over time. But I had this feeling of low self-confidence today while talking with some people, just buying food or other stuff. I feel like I'm at the social level of a 15 year old and I'm 21. It's a little embarrassing and I am wondering how long it might take me to adjust to the new conversational norms and customs.

I just feel like I'm second-guessing and overanalysing everything I do, which is counterproductive. I'm trying too hard. Any tips on how to adjust to the UK culture from the States? How much of my slang do I need to stop using? examples that got odd responses today: ""knock it out (get it done)"" and various other phrases and tactics that I've learned to use in America. I had to have the barista repeat himself (""Sittin'?"") about 3 times when I ordered a coffee...maybe it's no big deal to the Mancs, but I feel self-conscious.

How do you introduce yourself to people? I am good at the American way, which is fairly assertive and cheery, but I'm afraid to do the ""American"" way here. Again, thinking too much.

I think our national personification as Britannia (the woman with a trident next to libyan lion) is pretty cool, and I don't think it has as much royal connotation.

Soldering Is Easy!

Saturday 9th Feb, 11am and 3pm

BuildBrighton bring back our new and improved Drawdio+ synthesiser pencil kit for you to get your soldering-fu in action!

Soldering is an extremely useful skill, and one that's much easier than folk typically think. With our easy to assemble Drawdio kit, we'll take you through the various techniques you'll need to be a dab hand with a soldering iron &amp; multimeter.

The workshop lasts for 3 hours, and if you finish your Drawdio early we'll have plenty of other fun kit for you to play with.

£15, ages 12+ (must be with parent or guardian)

Make your own MP3 player

Saturday 16th Feb, 11am to 5pm

Make your own Arduino MP3 Player!

You’ve got the latest phone, with super-slim design, 4G broadband internet and online video streaming support with all the latest apps and gizmos. What gadget could possibly be cooler? Well how about making your very own music player?

In this five hour workshop we’ll get a freshly soldered audio board actually playing songs and music that have been stored on an external SD card. Using the Arduino platform, we’ll be adding a simple character-based LCD and buttons so you can make your very own portable mp3 audio player. Now what could be cooler than that?

£50 with own Arduino kit, £75 including our Arduino starter kit. Ages 12+ (with parent or guardian). All equipment and components provided.

Mmmm Pi! Get your Raspberry Pi talking to the world

Sunday 17th Feb, 11am to 5pm

The Raspberry Pi has been hailed as the next big thing in so many ways - programming in schools, hobby robotics, even taking photos from the edge of space! But just how do you get it talking to the world around it?

This five hour workshop will take you through getting your Pi connected to a whole manner of electronics: temperature sensors, motor controllers, light detectors - and then report all this info out to Twitter &amp; it's own wee website!

All equipment and components will be provided, including a prototyping shield to make it easy to add custom electronics and wiring.

£50 with own Pi, £85 including a full Pi kit. Ages 12+ (with parent or guardian)

However, when the topic of foxhunting arises in almost any context, the response usually tends to be the same. 

People opposing it smash down upon hunters with a shitstorm of frankly samey opinions. Said opinions rarely deviate from the hunt being cruel. Such cruelty is argued against and validly supported by a range of reasons, but numbers usually seem to win the fight over reason.

I tire of these arguements occasionly arising only to be smitten by numbers which lead to no sort of conclusion, maybe a conclusion insn't something that will arise from such a vast crowd but being far from one is hardly any better.

If something could go well that would be great. I do not intend to insult, maybe an education can be drawn, as that is what most tend to lack over the divide between rural living and urban.

There is a reason these animals were hunted for centuries and managed to be done so sustainably. It is someones' entertainment from a meaningful task and provides income for many a more. So why do so many hate it so much?

I realise this is more than likley to be a fairly long shot but i reckon that a lot could benefit from a bit more knowledge.

Make a point, what side are you on?

Try to remain vaguley friendly and dont start scratching as such usually happens and tires the argument.

Admit valid knowledge, there are definatley those with more contact to certain topic areas.

They'll tell you to hang up the call and try to call someone else, they say they'll temporarily disconnect your line and that you won't be able to place another call (having hung up on the scammer). What they use is the fact that the initiator of a call is the only one who can end the connection. They put their end of the call on mute, then when you hang up you can't see or hear it, but you're still on the line to the scammer. You can try to call someone else, but you won't get a dialing tone or be able to connect.

The scammer can also hear you trying to dial, and can hear your voice if you speak into the handset. They then know when you've tried and failed, so they hang up and call you back to say that this is proof they're from BT, so gimme credit card details.

I'd wanted to get involved in european soccer since the late '90s, but without an excuse to root for anyone, every game I watched felt distant and unemotional. All I needed was an excuse, any excuse, to pick a team for life.

Then FSG bought Liverpool. I was ecstatic. As a lifelong Red Sox fan, it was all the excuse I needed. I said to myself, ""This is it. From this day forth I am a Liverpool supporter and there is no looking back.""

I went absolutely nuts. I watched documentaries on Liverpool's history, highlight reels on every great Liverpool player, and I rewatched all the classic games the internet would give me. I've watched every single Liverpool game since around Hodgson's last few months which is not long, I know, but it's to the point now where I know and care more about Liverpool than my other teams, having never been to Anfield in my life.

If anyone is interested, I can tell you what it's like having followed these owners closely for 11 years in case anyone wants to know how they tend to operate and how they look at new signings, etc.

Over 23 games Spurs have 40 goals from 424 Shots, or 10.6 Shots per goal

* United 57 goals from 353 = 6.2 Shots per goal
* Arse 41 goal from 324 = 7.9 Shots per goal
* READING!! 28 Goals from 229 = 8.2 Shots per goal

Reading are taking 2 less shots than us in order to score... let that sink in for a bit coz they're probably being relegated this season.
We're actually 2nd in the league in shots per game, so we're creating chances, we're just not putting them in the back of the net. Only 8 teams have a worse Shots/Goal ratio than us.

If we were as efficient as Reading, we'd have approx 12 more goals, if were were as efficient as the arse we'd have an extra 14 more goals, and we were as clinical as United, we'd be sitting on 68 goals (28 more than we have)

Sure these stats don't show the full picture as we could be taking 75% of our shots from outside the box at impossible angles, but the fact is the boys are getting into positions where they think they can have a pop, but either they're not making the right decisions, or they're not good enough to execute. We need a striker/s who are better at both of these things.

Just as an aside, as much as people hate him, Berba takes 7 shots to score a goal, Demba Ba is around 6.8, (both of which we could of brought in for next to nothing) while Defoe's at 9.4.

How did it go? What improvements would you make next time? Would you reduce the number of teams? How do you guys feel about an online qualifier? And whatever else you want to add.

There are adjustments and improvements that will definitively will be made next time, such as having a set of rules for issues like tiebreakers for example.

I've been working my way through new Who for a couple of months(would have been faster but I've been stubborn about moving on to new Doctors). I've done 9, 10, most of Torchwood, about half of Sarah Jane Chronicles, 8 and I'm just over a season into 11.



**The problem:** The links in the FAQ of this sub for the [episode guide](/http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/fy6g0/episode_guide_people_here_keep_asking_which_order/) doesn't match up with the [minisode guide](/http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/10klcl/list_of_doctor_who_miniepisodes/). 

And then there's the whole tracking down the bits Netflix doesn't have, but that just takes paying attention to the episode names and seasons and having an accurate guide to go by.

I've noticed this in a few places, but right now I'm wondering if I watch ""Bad Night"" before ""The Doctor's Wife"" as the minisode guide suggests or wait until I get to the end of the season as the episode guide suggests. Or does it matter in the slightest?

Perhaps adding air dates and Doctor numbers to the episode guide would help? I'm not a procrastinating student or in a job with loads of free time anymore so I don't have the time (or honestly the Who background) to research that bit.

*The word on the street*,

-------------

* **[My, O' My, Galatasaray](http://i.imgur.com/SJHJmXd.jpg)**

[So we didn't get him..](http://i.imgur.com/8zr5cn9.gif)

Despite all the speculation and Gerrard saying publicly he'd like him at Liverpool the hunt for Sneijder is over.

Sneidjers reason for choosing Galatasaray over us was that he wanted to compete for trophies (although we all know that Gal were willing to pay him more) LFC fans weren't too upset but it's widely agreed that Sneijder could have [worded his explanation better..](http://i.imgur.com/xDXBl.jpg)

* **[BR to buy Brazilian Boy from Italians because of his ball control](http://i.imgur.com/Cnx6mWg.jpg)**

Philippe Coutinho, the 20 year old Brazilian wonder boy is [reported to be on the verge of joining LFC from Inter.](http://i.imgur.com/uLj0u.gif)

Tipped to be a great future prospect, no one is surprised BR is keen to land the player keeping up with his buy young, buy cheap, buy for tomorrow policy, however Inter arnt willing to let their potential future star go so quickly and BR was said to be a little frustrated over the amount of time Coutinho asked for [so he 'could think about it'](http://i.imgur.com/QyazU.gif)

If this rumor turns out to be true and with new arrival Sturridge in beast mode, [everyone will no doubt be very impressed with BR.](http://i.imgur.com/bhNML.gif)

* **There's no place like Loan**

[...Offers have been made for Coates](http://i.imgur.com/dtPn9.gif)

Dont worry its only on loan! In a recent interview Coates said he's feeling frustrated at a lack of chances in the first team and a loan to Wigan could end up being a win - win as it'll give him the playing time and development he wants while we can continue to play our strongest team.

* **You may take our Lives, but you'll never take our FREEDOM!.. Oh but you can have Wilson**

Scottish Youngster Danny Wilson has also gone on loan, this time up north to Hearts. Although a lot of people believe this to be just an experience building loan a lot more speculate this could be the end of Wilson who [has failed to live up to expectations and break into the first team, time will tell](http://i.imgur.com/mhyqw.gif)

* **Tom Ince to stay Black^^pool**

The once sought after Blackpool players is quickly falling our of favor, as Blackpool continue to [hold out for a higher bid of 8-9m](http://i.imgur.com/XAXoe.gif) and our front 3 showing that they can work together the deal that some LFC fans were once begging for may all but be over. 

* **Long to Reina over us**

So this just in, Reina father has come out and said that his son would best be suited at Barcelona. 

Barcelona...yeaah, no.

* **Xabi to be back**

[Negotiations between Alonso and Madrid continue..](http://i.imgur.com/HHbfD.gif)

*In the News this week,*

--------------------------

* [**Gerrard gets praised at writers award**](http://assets2.lfcimages.com/uploads/_jm_1523.jpg)

Deservedly so and long over due Gerrard received an award from the Football writers association for his contributions to football. Among the praise and the question about his long storied career one writer how does he feel the Champions league football compares to the Europa league [to which Gerrard responded..](http://i.imgur.com/jTu2h.gif)

* **Fabio is fabiolous**

Fabio Borini this week stated that despite his injury his Liverpool Career starts now. The 21 year old Italian was BR first buy at LFC but was quickly out of action after breaking his foot on international duty, leaving a lot of fans with the feeling our new young star was [going to be another Liverpool flop](http://i.imgur.com/8knWs.gif)

Thankfully Luis Suarez stepped his game and didn't get injured and in his most recent game, Fabio proved he was back and came painfully close to scoring, [he's back dear friends, he's back.](http://i.imgur.com/fPihK.gif)

* **Norwich to press abuse charges against Liverpool**

[Liverpool smashed Norwich 5-0...](http://i.imgur.com/8zFXS.gif)

while Suarez did what he does best and ripped the defense to pieces it was the work of Sturridge that surprised everyone. The new arrival scored and is now on 3 goal in 3 appearances for the reds and a lot of the doubters that were worried that Daniel wasn't the player we needed now consider him to be [the perfect accomplice to our current gunslinger Suarez](http://i.imgur.com/UoNKn.gif) 

* **Hendo goal the best thing since Borini's pizza**

Henderson form recently has been phenomenal! His volly against Norwich [left a lot of people in disbelief](http://i.minus.com/ibydpDUXpX4sU5.gif)

Despite a lot of fans thinking he would never live up to the hype, the England u21 captain is quickly making a reputation for himself as a reliable game changer and a possible future captain contender.

* **Downing on the Up and up**

Well fuck me..he's certainly winning a lot of people over.

Despite still being a major flop in terms of contribution he's certainly putting in more of an effort to go out on a high but a lot of fans still think he'll be best off else where. [A lot of people are asking what the fuck took him so long](http://i.imgur.com/GQQGc.gif)

This would have marked my 7th month here on this subreddit and the 10th Edition of YNWSA, many had hoped I would die and this thread would disappear like the Joe Cole supporters club but still after all this time [my feelings of your guys remain the same..](http://i.imgur.com/s77Ye.gif?1)

Stay Awesome.

I want to be as organised and together as possible so I have a few questions.

I'll put some relevant information here. I currently work as an apprentice so a jolly old £2.65 p/h wage for me, my girlfriend is unemployed but is doing every effort for a job, (we're not moving until she has a job) my other friend is a web developer getting £1000 a month on average, while the other I'm not so sure about but insists she has enough.
We've set a maximum rent of £700 a month, preferably in a central location such as the city centre, or outskirts of the city centre.

I'm wondering the following:

1) Is it possible for us to have 4 adults living under one roof by law?
2) Is our goal currently realistic?
3) What are the usual cost of bills, aside from rent?
4) Is there anything we should be prepared for?

Any information will go a long way! Thanks!

So: anyone up for some drinks mid-week? Say, on a Tuesday or Wednesday (perhaps the 29th or 30th or sometime in early Feb)?

edit: Thursday would work, too! Whatever works best for the largest amount of people.. so far there are one Wednesday vote, one Tuesday vote, and one Thursday vote. Assuming that this'll go down the week for the 27th, please weigh in with preferences :)

Also, I'm not local and am therefore kind of useless at choosing a venue. Suggestions welcome!

edit2: As recommended, I'm going to post the different days in question in the thread - with a show of upvotes please let me know which works best for you! Even if you're without preference it'd be helpful if you upvoted one :)

**edit3: It looks like Thursday is the popular choice! Right, the 31st it is. In a (crap) turn of events, my work schedule has been changed and I'm meant to be working that night, but I'm going to try my best to give the shift away (or failing that, to get away as early as possible and come straight to the meetup). Lots of folks expressed interest in food beforehand, so how about Illegal Jack's around 7? Google maps tells me that The Golf Tavern is just a short walk away, so how does that sound for the pub? I'll call and let them know to set aside a couple of the tables upstairs for us for 830ish, if that's cool. Let me know if anyone has issues with the time or either of the places chosen.**

 [EPL Table 2011-2012](http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2011-2012/table/2012-02-01)

Notice that Arsenal were only 3 points ahead of where we are as of this time last year, and they managed a magical run that saw them finish 3rd in the EPL on 70 points. 

One of the main contrasts to last year however is the point differential between the places on the table. Looking at last years there was a staggering 7 point difference between 7th and 8th place, where as today the 7 point differential spreads between 6th and 12th place, suggesting a more even playing field in the mid to upper table.  

In terms of this years points total, if we had 34 points last season it only would of had us in 8th, 3 points behind 7th. As of today we are level on points with 6th place Arsenal, and are only 11 points off of 3rd, whereas arsenal were 12 points off of third last year. 

The only point differential that is going a bit against us this year, is that between us and 4th. Last year there were only 5 points between 4th and 7th, where as right now that spread is 7. 

Realistically I can only assume that our current form will continue to improve, and baring the same end of season run we had last year where we only managed 18 points in 15 games, we should manage to end up somewhere around the 5-8th place mark, which would satisfy me just fine for BR's first year in charge. However, it is entirely possible based purely on number comparisons that we manage to sneak in a champions league spot. We also have a few things going for us so far, we already have the same amount of home wins as in the entirety of last season, and our goal differential is already 5 better than last year (our goal differential was +7 in week 23, and week 38 last year... also the Norwich win may of helped a bit in the goal differential this year!)

Let's just hope we manage to keep it up!!! I realize this may be a bit optimistic, and from my own view there is no expectation of 4th this year, so merely finishing 8th or above would satisfy me. However, I do believe to keep our top players we must continue to improve and at least fight and believe 4th is obtainable.

I know I need to Register within 3 months but don't know much more!

I would prefer that my current employer doesn't know about my freelance. On my contract doesn't say anything about exclusivity, I just dont feel comfortable with them knowing.

The government is saying this is fine, the privatisation was a good idea and it's much better than British Rail. The rail companies are saying they only make a ""modest profit"" and they provide great value for money. Meanwhile customers are complaining about how expensive it is to take the train while being reliably late every time and overcrowded much of the time.

I've only been in the UK for 8 years now, so I don't know what BR was like. But I do know that I have to spend much more on rail travel now than I did so many years ago and trains haven't got any faster or more on time or less crowded.
**EDIT:** I should note that in my 8 years here I've not seen *any* new trains on my journeys at all, so it doesn't seem like there has been any investment in faster/more comfortable trains in my time here, although I appreciate that these trains cost a lot and should last a long time before being replaced.

Kick-off is at 19:45 GMT / 14:45 EST / 11:45 PST.

Chelsea face an uphill battle as they are down 2-0 on aggregate, with Swansea having two away goals. We'll need to score twice to force extra time I believe, but if we score more than two goals in the second leg and the aggregate score is tied (after extra time), we will advance on away goals, so there's that.

One day around Christmas I was getting ready to watch Invasion of the Dinosaurs (which had been bought for me as a present) and my sister, having been kicked out of her own room as my grandparents were staying, came in to my room with nothing else to do. I started up Invasion of the Dinosaurs and she sat flicking around on her phone. I caught her looking up at the screen for the first 20 minutes or so but thought nothing of it. After around 30 minutes her phone had disappeared and she was glued to the screen. Even when she went down for a cigarette she insisted that I pause it so she didn't miss anything. I was amazed! After we had finished the entire thing she requested that we watch another one so I pulled out Revenge of the Cybermen and we sat and watched.

Even if we had not scored I think that the last twenty minutes of the game, when we are normally are on the other side of the attack and backed up in our own half showed a shift in mentality and our dedication and application of that mentality--and not in the bullshit feel-good way that AVB talks about in his press conferences after we lose.

I went into the whole thing reallllllyyyy wanting the UCL program.  It's in central London, a very small and competitive program, and they set you up with a mandatory internship at a London-area museum.  I was soooooo psyched when I was accepted to the program.  But, during the whole application process, I threw out an application to Oxford for their Visual, Material, and Museum Anthropology program.    

...and then, today, I got in. To Oxford.

The program is way more theoretical than I thought I'd want but now I'm confused.  EVERYONE is telling me to go to Oxford (name, connections, reputation) but my original gut reaction was UCL.  Never having been to visit either and being from the US, I'm relatively lost.

Okay Whovians.

On April 23rd, the day that ‘The Impossible Astronaut’ first aired, we are all going to draw tally marks on our arms and hands. I don’t care what your family says, I don’t care what your boyfriend says. (Why are you dating a non-Whovian?). This is a thing we are doing, and it’s going to be awesome. No matter where you are in the world we HAVE to do this. Invite all of your Whovian friends to join you. Lets get the biggest attendance for this. Make sure to take pictures of your arms and hands just covered in tally marks and post them on the wall. If you have an Instagram tag them #DWSilenceDay and lets try to get #DWSilenceDay trending on Twitter. Lets spook out the world. TOGETHER WE CAN DO THIS ~The Woman Twice Dead

The problem being that I'm completely broke at the moment, and being out of work due to mental health problems. The doctor said to ask at reception for some help, which sounded fair enough.

I asked at the reception and they pretty much said there's no way for me to get the prescription I needed, I'd just have to wait until it got bad enough to go to A&amp;E and they'd have to give me something on the spot rather than admistered by a pharmacy.

It's worth noting that I'm not eligable for any financial support after spending 6 months of last year trying to argue with incompetant people. Even with the recommendation of 2 different doctors, including the mental health lead of my county, apparently the opinion of non-trained people in an office out-weigh people with decades of training and experience.

So can anyone recommend any must visit places?  
  
To help narrow the search, here's the kinds of things we'd like in a town (It doesn't need to have all of these things but a few would be nice.)  
Nice, quiet, friendly pubs.  
A castle (or ruins or a fort. Something like that.)  
A farmers or food market.  
Nice gardens that we can walk around.  
Nice little thatch roofed houses to look at.  
Something touristy to do if we fancy it.  
Medieval architecture.  
Reasonably priced hotel.  

We live in Cheshire, so the closer the better but we'd drive anywhere really.
  
Know anywhere that fits the bill?  
  
Cheers!

Edit:  
  
Some great suggestions. Thank you everyone!  
So far my list of places to go in the near future looks like this: York, The Cotswalds, Durham, Robin Hood Bay, Nottingham, Berwick Upon Tweed and Pickering.  
I'm also going to be keeping an eye on the National Trust Free Weekend page that mr_happy28 linked to.
Special mention goes to Warwick too, I went to Warwick a few years ago at Halloween to go to the castle. It's actually the model for everything I mentioned above since we both loved the town so much.

What I found out just recently was that almost every culture on earth has a game; ""Grandmother's Footsteps"", or ""Redlight, Greenlight"" in the US. The game is strikingly similar to what the angels do (freeze when seen, approach the victim when not seen). Guess what, it's not just a game for us. It's also a game for many others, ranging from the Chinese to Poles.

This is important.  For the first time ever, a parliamentary enquiry is taking evidence from cycling experts on how to improve the UK's cycling facilities, so that we get more people cycling.

More cyclists on the roads equals fewer cars on the roads.  That means shorter and less frequent traffic jams, fewer obese children, a lower rate of associated illnesses such as heart disease.  Cities, towns and streets designed for **people** and not cars are nicer places to be in.

This is something that everyone should be on board with.  Imagine no more school rush, no stupid traffic jams as legions of fat parents vie for road space to drop their little darlings off right outside the school gates.  Imagine hundreds of children cycling in perfect safety from their front door to school, and back.  Imagine not needing a car any more, being able to do just about everything you once did, but on a bicycle.  Thousands of pounds of annual motoring costs spent instead on home improvements, holidays, socialising, gaming, etc.  No more having to breathe quite so much diesel and petrol fumes.  Less of the roar of air from car tyres as they zoom over the asphalt roads that cost so much to maintain.

To me, it's a no-brainer.  We need a revolution in this country.  We need to do what the Dutch did decades ago, and stop designing our streets for cars.  Pavements should continue across junctions with minor roads, so that pedestrians have priority.  Road space should be re-allocated to cyclists and pedestrians.  Businesses should have places to park bicycles.  Our high streets should depend not on people in cars passing through, but people on bicycles stopping to peruse (a bicycle is much, much easier to find space for than a car).

Cycling is fucking brilliant, I love it, always have, always will.  We need to change our country so that those who'd love to cycle, but are too frightened to do so, can take it up in absolute confidence.  We need cycle facilities that you'd let your 8-year-old child use.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,'Get Britain Cycling' inquiry examines cycling strategy,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/174f5r/get_britain_cycling_inquiry_examines_cycling/

Long story short, I fell in love with bales style of attacking with his intense pace and just how his power to affect a game. Over the summer my friend brought me back a jersey from his trip to london but didn't get it printed. I have been dying to get it printed but I can't commit, I thought bale was the no brainer but my constant concern that he'll leave keeps stopping me. 
That being said I would think Dempsey would be my number #2 choice, but I already have his USA jersey so I figure that's already half supporting tottenham and half supporting my USA love. So my question guys, who ya think I should get? I can only say that since adebayor's red card in arsenal, I am unable to support him like I did last year.

Spanish wonderkid. Understudy to Brad Jones at the Hair Institute for Gods. 19 years old and a product of the Liverpool FC Academy. 

He came to Liverpool in the fall of 2010 with a lot of expectation (a common trend with promising young Spaniards). A lot of what we heard in the beginning had to do with the amount of time he spent in front of the mirror working on his locks.

Having arrived initially as a central midfielder/playmaker due to his amazing long-range passing ability and vision, he began playing in a striker's role at the tip of a 4231 formation under the direction of Frank McParland.

Dropped into the #10 position due to his trickery, dribbling and flair, he developed further as a player. Coaching staff began to recognize that Suso was less of a goal threat in the #10 position with players like Ngoo thriving more off of crosses. He was moved to the right midfield of the 4231 where his cutting in, dribbling, shooting and passing were exploited to the fullest.

Now playing as a right winger, occasional left winger and even as a false 9 at times, Suso is catching the eyes of fans and players everywhere. 

So, with all the in mind, where do you think Suso's future on the pitch lies? Where will he be best used?",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Jesús Joaquín Fernández Sáez de la Torre,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/174pzj/jesús_joaquín_fernández_sáez_de_la_torre/

What really got my attention was that we could rent games. I have a whole list of games I'd love to play but wouldn't be able to afford (even if they're pre-owned, I'm side-eyeing you, GAME)... and Netflix (well, just the EU one, not the US) is starting to get boring, after a few months of going through what you really wanna watch, and what's left is like... old rom coms from the 80's or something. I'm quite upset that some shows have only a certain amount of seasons, like Mythbusters for example, only up to season 5? come on!

Another thing is, I'm ok with paying 6 quid for Netflix a month, and as far as I'm aware, streaming only on Lovefilm is 5 quid. But with the add on of DVDs and games, it's about 12 a month. That's twice of what I'm paying for Netflix which I use almsot daily on all my devices (Xbox, PS3, WiiU, iPad, PC, etc -yeah I just put Netflix on whatever device I happen to be using at the time).

So, is there anyone that is currently subscribed to Lovefilm, is it worth it? Is the streaming quality good on your device? I've never rented a DVD/game before, and if you have, what are your experiences with it?

For those who do not know, The Bedroom Tax will come into affect this April for anyone renting from The Council or The Housing Association. It will cut between **£11 and £20 per week** the amount of benefit that people can get if they are considered to have a spare bedroom

It's a tax taking money away from the poorest people already at the bottom of the ladder. This is taking money off people on benefits living in Council/Housing Association homes, not wealthy people with mansions.

I've tried to think of some examples, but I'm sure there are better ones that emphasise how ridiculous this tax is.

* Single mum with 2 year old baby. Doesn't have many skills and relies on benefits to survive. She will be paying extra because she has a extra room.
* Single dad, lives in a 2 bedroom council flat. Has a 2nd room for when his son visits. Pays extra as his son does not live there.

Don't take this the wrong way. I think downsizing is a good idea. You should only have what you need. In reality, the list for single bedroom or two bedroom flats/houses is going to sky rocket come April. People are going to be forced to pay extra while they wait and it's these people on benefits who will suffer.

So to cheer her up I threw together a story based around Karen Hallion's Disney/Doctor Who artwork (http://khallion.deviantart.com). Now that there's a Rapunzel and Snow White picture I need to add on, but this was what I came up with one sentence at a time in the span of 3 minutes a few months back: 

After the Doctor read Amy's letter he gained the closure he needed, and taking the advice of his best friend he vowed not to travel alone. So in searching for a companion, he needed to find someone who was looking for the same thing as himself: adventure. Someone whose mind was open, who refused to limit themselves to the world someone else had prescribed for them. And lo and behold, such an adventurous soul appeared. Traveling through Germany in the mid 1600s the Doctor encountered a young girl with an imagination too large for her own little world, and as she tried to go to a life she thought she wanted, the doctor offered her so much more.
 
http://www.robotmutant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cinderella-dr-who.jpg
 
         So the doctor and the young girl traveled the universe for a time, but as is the case with companions of the past she realized there was something in her own backyard she needed; the love of the handsome prince who saw her for who she truly was the whole time. And so the Doctor dropped her off and set off again in search of another adventure.
 
            After scouring time some more he once again found someone who longed to see everything that ever was and ever will be. As the Doctor piloted his TARDIS near the 1750s his controls seized, plunging him into the ocean (fortunately the people of Gallifrey long since evolved past the need for oxygen) and as he stepped out he encountered just the girl who needed him the most.

         Thanks to the chameleon arch the young mermaid was able to walk as a human, and her and the Doctor set out for lands (and worlds) unknown. They soon became the best of friends (as her red hair and spunky attitude reminded him of two recent friends who'd come and gone), but time only stands still for the Doctor. Eventually the young girl's heart couldn't deny it belonged to the sea, and the Doctor returned her to her home and bid her farewell. But where, the Doctor wondered, to go next?
 
           Fortunately his next companion was not far behind. A few decades ahead and quite a few countries forward, he found her; yet another young girl who realized that life was meant to be experienced as opposed to just lived through. Stopping into a quaint French village with no more intention then to find a particular crepe shop he'd enjoyed in the past, his path crossed with this young woman with the heart for adventure, and just like that a new friendship was formed.
